PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2, 2021. Human studies with adults aged /C2118 y older were included.Energy intake and compensation studies were restricted to acute effects (intervention duration of /C2024 h), whereas intervention duration was not limited for EE studies.Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to explore weighted mean differences in REE.Twenty-eight articles from 27 studies (16 energy intake studies, 10 EE studies, and 1 study investigating both) with 1121 participants were included in this review, with a variety of nut types addressed (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, chestnuts, hazelnuts, peanuts, pistachios, walnuts, and mixed nuts).Energy compensation occurred after nut-containing loads(range: /C0280.5% to þ176.4%) and the degree of compensation varied depending on the form (whole and chopped) and how they were consumed (alone and within a meal).
The meta-analyses identi ﬁed a nonsigni ﬁcant increase in REE associated with nut consumption (weighted mean difference: 28.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: /C010.7, 67.8 kcal/d). This study provided support for energy compensation as a potential mechanism for a lack of association between nut consumption and body weight, whereas no evidence was found for EE as an energy-regulating mechanism of nuts.This review was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021252292.Keywords : nuts, tree nuts, peanuts, energy compensation, energy intake, energy expenditure, systematic review, meta-analysis Introduction Obesity is a prevalent issue in Australia and around the world [1,2].Body weight is maintained by achieving energy balance, where energy intake and EE are equal.Weight gain typicallyoccurs when energy intake exceeds EE, and the opposite is often true for weight loss.
Energy intake from food and beverages is in part regulated in the body by appetite, hunger, and fullnesssensations, with different foods and beverages affecting thesesensations in varied ways. Daily EE comprises REE and the TEFand exercise [ 3].Of these components, basal metabolic rate is the largest component of REE and is de ﬁned as the minimum energy required for vital body functions, such as respiration andcirculation [ 4] and is usually measured during morning sleep to capture a true basal metabolic rate [ 3].By contrast, REE is deﬁned as the energy expended while resting and is measured as such [ 5].Therefore, the terms basal metabolic rate and REE are often used interchangeably in the literature.Tree nuts and peanuts are energy and nutrient dense [ 6].Because of their demonstrated health bene ﬁts, regular con- sumption of 30 g/d of nuts is recommended [ 7–12].
Moreover, the evidence suggests that nut consumption is associated with alower body weight, despite their energy density [ 13–15]. Observational studies have shown that habitual nut consumptionis inversely associated with weight gain and obesity risk [ 16,17].A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohorts and randomized Abbreviations used: AUSNUT, Australian Food and Nutrient Database; WMD, weighted mean difference.* Corresponding author.E-mail address: cn848@uowmail.edu.au (C.J.Nikodijevic).journal homepage: www.journals.elsevier.com/advances-in-nutrition https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2022.10.006 Received 17 July 2022; Received in revised form 12 October 2022; Accepted 28 October 2022; Available online 17 December 2022 2161-8313/ ©2022 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of American Society for Nutrition.
This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 77 –98 controlled trials (RCTs) combined these ﬁndings showing that nut consumption is associated with a lower incidence of over-weight or obesity and a lower body weight [ 15]. Furthermore, the way that nuts are included in an eating pattern may affect theresults.A recent systematic review has found that participantsdecreased their body fat in studies that instructed nuts to be substituted into the eating pattern, yet no change in participant body weight was found in studies which did not provide sub-stitution instructions [ 14].An understanding of the reasons for this difference is not well established.Studies have been conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the lack of association between nutintake and body weight.Nuts have a hunger-suppressing effect,yet their consumption does not promote fullness [ 13,18].
Hence, it is thought that the energy contained within nuts may becompensated for at later eating events [ 19–21]. That is, a reduction in energy intake may be provoked by the previous consumption of nuts.Energy compensation can be acute, with the effects measured at the next meal or for the remainder of theday, whereas chronic effects can be measured over a longerperiod of weeks or months.Several studies have suggested that regular nut consumption may increase EE [ 22–25], although the results are not conclu- sive.Mechanisms that may explain this potential increase in EEinclude the high protein and fat content of nuts and the fatty acidproﬁle of nuts, consisting of mostly unsaturated fatty acids, which are preferentially oxidized over saturated fatty acids [ 22, 23].Further to this, the effect of nut consumption on EE can be measured over a short period (as TEF) or long period (as REE).
Although studies have examined the effects of nut consump- tion on energy intake compensation and EE, the studies need tobe synthesized to enhance our understanding of the mechanismsof all tree nuts and peanuts. Therefore, the aim of this study wasto synthesize the body of evidence on the effect of tree nut andpeanut consumption on energy compensation (acute effects) andEE (acute and chronic effects).Materials and Methods Search strategy This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [ 26] and registered with PROSPERO ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ , CRD4 2021252292).Five scienti ﬁc databases —PubMed, MEDLINE (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase(Elsevier) —were searched from inception through to June 2, 2021 by 1 reviewer (CJN).
Although MEDLINE is a subset ofPubMed, both databases were searched to ensure that recentstudies were captured, following the recommendations by Rosenand Suhami [ 27]. There were no restrictions to the language or date published.Alternative spelling, phrases, and truncationswere included in the search strings, using both free-text searchterms and relevant controlled vocabulary.The search stringswere piloted, including testing whether searches identi ﬁed sentinel articles that were previously recognized as being likely to be eligible for the review [ 19,23,25,28].The search strings used in all 5 databases are provided in Supplementary Material 1.After the search, backward and forward citation searching of eligible articles was conducted using citationchaser [ 29].Selection criteria RCTs (including feeding studies) with either a crossover or parallel design were eligible for inclusion in this review.
Studies needed to meet the following criteria: include adults aged /C2118 y; explore the consumption of almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews,chestnuts, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios,walnuts, and/or peanuts, in the form of whole nuts, choppednuts, nut butters or nut ﬂours, or nut-containing foods where the results could be isolated to nuts; and assess acute energycompensation or acute energy intake (in kilojoules or calories) orEE (as basal metabolic rate, REE, TEE, TEF, or diet-inducedthermogenesis). Acute energy compensation and energy intakewere de ﬁned as energy intake measured for a maximum of a 24-h period and could be explored at the subsequent meal after nut consumption, the remainder of the day, or during a whole 24-h period.
This review was restricted to acute energy compensa-tion and energy intake to understand the effects of nut intake in acontrolled setting without the in ﬂuence of other factors (such as lifestyle and overall diet) that could interfere with energycompensation/intake ﬁndings in chronic studies. Studies were excluded if they were conducted with children or animals;investigated coconuts (owing to differences in nutrient compo-sition when compared with tree nuts and peanuts), nut oils, andnut milks; and were of a systematic review or in vitro design.Screening and data extraction Database searches and backward and forward citation searching were conducted by 1 reviewer (CJN).Title/abstractand full-text screening were performed independently by 2 re-viewers (CJN screened all search results and YCP and S-YT, eachscreened half of all results) using Covidence systematic reviewsoftware (Veritas Health Innovation; www.covidence.org ).
Conﬂicts that arose at either the title/abstract or full-text stages were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached amongthe 3 reviewers (CJN, YCP, and S-YT), with an additionalreviewer (EPN) consulted as required. Separate summary tableswere created for the energy compensation and EE ﬁndings and included the study details, such as study design, country, popu-lation, sample size, mean body mass index (BMI) and mean ageof participants, control and interventional diets, nut type, nutform, nut dose, intervention duration, measurement of energyintake/expenditure, and outcomes (i.e., energy intake and EE).Study details were extracted by one reviewer (CJN) and sourcedata was veri ﬁed [30] by a second reviewer (EPN).WebPlotDi- gitizer online software [ 31] was used to extract numeric values of results that were presented in a graphical format only.At-tempts were made to contact the study authors to retrieve datathat were not provided in the published articles.
Where study authors calculated energy compensation, these values were reported in the summary tables. In case authors didnot calculate energy compensation, energy compensation wascalculated by the review authors.Two authors (CJN and S-YT)reviewed the energy compensation formula developed by Kirk-meyer and Mattes [ 18], which was applied by CJN using a Microsoft Excel (version 16, Microsoft Corporation, 2021) tem- plate ( Supplementary Material 2 ) to calculate the energy compensation in remaining studies.The energy provided by nutsin the intervention was a required component of this calculation,and when it was not provided by the authors, the Australian Foodand Nutrient Database (AUSNUT) 2011 –2013 Food NutrientC.J.Nikodijevic et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 77 –98 78 Database [ 32] was used to determine the energy content of nuts.
If the AUSNUT 2011 –2013 Food Nutrient Database did not provide data for a particular nut type or form (for example,hazelnut ﬂour), then a food product label was used to determine the energy content. Calculating energy compensation wasnecessary to compare the effects between studies that varied between study designs.Based on the formula, the energy compensation values can be interpreted as the percentage of energy from nuts beingcompensated in subsequent energy intake.Negative valuesindicate not only a lack of energy compensation but also a nut-promoted energy intake.Values between 0% and þ100% were deemed to indicate partial energy compensation, whereby,although the energy intake did increase, the increase was lessthan the energy provided by the nut addition.A value of þ100% indicated complete compensation, namely no change in energyintake after nut addition.
Values above þ100% indicated energy compensation was beyond the energy provided by the nuts and, therefore, resulted in lower subsequent energy intake (i.e.,overcompensation). Because of variation in outcomes and measurement methods, synthesis via meta-analysis was only considered appropriate forthe studies that reported the effects of nut consumption on REEor basal metabolic rate (treated as REE for the synthesis).Asmentioned previously, the terms basal metabolic rate and REEare often used interchangeably.For the purpose of this reviewand meta-analysis, the terms were combined and treated as REE.For the meta-analysis, the mean values, standard deviation, and sample size of studies examining the effect of nut consumption on REE were extracted as recommended by the CochraneHandbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ 33].Change values for REE were extracted where published; otherwise, ﬁnal values were obtained.
Study authors were contacted to retrieveor con ﬁrm data if the article did not provide suf ﬁcient infor- mation. Where standard error was provided instead of standarddeviation, the values were transformed to standard deviationusing the formula provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-tematic Reviews of Interventions (chapter 6.5.2.2) [ 33].Where a study included more than 1 relevant intervention arm, data for the intervention arms were combined [ 33].Statistical analyses Random effects meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan Computer Program, version 5.4; the Cochrane Collaboration, 2020).Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% con ﬁdence intervals were determined for change or ﬁnal values for REE.Acute studies were not included in the analysesowing to the variation in outcomes.Studies were included in themeta-analyses if they measured REE in a chronic context and hadsufﬁcient data.
Data from the ﬁrst intervention period of cross- over studies was used for comparability with parallel study data,as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for SystematicReviews of Interventions [ 33]. The proportion of total variation attributable to between- study heterogeneity was estimated using the I 2statistic, which was generated for each analysis.An I2value of at least 75% in- dicates a high level of inconsistency, based on recommendationsby Higgins et al.[ 34].Funnel plots were deemed inappropriate owing to the low number of studies ( <10) included.Sensitivity analyses were conducted to further explore the results.Wherestudies had several intervention arms that could be considered controls, for the purpose of this analysis, the data from thenonnut intervention arms were combined with the control armdata to observe the effect of additional controls.A leave-one-outsensitivity analysis was conducted to observe the effect ofremoving a single study at a time on the outcomes.
Quality assessment Quality appraisal of the included studies was performed independently by 2 reviewers (CJN, EPN) using the Academy ofNutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist —Primary Research [ 35]. Any disagreements between the reviewers were resolved by discussion to consensus.Results Study characteristics and quality A total of 14,538 articles were identi ﬁed across the 5 data- bases.After the removal of duplicate articles and excludedstudies, 24 articles were identi ﬁed as eligible.An additional 4 articles were identi ﬁed after forward and backward citation searching, bringing the total number of articles included in thisreview to 28, derived from 27 studies [ 18,19,22,24,25,36–58].Figure 1 shows the study selection process.Of note, 2 studies [38,59] were excluded as they measured EE through methods other than indirect calorimetry: in this case, by estimating EEusing physical activity records.
There were 16 studies that re-ported energy compensation [ 18,38,40–43,45–48,50–55], 10 studies that reported EE [ 19,22,24,25,39,44,49,56–58], and 1 study (2 articles) that investigated both [ 36,37].Tables 1 and 2 present the characteristics of the energy compensation studiesand EE studies, respectively. The study quality ranged from neutral ( n¼2) [19,52]t o positive ( n¼25).The reasons for neutral quality scores included authors not discussing the study limitations and not disclosing conﬂicts of interests or funding sources.Energy intake/compensation studies All studies that examined the effect of nut consumption on energy intake or compensation ( n¼17) were of an RCT design with either crossover or parallel arms and were conducted incountries including the USA [ 18,41,42,47,52,53], Brazil [ 37,45, 47,54,55], France [ 43,48], the UK [ 50,51], New Zealand [ 40, 46], Australia [ 38], and Ghana [ 47](Table 1 ).The sample size ranged from 11 to 201 participants across the 17 studies.
Eleven studies [ 18,38,40–42,45–47,52–54] included both adult men and women, 5 studies [ 43,48,50,51,55] women only, and 1 study [ 37] men only. The types of nuts that were studied included peanuts ( n¼8), almonds ( n¼5), pistachios ( n ¼2), walnuts ( n¼1), cashews ( n¼1), hazelnuts ( n¼1), Brazil nuts ( n¼1), and chestnuts ( n¼1).Notably, although most studies investigated only 1 type of nut, 2 studies investigatedmultiple nut types [ 18,45].The physical forms of nuts included whole nuts ( n¼14), ground nuts ( n¼3), nut butters ( n¼3), sliced nuts ( n¼1), and nut ﬂours ( n¼1).Heat processing forms of nuts included raw nuts ( n¼5), roasted nuts ( n¼5), and baked chestnuts ( n¼1).However, 3 studies [ 47,48,53] did not specify the form of nuts used.C.J.Nikodijevic et al.
Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 77 –98 79 Of the 17 studies, 9 [ 18,38,40,43,48,50,51,53,54] provided nuts alone as a snack, 7 [ 37,41,42,45,46,52,55] provided nuts as part of a larger snack or meal (mixed with other foods), and 1 [47] study investigated nut consumption both alone and as part of a mixed meal. The dose of nuts provided as part of a mixedmeal or snack ranged from 20 to 56 g/d, and the dose of nutswhen consumed alone ranged from 23 to 87.5 g/d, with theexception of 1 study [ 18] which provided 235.8 g of baked chestnuts as a snack.Two studies [ 40,50] individualized the nut dose based on the participants ’energy requirements or body weight.In 10 studies [ 37,38,40–43,45,47,52,54], the nut-containing intervention was compared with an isocaloriccontrol meal.Two studies [ 48,51] compared nut consumption with a control of nil energy intake, and another 2 studies [ 46,55] compared nut consumption with a control snack that was not isocaloric to the intervention.
Three studies [ 18,50,53] compared a nut-containing intervention with both nil energyintake and a snack (either isocaloric or of different energycontent). Energy intake was the main outcome measured in energy intake studies.However, the duration during which intake wasmeasured varied among studies.Five studies [ 18,46,47,53,55] reported only the total daily energy intake (including energyintake before, during, and after the consumption of nuts),whereas another 5 studies [ 41,43 ,48,50,51] that reported total daily energy intake also separated the data into meal occasions.Five studies [ 37,40,42,45,52] reported only energy intake after the consumption of nuts, with or without data separated intomeals.One study [ 38] measured energy intake only at the sub- sequent meal after the nut consumption, and another study [ 54]measured energy intake for a 24-h period after the nut con- sumption.
The methods used to quantify energy intake include acombination of a food record dietary methodology and measuring plate waste from a preweighed buffet. Energy compensation was a secondary outcome reported in 2 studies[18,37] and was calculated by the reviewers in 14 studies [ 38, 40–43,45–48,50,51,53–55].Findings for energy intake/compensation Next-meal energy intake Seven of the 17 energy intake studies reported energy intake at the next meal (e.g., lunch) ( Table 2 ).In 4 of the 7 studies, energy intake at the subsequent meal was signi ﬁcantly lower after consumption of nuts compared with consumption of acontrol snack or no snack [ 38,48,50,51].Three of the 7 studies did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant differences in energy intake at the subsequent meal after the nut consumption compared with that in the control arm [ 40,41,45].
Energy intake in subsequent meals Nine of the 17 energy compensation studies reported energy intakes for numerous eating occasions after the intervention(e.g., lunch and dinner) ( Table 2 ). Only 1 of these 9 studies found a signi ﬁcantly lower energy intake for the remainder of the day after the consumption of nuts versus a control snack [ 40].Seven of the 9 studies did not report any signi ﬁcant differences in en- ergy intake in subsequent meals after nut consumption [ 37,42, 43,45,48,52,54].One study investigated the effects of 2 doses of almonds on energy intakes and found no effect on energy intake FIGURE 1.Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ﬂow diagram of the study selection protocol.C.J.Nikodijevic et al.

Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 77 –98 83 after the 28-g dose and signi ﬁcantly lower energy intakes after the 42-g dose, when comparing nut consumption with water[51]. Daily energy intake Ten of the 17 energy compensation studies reported the total daily energy intake on the day of the intervention, includingenergy intake before, during, and after the intervention(Table 2 ).One study reported a signi ﬁcantly lower daily energy intake in the intervention arm versus control [ 48].The remain- ing 9 studies did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant effect of nut con- sumption on daily energy intake [ 18,41,43,46,47,50,51,53,55].Energy compensation Energy compensation was calculated for 16 of the 17 energy intake studies to allow for comparison between the studies(Figure 2 ).In 2 of the 17 energy intake studies, energy compensation was measured and reported in the articles [ 18,37].
Energy compensation was calculated by reviewers in 14 of the 17 studies, whereas 1 of the 17 studies did not provide suf ﬁcient information to calculate energy compensation [ 52]. Therefore, the energy compensation results are provided for 16 studies.In 2 [ 43,53] of the 16 studies, energy compensation was greater than the energy provided by the nuts, that is, over-compensation, with energy compensation greater than þ100%.For example, a study by Carughi et al.[ 43] reported a habitual energy intake of 8705 kJ and 7860 kJ on the test day whenpistachios (1242 kJ) were consumed, leading to an energycompensation of þ168.0%.In 5 [ 38,40,48,50,54] of the 16 studies, partial energy compensation occurred, indicated by a value between 0% and 100%.In 4 [ 41,42,45,55] of the 16 studies, energy compensation did not occur, re ﬂected by an in- crease in energy intake with nut consumption.In the remaining 5 studies, energy compensation varied because of several interventions in each study.
Alves et al. [ 37] compared energy compensation of conventional peanuts and high-oleic peanuts and found a higher degree of compensationwith conventional peanuts ( þ134.2% vs.þ84.0%), suggesting that a difference in fatty acid pro ﬁles affects energy compensa- tion.Kirkmeyer and Mattes [ 18] investigated energy compen- sation among various nuts and nut products.The highest energy compensation was reported for peanut butter ( þ151%), followed by peanuts ( þ104%), almonds ( þ57%), and chestnuts ( þ57%) [18].In a study by Devi et al.[ 46], a bread containing semi-defatted hazelnut ﬂour promoted subsequent energy intake (energy compensation: /C011.2%), however, this effect was reversed when combining the ﬂour with sliced hazelnuts in bread ( þ149.4%; overcompensation) which had a greater effect on energy compensation than that by bread containing onlysliced hazelnuts ( þ16.5%; partial compensation).
The hazelnut ﬂour bread arm was the only arm to have an increased energy intake on the test day when compared with the control (8904 kJ vs. 8832 kJ) [ 46].In a study by Devitt et al.[ 47], partial compensation occurred for 1 of the interventions —a snack mix containing peanuts —whereas compensation did not occur for the peanut intervention ( þ20.0% and /C02.6%, respectively).Finally, in a study by Hull et al.[ 51], partial compensation occurred for the 28-g dose ( þ72.1%) and overcompensation occurred for the 42-g dose ( þ114.7%), suggesting a potential dose–response effect.TABLE 1 (continued ) Reference; countryStudy design Population; mean BMI (kg/m2); mean age (y)Sample size (completers)Control diet Intervention diet Nut type, form, and doseDuration of measurementFood intake measurement Quality appraisal recorded all food anddrink consumed for the rest of the day F, female; M, male; PB, peanut butter; WP, whole peanuts.

The sample size ranged from 15 to 71 participants, and 6 studies [ 19,22,39,44,56,58] included both men and women, 3 studies (from 4 articles) [ 24,36,37,49] men only, and 2 studies [25,57] women only. Each study investigated only 1 type of nut, and types included walnuts ( n¼5), peanuts ( n¼2), almonds ( n ¼2), hazelnuts ( n¼1), and mixed nuts ( n¼1).Various forms of nuts were explored, such as whole nuts, ground nuts, roastednuts, and raw nuts.Some studies investigated multiple forms ofnuts, and 7 studies [ 22,24,39,49,56–58] did not specify the forms of nuts that were used.Of the 11 studies, 3 studies [ 24,39,56] investigated nuts consumed as part of a mixed meal, 2 studies [ 49 ,57] the con- sumption of nuts alone, and 1 study (2 articles) [ 36,37] both.
In 5 studies [ 19,22,25,44,58], it was not clear how the nuts were being consumed (alone or mixed with other foods) because of thechronic nature of the studies where participants were instructedto consume nuts every day for weeks or months. The dose of nutconsumption ranged from 25 to 100 g/d, although 1 study [ 24] did not report the dose of walnuts.Four studies [ 19,22,44,56] individualized the nut dose based on participants ’energy re- quirements or body weight.In 8 [ 22,24,36,37,39,44,49,56,57] of the 11 studies, nut consumption was compared with anisocaloric control snack.In 2 studies [ 19,25], daily nut con- sumption was compared with the control arm, which followed their regular diet, and in 1 study [ 58], participants followed their regular pattern of eating with the addition of no snacks (control)TABLE 2 (continued ) Reference; country Energy intake (control diet) Energy intake (intervention diet) Energy compensation Lunch intake: 1019.6 (SD: 345.6) kcal ( P <0.05 vs.

EE was measured both acutely (postprandial EE measured immediately after nut consumption) and chronically (REEmeasured after a longer-term intervention).The study durationvaried from 1 d to 6 mo.Five studies [ 24,37,49,56,57] explored postprandial EE in an acute context.Seven studies [ 19,22,25,36, 39,44,58] explored REE in a chronic context.EE was measured using indirect calorimetry, and in all studies that measured REE,participants were fasted and resting during the measurement,except for 2 studies [ 24,39], which did not specify the conditions.Findings for EE Studies assessing the effect of nut consumption on acute EE (<24 h) Five of the 11 EE studies investigated outcomes in an acute context ( Table 4 ).Three of these studies reported signi ﬁcant results, but these results were con ﬂicting among the studies [ 24, 37,49].Gepner et al.

A study by Alves et al.[ 37] reported that the consumption of high-oleic peanuts elicited a higher postprandialEE that by regular peanuts and the control snack (biscuits);however, the difference was only statistically signi ﬁcant when comparing high-oleic and regular peanuts.Furthermore, post- prandial EE was signi ﬁcantly lower after consuming regular peanuts than that after biscuits [ 37].Casas-Agustench et al.[ 24] explored TEF after consuming walnuts and found increased TEFwhen comparing walnuts with a high-saturated fatty acid mealand a high-monounsaturated fatty acid meal; however, the dif-ference was only statistically signi ﬁcant when comparing wal- nuts with the high-saturated fatty acid meal.The remaining 2studies that examined acute EE did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant effect of nuts on postprandial EE [ 56,57].
Studies assessing the effect of chronic nut consumption on EE Seven of the 11 EE studies explored outcomes in a chronic context ( Table 4 ). Of these studies, 5 studies [ 22,25,36,44,58] were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analyses.These studiesexplored nut supplementation over 2 –12 wk (acute studies were excluded owing to the variation in outcomes), measured REE andhad suf ﬁcient data to include in the analyses.The types of nuts included peanuts ( n¼2), almonds ( n¼1), hazelnuts ( n¼1), and a combination of tree nuts and peanuts ( n¼1).The meta-analysis showed that nut consumption was associated witha nonsigni ﬁcant increase in REE, with a WMD of 28.6 kcal/d (95% CI: /C010.7, 67.8 kcal/d), as presented in Figure 3 .The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the removal of thestudy by Alves et al.[ 36] resulted in a signi ﬁcant effect (WMD: 63.9 kcal/d; 95% CI: 3.4, 124.4 kcal/d), although removal ofother studies did not alter the effect ( Supplementary Material 3 ).
Sensitivity analyses examining the effect of combining multiplecontrol arms [involving nonnut interventions by Tey et al. [ 58]] found similar results to the primary analysis (WMD: 27.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: /C013.9, 69.1 kcal/d), presented in Supplementary Ma- terial 3 .Two studies [ 19,39] included in the systematic review were not eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis because they didnot have suf ﬁcient data available, either in the publication orafter contacting the study authors.Neither of these studies found a signi ﬁcant effect of nut consumption on EE, with 1 study reporting a nonsigni ﬁcant decrease in REE [ 19], whereas the other study did not provide EE values but instead reported thatthey did not ﬁnd any REE changes [ 39].Discussion Energy compensation is a plausible mechanism that may explain the lack of an effect of nut consumption on body weightobserved in the literature [ 13–15].
The degree of energy compensation seems to be dependent on whether nuts are eaten alone as a snack or as part of a mixed meal, with stronger energycompensation observed when nuts are consumed on their own asa snack. However, the ﬁndings of this review suggest that nut consumption has no signi ﬁcant effect on EE.Although meta-analyses showed a small increase in REE associated withregular nut consumption, the effect is lacking statistical andclinical signi ﬁcance.The effect of nuts on diet-induced thermo- genesis is also inconsistent and inconclusive.Although a previ-ous systematic review explored the effect of nut consumption onenergy intake [ 13], our review expanded this by focusing on acute energy intake compensation, in addition to examining the effect of nut intake on EE, to provide a more complete view of theeffects of nuts on human energy balance regulation.Energy compensation In this review, energy intake after nut consumption was explored over an acute period only.
The intervention durationwas restricted to a 24-h period to focus on the effects of nutintake speci ﬁcally, rather than other potential factors that can inﬂuence dietary behaviors over a longer duration. The nutrient proﬁle of tree nuts and peanuts is likely a contributing factor to their energy compensation effects.Peanuts and tree nuts arenutrient dense, being high in protein, ﬁber, and vitamins, min- erals, and phytosterols [ 6].Food high in protein and ﬁber are known to be satiating [ 60] and are important to consider when choosing healthy meals and snacks.However, energy compen-sation ranged from /C0280.5% [ 42]t oþ176.4% [ 53], and the ﬁndings of this systematic review suggest that energy compen- sation is stronger when nuts are consumed alone as opposed toincluding nuts in a meal.The study by Burton-Freeman et al [ 42] found that the addition of almonds to a breakfast meal promoted subsequent food intake, with the lowest energy compensation of /C0280.5%.
One other study [ 55] investigated the addition of either whole peanuts or peanut butter to a breakfast meal andfound an increase in food intake. The literature has shown that consuming healthy, whole foods as a snack increases satiety and helps regulate appetitethroughout the day [ 61].For this reason, when nuts are consumed as a snack, as opposed to nuts being combined withother foods in a meal, energy compensation is likely to begreater.This concept has also been explored in the literature.AnRCT found that almonds were more effective at reducing hunger when they were being consumed as a snack, rather than part of a meal [ 62].Similar research has been conducted in other foods.A study by Mattes and Campbell [ 63] explored the effect of timing and food form on appetite, with consumption of an apple (solid),apple sauce (semisolid), or apple juice (liquid) either with a mealC.J.Nikodijevic et al.

1Sample size: n¼14 for adjusted; n¼16 for nonadjusted. 2Baseline RMR for 52 participants.C.J.Nikodijevic et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 77 –98 93 or alone as a snack compared.The authors concluded that the apple elicited the strongest appetitive response, followed byapple sauce and apple juice, and that this effect was strongerwhen the apple was consumed as a snack as opposed to with ameal [ 63].Therefore, consuming whole foods as snacks —particularly those that take a solid form and are high in protein or ﬁber—may regulate appetite throughout the day, as suggested in the literature [ 61], and may provoke a stronger compensatory effect than when added to meals.Besides the timing of nut consumption in meals versus snacks, nutﬂours and nuts that were ﬁnely ground did not provoke energy compensation and instead resulted in an increased energyintake.
Nut ﬂours and ground nuts contain smaller particle sizes and, therefore, do not require the same level of mastication aswhen consuming whole nuts. The act of mastication reduces foodintake and promotes satiety [ 64].Cassady et al.[ 65] investigated the effect of mastication of almonds on appetite and found hunger suppression and increased appetite after 40 chewscompared with that after 25 chews and signi ﬁcantly lower glucagon-like peptide 1 after 25 chews than that after 40 chews.Therefore, energy compensation may be greater with whole nutsthan with ground nuts and nut ﬂours.In addition, 2 studies [ 41, 45] that investigated ﬁnely ground nuts mixed into shakes (beverages), which did not require mastication, did not showevidence of energy compensation.
A systematic review of energycompensation after the consumption of a range of preloads(including liquid preloads such as beverages, shakes, and soups; semisolid preloads such as yogurts and chunky soups; and solid preloads such as vegetables, breads and meat, and compositemeals) found that the physical form of the preloads was acontributing factor to differences in energy compensation andthat solid and semisolid preloads increased energy compensation[66]. Moreover, another study found that solid foods are more satiating than liquids, which may explain why solid foods typi-cally promote energy compensation [ 67].The physical form of tree nuts and peanuts seems to affect subsequent energy intakeand energy compensation effects, so a recommendation toconsume nuts in their whole form would be appropriate to pre-vent excessive energy intake.The effects of peanut butter consumption on energy intake and compensation varied [ 18,55].
One study [ 55] reported greater energy intake after peanut butter consumption (i.e., nocompensation), whereas the other study [ 18] reported over- compensation with peanut butter. However, the former studyincluded peanut butter in a breakfast meal, whereas, in the latter,peanut butter was consumed alone.This may explain the varied results for peanut butter given the ﬁndings of this review suggest that energy compensation is weaker when nuts are consumedwithin a meal, although more research is required to furtherunderstand this relationship.Kirkmeyer and Mattes [ 18] inves- tigated both whole peanuts and peanut butter, which were both consumed alone, and found that both elicited strong energycompensatory effects.Therefore, peanut butter and whole pea-nuts may provoke a similar degree of energy compensation whenthey are consumed alone; however, future research shouldcontinue to investigate the energy compensatory effects of nutbutters.
When considered separately from whether nuts are consumed as meals or snacks, the time of nut consumption (for example,morning vs. afternoon) within a single day did not seem to affectthe level of energy compensation.As discussed previously, nut intake at a morning breakfast meal did not produce an energy compensation effect; however, snacking on nuts in the morningdid result in partial or overcompensation in several studies.Allstudies instructed participants to consume nuts or nut-containingintervention in the morning, except for 2 [ 43,47] which inves- tigated nut consumption in the afternoon and saw variation inresults.By comparison with literature that has explored chroniceffects of nuts on energy compensation, regular nut intake withina diet over a longer period shows more consistent results.A studyby Sabat /C19e et al.[ 21] investigated energy compensation with regular walnut consumption compared with a habitual diet.
A minimally higher mean daily energy intake was observed with a walnut-supplemented diet than that with a habitual diet, but theincreased energy intake in the nut-containing diet was less thanexpected, indicating partial compensation had occurred [ 21]. Another study found that regular consumption of peanuts pro-voked partial energy compensation, even when no dietaryguidance was provided about how to incorporate the peanutsinto participants ’diets [ 23].Further research has identi ﬁed other bene ﬁcial outcomes associated with regular nut con- sumption, including weight loss and improved diet quality [ 68, 69].Habitual nut consumption, therefore, appears to have a greater effect on energy compensation than the timing of nut consumption.Across studies, there did not seem to be a dose –response effect of nut consumption on energy compensation.Only 1 study [ 51] included in this review compared 2 doses of nuts —am i d - m o r n i n g snack of either 28 or 42 g of almonds.
Although a highercompensatory effect was found with the higher dose in this study,FIGURE 3. Forest plot of the effect of tree nut and peanut consumption on REE (in kilocalories per day), categorized into subgroups based on mean change or ﬁnal values.Diamond indicates weighted mean difference with 95% CIs.C.J.Nikodijevic et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 77 –98 94 owing to the variation in results across all studies, the dose of nuts did not seem to affect the degree of energy compensation.Whether nuts are consumed as a snack or part of a meal orconsumed whole or ﬁnely chopped seems to be a greater predictor of energy compensation, likely because of the properties of nutsdiscussed previously.Future studies that investigate the energy compensation effects of nuts should include several doses to further understand whether a dose –response effect exists.EE Theﬁndings relating to the effect of nuts on EE were incon- sistent.
Studies were organized into acute (where interventionswere completed within 24 h) or chronic (interventions lasting>1 d) categories. Results varied considerably among acute studies.In 1 study [ 37], the consumption of high-oleic peanuts increased postprandial EE when compared with regular peanutconsumption.Another study included in this review found thatthe walnut-containing meal elicited a higher TEF than an oliveoil-containing meal and a dairy-containing meal [ 24].These ﬁndings suggest that the fatty acid pro ﬁle of nuts affects fat oxidation and hence EE.Research has shown that in healthy male subjects, olive oil (high in oleic acid) caused an increase in postprandial EE when compared with ﬂaxseed oil (high in lino- lenic acid; P<0.0006) and sun ﬂower oil (high in linoleic acid; P <0.06) [ 70].Another study has shown that oleic acid increases REE, whereas palmitic acid caused a decrease [ 71].
In this re- view, high-oleic peanuts were found to cause a greater increasein postprandial EE than regular peanuts. Approximately 54% ofthe fatty acids found in regular peanuts are monounsaturatedfatty acids (includes oleic acid), and this proportion increases to82% in high-oleic peanuts [ 72].Moreover, the literature has conﬁrmed that unsaturated fatty acids are more readily oxidized than saturated fatty acids [ 73–75], and this mechanism is likely the reason why nuts caused a greater increase in postprandial EE.There was no evidence to suggest that the long-term con- sumption of nuts affects REE.A meta-analysis of 5 chronicstudies found a nonsigni ﬁcant increase of 28.58 kcal/d in REE, consolidating the broader ﬁndings of this systematic review.The results of this review are similar to those of 2 studies, which wereexcluded from this review because physical activity records,rather than indirect calorimetry, were used to estimate EE [ 38, 59].
An increase in REE of 28.58 kcal/d is clinically insigni ﬁcant. It is estimated that a de ﬁcit of at least 500 kcal/d (by removing 500 kcal/d from the diet, increasing EE by 500 kcal/d, or a combination of diet and expenditure approaches) is required for healthy weight loss of approximately 500 g/wk [ 76].It is unclear why nut consumption has no effect on REE.Research has sug-gested that EE is higher with consumption of a high-protein dietcompared with high-carbohydrate or high-fat diets [ 77,78].In- creases in postprandial EE is also greatest after protein con-sumption and lowest after fat consumption [ 79].Given that nuts are high in both protein and fat, the nutrient pro ﬁle of tree nuts and peanuts may explain the inconsistent ﬁndings relating to postprandial EE and the lack of an effect on REE.Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the removal of the study by Alves et al.
[ 36], the highest weighted study in the meta-analysis, caused the effect of nut consumption on REE tobecome signi ﬁcant. One potential reason for this occurrence could be the differing results between the 2 intervention arms in thisstudy, which examined the effect of high-oleic and regular peanutconsumption, respectively.Although the results of both peanut interventions were combined into a single intervention for themeta-analysis, the study reported that REE was higher in thehigh-oleic peanut arm that in the control arm, whereas REE waslower in the regular peanut arm than in the control arm.The studypopulation of overweight or obese male participants in the study by Alves et al.[ 36] may partially explain this ﬁnding because EE is typically different between male and female subjects [ 80].
Study strengths and limitations The strengths of this review include the consideration of 2 energy regulation mechanisms of nuts —energy compensation and increased REE —to understand the lack of an effect of nut con- sumption on body weight previously reported in the literature[13–15]. Furthermore, in EE studies, both acute and chronic ef- fects were explored to further understand this mechanism.Ameta-analysis was conducted to explore the effect of chronic nutconsumption on REE.However, this review has some limitations.Chestnuts were eligible for inclusion in this review because theyare botanically considered a tree nut.However, they have adifferent nutrient composition to other tree nuts and peanuts, and for this reason, they are usually excluded from nut-related research.
Among energy compensation studies, energy intakewas measured at various time-points including at the subsequentmeal, energy intake postintervention and total daily energyintake, which may have resulted in the lack of consistent resultsobserved. As a result of the substantial variation between the typesof outcomes investigated, quantitative synthesis of results viameta-analysis was not considered appropriate for energy intakeand compensation studies.Circadian rhythm may potentially havean impact on REE; however, this was not accounted for among EEstudies.Finally, although the studies included in this review wereRCTs, there is the possibility that other factors such as a healthier lifestyle overall may have affected the ﬁndings.Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis has found evidence of energy compensation as a potential energy regulation mecha- nism of tree nuts and peanuts, at least in the short-term.No evi-dence was found for EE.
Energy compensation seems to bestronger when nuts are consumed alone rather than integratedinto a meal. In comparison, the consumption of nuts seemed tohave no impact on REE.More research is required to better un-derstand the effects of nut butter consumption on energycompensation, and various doses of nuts should be included infuture studies.Future research should continue to explore theeffect of nut consumption on postprandial EE because the resultsof our review were inconsistent.In addition, future studies should investigate understudied nuts, such as macadamias, pecans, and pine nuts, to better understand energy compensation and EE ef-fects across all types of nuts.The potential effect of nutrientcomposition of individual nut types and the gut microbiome onenergy compensation and EE should be explored in future studies.Funding This work was supported by Nuts for Life via a matching PhD scholarship which CJN receives (matching scholarship is equallyC.J.Nikodijevic et al.
