Introduction Vitamin B-12 deficiency isoften considered synonymous with pernicious anemia, arare con- dition manifesting asmegaloblastic erythropoiesis, hyperhomocystinemia, methylmalonic acidemia, and neurological syndromes (subacute combined degeneration ofcord, peripheral neuropathy, dementia and depression) [1].The primary defect inthiscondition isanear-total block inthegastrointestinal absorption ofvitamin B-12 which requires high-dose parenteral treatment. Indeveloping countries such asIndia, inadequate dietary intake ofB-12 dueto socio-cultural factors leads towidely prevalent asymptomatic lowB-12 status.Inthisscenario, lower doses oforal B-12 may beeffective, safer and more affordable.Inthelastfewdecades ithasbecome increasingly apparent that inadequate dietary intake ofvitamin B-12 isawidely prevalent cause oflowvitamin B-12 status inmany populations [2].
This predominantly affects vegetarians who donoteatadequate amounts ofanimal origin foods (milk, eggs, fish, chicken and meat) and lower socioeconomic groups who cannot afford them and vegans. Small doses oforal vitamin B-12 may beadequate toimprove vitamin status inthese individuals [3,4].There issparse information onthisissue.India isonesuch country where vitamin B-12 deficiency hasbeen reported insubstantial numbers [5–7].This hasbeen attributed mainly tovegetarian food habits, duetoreligious- socio-cultural factors and poverty, though other factors may contribute.Alarge majority of these individuals areasymptomatic and theB-12 deficiency may beevident only onlaboratory testing.There islimited information about their clinical, hematologic and biochemical response totreatment with near Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) doses ofvitamin B- 12.
Wehave reported asubstantial prevalence ofvitamin B-12 deficiency inpeople living in and around theIndian cityofPune [8].The majority areasymptomatic buthave demonstrable derangements inhematological and biochemical parameters [8].Low maternal B-12 status is prevalent inpregnancy and isassociated with fetal growth restriction [9,10] and with insulin resistance intheoffspring [11,12]. These findings suggested aneed forB-12 supplementation using apublic health approach.Inpreparation foralarge supplementation trial wedemon- strated adequate absorption ofvitamin B-12 inthemajority ofthispopulation using amodi- fied CobaSorb test(oral 2μgB-12 x3doses) [13] and also documented improved B-12 status with near RDA (“physiological” 2μg/day) doses oforal vitamin B-12 over oneyear [14].
The PRIYA trial (Pune Rural Intervention inYoung Adolescents, ISRCTN 32921044) [15], was Treatmen tofB12deficiency withoralphysiolog icaldoses inIndian adolescen twome n PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02230 00October 10,2019 2/8concordat agreement .Follow upinPRIYA trialis supported byaDBTcenter ofexcellen cegrant (BT/ 01/CEIB/12 /III/10 andBT/PR12629 /MED/97/364/ 2016). Thefunders hadnoroleinstudy design, datacollection andanalysis ,decision topublish, or preparation ofthemanuscript.Competing interests :Theauthors have declared thatnocompeting interests exist.thus designed toimprove thevitamin B-12 status ofadolescent participants inthePune Mater- nalNutrition Study (apreconceptional birth cohort established in1994–96) with anaim to improve health outcomes intheir offspring (Intervention started in2012).PRIYA isaplacebo- controlled trial and therefore wedecided toexclude and treat those with very lowvitamin B-12 status (<100 pmol/L) forethical reasons.
The current study was designed todocument theeffects oftreatment inthisexcluded group. Weperformed twosets ofmeasurements todocument theeffect ofanoral physiological dose ofB-12 (2μg/day), with thefollowing objectives: 1)Todocument changes inclinical, hematological, biochemical and nerve function.2)Tostudy 1-Carbon metabolic cycles after amethionine load using stable iso- topes.The first objective would provide useful information toguide public health policy about B-12 supplementation among women inthereproductive agegroup.And thesecond objective would provide mechanistic information in1-carbon cycles toimprove scientific understand- ing.The results oftheisotopic metabolic studies have been published [16].Wenow report the clinical, hematological, nutritional, biochemical-metabolic and peripheral nerve function mea- surements.Wehypothesised that treatment with oral physiological dose of2μg/day B-12 for 11months would improve theabove parameters favorably inthese women.
Materials andmethods Before starting thePRIYA trial, wemeasured plasma B-12 concentrations inalladolescents in thePune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS) cohort. Wedecided toexclude those with B-12 concentrations below 100pmol/L (15th centile) from thetrial and totreat them with B-12 because itwould beethically inappropriate torandomize them into aplacebo-controlled trial.According toIndian nutritional guidelines (Indian Council ofMedical Research, National Institute ofNutrition) therecommended daily dietary intake ofB-12 is1μg/day[17].This study wasapproved bytheInstitutional Ethics Committee ofKEM Hospital Research Center, Pune.Approval No.1112A(i).The ethics committee oftheKEM Hospital Research Centre approved atreatment dose of2μgB-12 onthebasis ofourprevious demonstration that this dose wasadequately absorbed bythemajority inthispopulation, and that itwasalso effica- cious inimproving B-12 status inaoneyear pilot trial[18].
Informed consent wasobtained from theparents and assent from theparticipants who were younger than 18years ofage. The study wascarried outin2012–2014.Participants were allocated toreceive either (a)vitamin B-12 only (cyanocobalamin 2μg/ day) or(b)cyanocobalamin 2μg/day +amultiple micronutrient tablet (UNIMAPP formula without folic acid) +20gmmilk powder made upwith water oradded tofood tomimic the twoactive treatment arms inthePRIYA trial[15].Allparticipants received 100mgiron and 500μgfolic acid tablet once aweek asperGovernment ofIndia guidelines.Measurements were carried outatbaseline and after 11months oftreatment.Physical examination included anthropometry (height and weight) and examination forstomatitis, glossitis and peripheral neuropathy (clinical examination forjoint sense; vibration, using a128 Hztuning fork; and light touch, using aSemmes Weinstein monofilament 5g,classified asnor- mal, impaired orabsent sensation).
Blood samples were centrifuged incold at4˚C within one hour ofsample collection and theseparated plasma and serum were stored at-80˚C foranaly- sislater. Hematological measurements (Complete Blood Count) were done onaBeckman Coulter Ac�T diffAnalyzer (Miami, Florida, USA).Plasma vitamin B-12 wasmeasured by microbial assay using acolistin sulphate-resistant strain ofL.leichmanii.[19].Plasma folate wasmeasured bymicrobiological assay using achloramphenicol-resistant strain ofL.casei.[20] Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration wasmeasured byreducing oxidized thi- olswith sodium borohydride followed byconjugation ofthiols with monobromobimane [21].Treatmen tofB12deficiency withoralphysiolog icaldoses inIndian adolescen twome n PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02230 00October 10,2019 3/8 The baseline and post treatment samples were processed separately, within 3months ofsample collection.
Inter—and intra-batch coefficients ofvariation forB-12 folate and homocysteine measurements were all<8%. Weused SUDOSCAN (Impeto Medical, Paris) which isanoninvasive and quick method forassessing dysfunction inthin unmyelinated sympathetic Cnerve fibers supplying thesweat glands.Wehave previously demonstrated itsusefulness inthediagnosis ofperipheral neurop- athy indiabetic patients [22,23].Higher ESC values (Electrochemical Skin Conductance = current/power inmicroSiemens) indicate better nerve function and anESC value of<40μS is taken asdiagnostic ofclinically significant neuropathy (asprovided bythemanufacturer).Lower limbs aremore sensitive tonerve tissue function changes, and hence wemeasured the ESC values inthefeetinthisstudy.Nerve conduction studies were performed antidromically tomeasure sensory nerve conduction velocities inboth sural nerves oflower limb and both median nerves ofupper limb (Nicolet Biomedical EMG/NCS system).
Statistical analysis The outcomes included plasma vitamin B-12 and tHcy concentrations, hemoglobin, mean cor- puscular volume (MCV) and redcelldiameter (RDW). Additional outcomes were clinical peripheral neuropathy measures, SUDOSCAN ESC measurements, and sensory NCV values ofthemedian and sural nerves; allnerve measurements fortheright and leftsides were aver- aged fortheanalysis.Many variables were notnormally distributed and hence non-parametric statistical tests were applied.Data arepresented asmedian and 25th&75thpercentile values.The change inmeasurements from baseline tofollow upwere tested using theWilcoxon paired signed rank test.Results Ofthe690adolescents screened forthePRIYA trial, 117(52women) were found tohave a plasma vitamin B-12 concentration <100 pmol/L.Ofthe52women, 39agreed toresearch measurements and were allocated toreceive either (a)vitamin B-12 only [n=19]or(b)Vita- min B-12 +amultiple micronutrient tablet +milk powder [n=20].
Measurements were available on39women participants atbaseline and for34women at the11month (post-treatment) follow up.Ofthefivewomen notstudied atfollow up,three were pregnant and twodeclined follow upmeasurements. These fivewomen hadcomparable baseline plasma vitamin B-12 concentration (median 93.4 vs93.0 pmol/L) and SUDOSCAN ESC values (75.9 vs76.0μS)compared totherestofthestudy group.The baseline and post treatment values oftheoutcomes were similar inthetwotreatment allocation groups (B-12 vs B-12 +MMN) and hence pooled results arepresented (Table 1).Asagroup, these women were ‘undernourished’ (18women hadabody mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2),31(79%) hadanemia (Hb<12 g/dl) and 13(33%) hadmacrocytosis (MCV >100 fl).Allhadnormal plasma folate concentrations buthigh homocysteine.None ofthe women showed clinical signs ofB-12 deficiency (stomatitis, glossitis, peripheral neuropathy) and theSUDOSCAN ESC values and sensory NCVs were inthenormal range (Table 1).
After 11months oftreatment, there wasasignificant increase inplasma vitamin B-12 con- centrations; only 4stillhadaB-12 level<100 pmol/L. The hemoglobin concentration increased significantly, while theMCV, RDW, and prevalence ofanemia (59%) decreased.Of the13women who were macrocytic atbaseline, twodidnotattend forfollow up,and ofthe remaining 11,theMCV hadfallen to<100fl ineight.There wasasubstantial fallinplasma tHcy concentration, while folate concentrations remained stable.Joint position and vibration Treatmen tofB12deficiency withoralphysiolog icaldoses inIndian adolescen twome n PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02230 00October 10,2019 4/8 sense remained normal inallbutthere wasasignificant increase intheSUDOSCAN ESC and themedian and sural sensory NCV (by14.7%, 16.2% and 29.4% respectively).
Discussion Inthisstudy ofasymptomatic vitamin B-12 deficient adolescent women weobserved asignifi- cant improvement inB-12 concentrations, hematological and biochemical, metabolic parame- tersand peripheral nerve function after 11months oftreatment with anoral B-12 dose of2μg /day. This wasnotaclinical trial, butrather acare protocol, inwhich wedocumented the effects ofaphysiological dose ofB-12 ondifferent parameters inotherwise asymptomatic but clearly B-12 deficient women.Wepiggy-backed these observations onto arandomized con- trolled trial ofB-12, inadolescents byfollowing theB12 deficient women who were excluded from themain trial duetotheethical imperative ofaplacebo controlled trial.The selection of thedose ofB-12 (2μg/day) wasbased ontwoprevious studies inthispopulation inwhich we haddemonstrated adequate absorption oforal B-12 inthemajority, and documented improvement inB-12 status after oral supplementation for1year.
The improvements in hemoglobin, MCV and RDW, homocysteine and peripheral nerve function (even though this wasintheclinically normal range atbaseline) arevery encouraging. The substantial prevalence ofvitamin B-12 deficiency inthispopulation isatleast partly ascribable tovegetarianism due toreligious and socioeconomic factors.The lack ofclinical symptoms (severe anemia, stomati- tisand glossitis, and peripheral neuropathy) isasurprising butcommon observation inour experience.Wedonotknow thereasons forthiswith confidence, butitcould bepartly dueto anadaptation (inapopulation likely tohave been B-12 deficient formany generations) ordue toadequate status oftherelated vitamin folate which might compensate forsome oftheactions ofvitamin B-12.These facts supported ourdecision touseoral B-12 inphysiological doses in thePRIYA trial aswell asinthetreatment ofexcluded women.
Intheonly other community- based intervention inadolescent Indian women, oral vitamin B-12 atamuch higher doseTable 1.Compariso nofclinical ,hematolo gical and nerve function measureme ntsbefore and after 11months oftreatment.

Such large doses arecostly, and areunlikely tobe used inalarge-scale public health intervention inIndia. Other studies from India have been hospital-based and insymptomatic vitamin B-12 deficient patients.They reported animprove- ment innerve conduction [25,26], cerebral blood flow (functional magnetic resonance imag- ing) and white matter microstructural integrity (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) [27–30] after 6–12 months oftreatment with large doses ofparenteral B-12.The strengths ofthisstudy arethat wemeasured theeffects ofa‘pragmatic’ physiological dose ofB-12 and demonstrated significant improvement inseveral important physiological parameters, making thefindings highly policy-relevant.
Limitations include: 1)Wedidnot formally assess compliance with treatment, 2)small sample sizebecause thestudy waspiggy- backed onto anongoing trial 3)absence ofacontrol group reflects theethical imperative of notwithholding treatment inamore severely deficient 4)lack ofactive B-12 and methyl malo- nicacid (MMA) measurements, (specific metabolic markers forB-12 deficiency), duetolim- ited availability offunds. However, intheabsence ofconcomitant changes infolate status, homocysteine concentrations provide important information ontissue (liver) effects ofB12 supplementation, asdemonstrated inourprevious observational and interventional studies [18].Conclusion Inthiscommunity-based study inadolescent rural Indian women with asymptomatic vitamin B-12 deficiency wewere able todemonstrate improvement inhematological and biochemical- metabolic indices, and inperipheral nerve function, after treatment with aphysiological dose oforal vitamin B-12.
Our findings arerelevant topublic health because ofthewidely prevalent lowB-12 status inIndians and thepractical applicability ofourapproach.
