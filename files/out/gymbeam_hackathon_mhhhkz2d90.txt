Whether these results canbegeneralized topeople ofother ancestry groups warrants investigation.

Background The pleasure derived from sweet taste isamajor reason forconsuming toomuch added sugars [1–4]. Because ofthepotential negative health outcomes oftheoverconsumption ofadded sug- ars,leading health agencies recommend reducing itsintake toimprove health [5].Forexam- ple,theAmerican HeartAssociation recommends limiting theintake ofadded sugars tono more than 9teaspoons perdayformen and 6teaspoons perdayforwomen and children [5], incontrast totheaverage of17teaspoons perdayonaverage that Americans consume [6].However, reducing added sugars consumption isnoteasy formany people, and itcanbeeven more challenging forpeople who likesweeter foods and beverages (a.k.a., having a“sweet tooth”).Todevelop successful personalized nutrition strategies toreduce theintake ofadded sugars, there isaneed tobetter understand thefactors that contribute toindividual variations insweet liking.Aperson’s liking forsweetness hasagenetic origin butmay also beinfluenced byenviron- mental factors [7–12].
Human twin studies have found that individual differences insweet taste liking arepartly inherited, with theestimated heritability ranging from 27% to41% ina U.S. cohort [13] and aFinnish cohort [9],respectively.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have further identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within several genes tobeassociated with sweet liking and sweet food intake inastudy ofEuropean ancestry using data from theU.S., Australia, and UKBiobank [7,14].Ontheother hand, studies investigating theeffects ofenvironmental influences, such asrepeated exposure tosweet tastes, have yielded equivocal results [10–12, 15,16].While onestudy found that repeated exposure tosweet taste ininfants lessthan 12months olddidnotlead toincreased sweet liking [12], another clinical trial reported that adults who reduced their sugar-sweetened beverage consumption showed a decreased preference forsweetness after 12months [10].
Overall, both genetics and environ- mental factors should beconsidered tobetter understand how individual sweet liking is formed. Although several SNPs incertain genes have been identified tobeassociated with the human sweet-liking trait inindividuals ofEuropean ancestry [7,9,17–19] [Table 1],whether these genes relate tosweet liking inindividuals ofnon-European ancestry groups isunclear.It isimportant tonote that thefrequencies ofthese trait-increasing alleles arehighly varied across individuals with different ancestry backgrounds.Forexample, according totheNIH dbSNP [20], thefrequencies forthetrait-increasing alleleFGF21 rs838133:A are48% inindividuals of European ancestry intheU.S., 17% inindividuals ofMexican ancestry intheU.S., and 1%ina Southern Han population inChina.The differences inallele frequency could beonereason for theobserved differences insweet liking and added sugars intake across ancestry groups [7,21– 24].
Indeed, data from theCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention indicate that intheU.S., individuals ofAfrican ancestry have thehighest average sugar intake (19teaspoons perday), while individuals ofAsian ancestry have thelowest average sugar intake (10teaspoons per day) [25] among ancestry groups. Alistofthesweet-related genetic variants and their allele frequencies across different populations canbefound inTable 2.Furthermore, thenon-ran- dom associations ofalleles atdifferent loci(i.e., linkage disequilibrium, orLD) also differ by PLOS ONESweet taste liking inAfrican andEast Asian ancestry groups intheU.S.–Astudy protocol PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03000 71April 29,2024 2/20Funding: Thisstudy issupporte dbyaNational Institute ofHealth grant R16GM1504 11(toMMC) andaProfess ional Staff Congress- CityUniversity ofNewYork grant 66366-00 54(toMMC).

Toinvestigate this, some researchers have used added sugars intake asanindicator ofsweetness exposure [12]. One report assessing sugar-sweetened bever- ages (SSB) intake inadults in187countries using data from theGlobalDietaryDatabase showed that SSB intake inAsian countries hasbeen lower than inWestern high-income coun- tries since 1990, whereas SSB intake insub-Saharan Africa waslower butlater increased toa similar level asWestern high-income countries in2015 [45].Theoretically, individuals who were born incountries with alower overall added sugars intake may belesslikely tobe exposed tosweet foods and beverages compared toindividuals who were born incountries with ahigher added sugars intake.Based onthedata from theGlobalDietaryDatabase, wecan assume that most U.S.-born individuals hadagreater level ofsweet taste exposure during early childhood than most individuals who immigrated totheU.S.from non-Western countries.
However, fewstudies have documented dietary changes after migrating totheU.S. [46–51], or how these changes may affect taste liking [52].Immigrants may retain their sweet liking devel- oped intheir home countries, ashasbeen observed with other dietary habits [53–55].There- fore, comparing immigrants vs.U.S.-born individuals ofsimilar ancestry backgrounds may help inform whether environmental differences during early childhood affect sweet-liking status.Overall, weaim tounderstand thegenetic and environmental influences onindividual dif- ferences insweet liking byexamining associations between sweet-related genetic variants and sweet liking.Inparticular, wewilltestthese relationships inindividuals oftwoancestry groups ofpeople intheU.S.who areunderrepresented ingenetic research, theAfrican and East Asian ancestry groups.
Given that most taste and genetics studies were conducted onindividuals of European ancestry [7],wewillinvestigate whether theeffects ofthese sweet-related genetic variants onsweet liking inother populations remain thesame. Wealso aim todetermine the differences insweet liking between U.S.-born individuals and immigrants ofthesame ances- tralbackground because their exposures toadded sugars and sweet taste during early child- hood may bedifferent.Our overall goal istoenrich and expand theunderstanding ofhow genetics and environment affect sweet liking and diet inunderrepresented populations living intheU.S.Methods anddesign Study objectives Objective 1.Determine theallele frequencies and effects ofsweet-related SNPs onsweet liking intwounderrepresented populations–the African and theEast Asian ancestry groups– living intheU.S.

Objective 2.Determine thedifferences insweet liking between individuals who are U.S.-born vs.immigrants within each oftheAfrican and East Asian ancestry groups living in theU.S. Wehypothesize that immigrants willhave alower degree ofsweet liking compared totheir U.S.-born counterparts within thesame ancestry group after adjusting forindividual sweet foods and beverages intake.Ethics approval and consent toparticipate Allstudy procedures areaccording totheethical principles oftheDeclaration ofHelsinki (2013).The study hasbeen approved bytheCity University ofNew York Human Research Protection Program (IRB#: 2023-0064-Brooklyn) .Allparticipants willprovide written, informed consent prior toengaging instudy procedures.Study design Weenroll individuals ofAfrican and East Asian ancestry groups living intheU.S.topartici- pate inthisstudy (see therecruitment andscreening section, below).Participants attend one in-person session and twoat-home sessions.
During thein-person session, wetake anthropo- metric measurements and asaliva sample forDNA extraction. Participants aresent home with twosweet taste testkits, known astheSimpleSweetTest kits, fortheir sweet liking assessment.The participants arealso asked tocomplete aseries ofstudy questionnaires athome.These questionnaires include avalidatedFoodLikingSurvey [56–59] toassess sweet foods and SSB liking,theshortHealthyEatingIndex (sHEI)questionnaire [60] forassessing dietary added sugars intake and diet quality, and other dietary behavior questionnaires administered online using QualtricsTM.Thestudyoutcomes section below describes these procedures indetail.See Fig1foragraphical representation ofthestudy design.Once allthesamples arecollected, theparticipants’ DNA willbeextracted and sent tothe GeneticResources CoreFacility atJohnsHopkinsUniversity ofMedicine tobegenotyped using theGlobalDiversityArray.
Wewillassess theallele frequencies for46SNPs associated with sweet taste sensitivity, sweet liking/preference, and sugar/carbohydrate intake identified through GWAS and other genotype-phenotype association studies [see Table 2]and compare Fig1.Study design flowchart . https://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0300071.g0 01 PLOS ONESweet taste liking inAfrican andEast Asian ancestry groups intheU.S.–Astudy protocol PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03000 71April 29,2024 7/20 thedifference between ancestry groups.Wewillestimate theeffect ofeach SNP onsweet liking using multiple linear regression models foreach ancestry group.Wewilluseancestry-specific SNP effects, generated inourdataset, tocompute polygenic scores intheUKBiobank dataset totestitspredictive validity.
Sample size estimation Studies byKeskitalo etal.[9]and Knaapila etal.[13] estimated theheritability ofsweet liking response (measured byliking ratings forsweet solutions) tobe40.9% inaFinnish cohort and 27% inaU.S. cohort, respectively.Tobeconservative, weassumed thecorrelation between genetic riskand sweet liking tober=0.20, which yielded aneffect sizeslope H1of0.06 accord- ingtoanalyses inG*Power [61, 62].With atype Ierror rate of α=0.05 and atype IIerror rate of β=0.20 (80% power), wepropose torecruit 191participants from each ofthetwoancestry groups, which yields atotal of191x2=382participants forabalanced design.Accounting for amodest 10% drop-out rate, wewillaim torecruit atotal of426participants.Study participants and eligibility criteria Weaim torecruit 426unrelated individuals ofAfrican and East Asian ancestry over theageof 18with normative taste functions ofallbody mass index statuses.
Weexclude individuals who were pregnant orplanning tobecome pregnant, those with ahistory ofallergies tosugar, those without normal senses ofsmell and taste, and those without access totheinternet oradevice that allows them toaccess theinternet. Tocompare potential differences insweet liking between U.S.-born individuals and those who areimmigrants, itisimportant tocode immigration status based onageatimmigration.Wedefine immigrants asthose who immigrated totheU.S.after agefour—a cutoff based on thecompletion ofthecomplementary feeding period [63] when food habit patterns become stable [64].However, theageatwhich sweet liking becomes resistant tochange issomewhat unclear.Toclarify whether ourimmigrant distinction issensitive totheagecutoff used, we willrepeat thecomparison defining immigrants asthose who immigrated after age12(the end ofmiddle childhood [65]) and age19(the end ofadolescence [66]).Recruitment and screening Werecruit men, women, and nonbinary individuals.
Weanticipate a70% female to30% male ratio because ofthesexdifferences inwillingness toparticipate inresearch [67]. Brooklyn, NY isaparticularly appropriate place forthisstudy because ofthediversity (13.6% Asian, 26.7% Black, 35.4% Caucasian, 18.9% Hispanic, and 5.4% ofother) [68] and thelarge number of immigrants residing inBrooklyn (approximately 38% foreign-born individuals).Forindividu- alswho were born outside oftheU.S., weexclude those who moved totheU.S.lessthan four years ofage.Weareaware that recruiting participants from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds for biomedical and clinical studies canbeachallenging task.This isbecause ofvarious barriers such asmistrust ofthemedical community, lack oftransportation, location ofthestudy center, scheduling issues, lowhealth literacy, and stringent exclusion criteria, allofwhich make itdif- ficult torecruit from thispopulation [69–71].
Toovercome these challenges, wehave inten- tionally designed ourrecruitment protocol tominimize these barriers and ensure wecan adequately recruit from thispopulation [72]. The study center, Brooklyn College, isconve- niently located with reliable public transportation tofacilitate easy access forparticipants.There arenostrict exclusion criteria that typically limit theeligibility ofracial and ethnic minority participants based onchronic medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, PLOS ONESweet taste liking inAfrican andEast Asian ancestry groups intheU.S.–Astudy protocol PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03000 71April 29,2024 8/20 Diabetes, obesity, etc.) [69, 71].Various recruitment methods willbeutilized toincrease the reach ofstudy materials [73, 74].Wefirst disseminate ourrecruitment materials near the Brooklyn College campus and surrounding communities, and viasocial media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) toincrease thevisibility ofthestudy.
Wealso reach ourparticipants through professional and personal networking toestablish trust and build relationships with surrounding communities [69, 73,74]. Previous participants arealso encouraged toinvite their eligible friends and colleagues toparticipate inthestudy.Our research team isflexible and available toadapt toparticipants’ schedules and betransparent about thestudy.Study outcomes Sweet taste liking assessment–The SimpleSweetTest.IntheSimpleSweetTest forsweet taste liking assessment, participants taste sucrose solutions atvarying concentrations.Solu- tions areprepared using food-grade sucrose (Fisher Chemical, crystalline/NF, catalog #S3- 500) dissolved indistilled water.Participants first practice using the100-point visual analog scale (VAS) byrating liking forremembered/imagined sensations.After thebrief training, par- ticipants taste, using asip-and-spit protocol, and rate their liking fortwosucrose solutions (0.09 Mand 1.05 M)onthe100-point VAS.
Participants areinstructed torinse their mouths at least twotimes before tasting each sample, with atimer setfora1-minute break between sam- ples. Each concentration istasted twice within thesession, and theentire session isrepeated onaseparate day.Allinstructions areprompted byRedJade (RedJade Sensory Solution LLC, Martinez, CA), aSOC 2Type IIcertified online software designed tocollect sensory data, and iseasy tofollow.TheSimpleSweetTests areconducted attheparticipant’s home.Toensure thefreshness of thesucrose solutions, allsolutions areprepared and used byparticipants within oneweek.We label alltestsolutions with aone-week expiration date and instruct ourparticipants tonotcon- sume anysamples past thisdate.Wealso instruct ourparticipants tostore thesucrose solu- tions intheir refrigerators and only take thesamples outoftherefrigerator onehour before they areready totaste thesample toallow thesamples toreach room temperature.
The twosucrose concentrations from theSimpleSweetTest were chosen based ondata from apreliminary study. Inthepreliminary study, wefirst assessed individual sweet prefer- ence using theMonellForced-Choice PairedComparison Preference Tracking testfrom theNIH ToolboxforAssessment ofNeurological andBehavioral Function [75, 76], during which partici- pants tasted fiveconcentrations ofsucrose (0.09, 0.18, 0.35, 0.70, 1.05 M)dissolved inwater and were asked tochoose their preferred sample inaforced-choice paradigm.Onaseparate occasion, weasked thesame group ofparticipants torate thesame 5sucrose concentrations using a100-point VAS induplicates.The 100-point visual analog scale isthescaling method used intheSimpleSweetTest because itisintuitive and easy touse, akeyadvantage inself- administered taste tests, among other psychometric strengths [77, 78].
Wefound that liking ratings from 2concentrations (0.09 Mand 1.05 M)explained 76% ofthevariance ofthemost preferred concentration identified using theMonellForced-Choice PairedComparison Prefer- enceTracking test[79]. This demonstrated that using only theliking ratings of2sucrose con- centrations, 0.09 Mand 1.05 M,could predict thepreferred concentration with reasonable accuracy [79].The congruency between taste-liking tests inatraditional laboratory setting compared to taste tests conducted athome hasbeen explored inaprevious study [80].The correlation between sweet-liking ratings obtained inthelaboratory vs.athome washigh, with acorrela- tion coefficient ofr=0.86.Furthermore, taste tests forliking conducted athome provide better ecological validity, aspeople typically donotconsume sweet foods orbeverages inalaboratory PLOS ONESweet taste liking inAfrican andEast Asian ancestry groups intheU.S.

Another advantage oftheSimpleSweetTest isthat itonly takes approximately 10min- utes tocomplete, thus lowering participants’ burden and reducing therisk ofsensory fatigue.The entire testisrepeated onaseparate day.The twotestsessions arereplicated sessions to ascertain test-retest reliability using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.Anindividual sweet lik- ingscore iscalculated using theslopes ofthedegree ofliking forthe0.09 Mand 1.05 Msolu- tions.Our pilot data indicates that theSimpleSweetTest hashigh test-retest reliability inboth theAfrican and theEast Asian groups (Pearson’s correlation r=0.81 to0.84, p<0.001) [Fig 2].TheSimpleSweetTest canalso capture awide range ofsweet-liking responses [Fig 3].Over- all,theat-homeSimpleSweetTest isareliable method tocollect high-quality data.Sweet food and beverage liking assessment–The FoodLikingSurvey.
Participants com- plete avalidatedFoodLikingSurvey developed byDuffy etal.[56–59] Aversion ofthissurvey isadministered intheUKBiobank [81]. The modified version oftheFoodLikingSurvey inour study contains 66items (including 6non-food items), divided into food groups based ontheir sensory and nutritional qualities, ona100-point scale anchored with theextremes “hate it” and “love it”from thissurvey [56–59].Out ofthe60foods and beverages, 5items (icecream, cookies/cakes/pastries, sweet confectionaries/candies, jelly/jam/syrup, and chocolate) are grouped into a“sweets” category and 4items (soda/soft drinks, sweetened coffee drinks, energy drinks, and juice/sweet tea/smoothies) aregrouped into a“sugar-sweetened beverages” category.Other food groups include vegetables, fruits, salty/fat, high-fat protein, alcoholic drinks, whole grains/fiber, refined grains/carbs, healthy fat,unhealthy fat,lean protein, and spicy.Alistofthefood groups and food items within each group canbefound inTable 3.

The 22-item sHEI haspreviously been shown tobeareliable proxy foradded sugars and sugar-sweetened beverage intake frequencies [60]. The frequencies ofsugar-sweetened beverages, sugary foods, and added sugars consumption areused tocalculate anestimated daily added sugars intake value ranging from 0to1456 kcals perday.Individual added sugars intake kcals perdayvalues were divided byfour toobtain thedaily added sugars intake perdayingrams.Saliva collection and genotyping.Participants areasked toexpectorate into aDNA col- lection kit,which contains asmall tube with afillline(~2mL) forsaliva samples (Oragene.Dis- covery, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).Weinstruct theparticipants tonoteatordrink anything within 1hour ofproviding thesaliva sample.Saliva samples arestored atCity University of New York, Brooklyn College until analysis at-20˚C.
The samples willbeshipped totheGenetic Resources CoreFacility atJohnsHopkinsUniversity ofMedicine and analyzed using theGlobal DiversityArray, thegold standard inhuman genotyping and used bytheNIHAll-of-Us program. Aside from genotyping forthesweet-related alleles listed inTable 1,wewillalso usethe participants’ genetic information toinfer their ancestry groups based ontheir genetic distance scores toseveral reference populations (e.g., 1000 genome) using theGRAF-pop program [84].The inferred ancestries willbeharmonized with self-identified race/ethnicity.Wewillbeable toconfirm participants’ self-identified ancestry groups using thismethod inthestudy.Based onpreliminary analyses ofrelated research, weexpect self-reported race data tofailtomatch ancestry groups based onGRAPH-pop results forapproximately 2%ofparticipants.Those participants willbeexcluded from themain analyses.This percentage isincorporated into the drop-out rate described above.

Participants also completed afood frequency questionnaire while visiting the assessment centers and afollow-up online 24-hour dietary recall, from thelatter free sugar intake wasestimated from theoverall diet.

The calculations willbeconducted separately forindi- viduals ofAfrican and East Asian ancestries astheresults may differ between ancestry groups. From there, wewillusetheSNPs associated with thesweet liking phenotype from Table 1 and thebeta effect sizes oftheSNPs from tocreate polygenic scores fortheAfrican and East Asian ancestry groups.The polygenic scores willbeweighted based ontheir effect sizes for each ancestry group.ForSNPs inancestry-specific LDofr2>=0.8,only oneSNP willbe included inthecalculation ofpolygenic scores.ForSNPs inancestry-specific LDofr2<0.8 and r2>0.5,wewillfitallSNPs inonemultivariate linear regression model and usethecondi- tional beta effect sizes tocalculate polygenic scores.Wewillalso calculate unweighted poly- genic scores bysumming thenumber ofsweet-liking-increasing alleles.Wewillusethesame scoring method developed using theU.S.

Wewillapply thisscoring method fortheUKBio- bank participants ofAfrican (n=10149) and East Asian (n=8219) ancestries.Sweet food/bev- erage liking information collected using theFoodLikingSurvey intheUKBiobank willbe averaged into asweet food and beverage liking score.Wewillthen determine theassociations between theindividual polygenic scores and sweet food and beverage liking scores forboth ancestry groups within theUKBiobank data set.With asample sizeof8219, wehave 80% power (alpha =0.05) todetect aneffect ifthepolygenic score accounts for>0.12% ofthevari- ance insweet liking scores.ForObjective2,multivariate linear regression analyses willbeconducted todetermine the association between immigration status and sweet liking within each ancestry group.
Wewill compare themean sweet-liking scores between immigrants and non-immigrants using at- test. Wewillfirst regress sweet-liking scores onthecovariates ofageand sexand then take the residuals forcomparison.Then wewillfurther regress sweet liking scores onage, sex,and added sugar intake and take residuals forcomparison toinvestigate theinfluence ofsweet taste exposure onsweet liking.Discussion This study aims toassess theeffects ofgenetics and environment onsweet liking and added sugars intake bystudying individuals from twounderrepresented ancestry groups intheU.S., theAfrican and theEast Asian ancestry groups.Itisimportant topoint outthat thegoal ofthis study istounderstand how individuals differ from oneanother within these groups, butnotto make general assumptions about thegroups.
While studies that investigated theaverage differ- ences insweet liking across ancestry groups provide astarting point foruntangling these rela- tionships [55, 86], itisalso important tounderstand how genetic makeup and previous experiences with foods affect sweet liking within underrepresented communities onanindi- vidual level, similar totheefforts that have been made tounderstand individual differences within European communities [7,13,18]. Forexample, inastudy that explored therelation- ship between variations inTAS2R38, agene that isassociated with bitter sensitivity, and sweet preference within children and mothers ofAfrican and European ancestries living intheU.S.[87], itwasfound thatTAS2R38 isassociated with sweet preference inchildren butnotintheir PLOS ONESweet taste liking inAfrican andEast Asian ancestry groups intheU.S.

Itwasconcluded from thisstudy that cultural forces and experience may contribute toasignificant proportion ofvariance insweet liking thus overrid- ingthegenetic effects observed inchildren [87].Inthecurrent study, weexpand upon these findings [87] toaccount fortheeffects ofmultiple genes that have been associated with sweet- ness perception, intake, and liking intwopopulations that areunderrepresented inscience.Our goal istoprovide amore comprehensive picture ofhow genetics may influence sweet lik- ingand added sugars intake using apolygenic approach.There isalack oflarge-scale genomic data setsdirectly assessing sweet liking asapheno- type.Afewstudies used sugar intake and intensity perception asproxy measures forthesweet liking phenotype [7,19].
Although liking isassociated with consumption [1–3], itdoes not always predict consumption [1,88,89]. Therefore, itispossible that added sugars intake may notbeareliable orappropriate assessment ofindividual liking forsweet tastes.With that in mind, there isaneed tocollect thesweet-liking phenotype using areliable and accessible method.Akeystrength ofthecurrent study isthat weusetheSimpleSweetTest, amethod developed toallow forthecollection oflarge-scale sweet-liking phenotype data.With theSim- pleSweetTest, participants cantake thetestinthecomfort oftheir own homes, anenviron- ment where sweet foods and beverages aremore typically consumed compared tothe traditional laboratory setting.Deploying more tests that canbeconducted athome, such asthe SimpleSweetTest, iscritical toincreasing theaccessibility oftaste and genetic research tomore diverse populations inthefuture.
Weacknowledge that theacculturation ofimmigrants could beapotential confounder for determining theenvironmental effects onsweet liking because itmay affect individual added sugars intake. Therefore, theimmigrant group only includes individuals who moved totheU.S.aged 4years orolder, after thecomplementary feeding period when toddlers were first intro- duced tosolid foods [63, 90].Furthermore, wewilltestwhether individualized added sugars intake isaconfounder and addthisasacovariate inourstatistical models ifappropriate.We also acknowledge that immigrants arefrom many ethnically diverse backgrounds (e.g., East Asians from Japan vs.theHmong people from Laos, Black Jamaican vs.Black Africans).This study isnotpowered toanalyze thedifferences across immigrant groups, butinstead, wefocus onwhether differences exist between U.S.-born individuals and immigrants asafirst step to understanding thiscomplex topic.
Wealso acknowledge that non-nutritive sweetener expo- sure may interfere with study outcomes. Weaim tofocus ontheeffects ofsugars inthisstudy, butwewillattempt toquantify theeffects ofnon-nutritive sweeteners infuture studies.Conclusion There isaneed toconsider individual taste liking when providing culturally appropriate diet recommendations.Inthisstudy, weaim tounderstand what drives sweet liking and added sugars intake inunderrepresented populations.Data from thisstudy willbeastep toward devising personalized nutrition guidance based onindividual taste preferences.Afewstudies arecurrently underway totestwhether sweet liking/preference canbeshifted (ClinicalTrials.govID:NCT04079855, NCT04497974), similar totheshift insaltiness liking after alow-salt diet [91].Our results willaidindeveloping tailored approaches tomodify sweet liking based onindividualized genetic and environmental factors.
The overall goal istoexpand ourknowl- edge oftaste preference genotype-phenotype associations and their interactions with environ- mental factors beyond theEuropean ancestry group toinform research and interventions for allpopulations.
