Effect of spaghetti meat abnormality on broiler chicken breast meat composition and technological quality1 Giulia Tasoniero, Hong Zhuang, Gary R.Gamble and Brian C.Bowker2 USDA, Agricultural Research Service, U.S.National Poultry Research Center, Athens, GA 30605 ABSTRACT The effects of spaghetti meat ( SM) myopathy and sampling location on chicken breast meatphysical traits, composition, and protein functionality were investigated using 30 normal ( N) and 30 SM boneless ﬁllets.Weight, drip loss, pH, and color traits were determined on intact ﬁllets.Proximate composition, water holding capacity, mineral pro ﬁle, SDS-PAGE, myo ﬁbrillar, and sarcoplasmic protein solubility, and emulsifying properties were assessed onboth the super ﬁcial ( S) and deep ( D) layers of the breasts.SM ﬁllets were heavier ( P,0.0001) and exhibited greater drip loss ( P50.0131) and higher b* index on the skin side of the muscle ( P,0.0001).
Muscle condition by layer interaction effect revealed that thesuper ﬁcial portion of SM ﬁllets ( SM-S ) exhibited the highest moisture ( P50.0003) and fat contents (P50.0011) coupled with the lowest protein (P,0.0001) and ash contents ( P50.0458). Total and soluble collagen amounts were higher in N-S and SM-S groups compared with N-D and SM-D ( P,0.0001).SM-S group exhibited the highest calcium ( P50.0035) and sodium ( P,0.0001) levels.Overall, the myopathy had only minor impacts on protein pro ﬁles, while the muscle layer exerted a more remarkable effect.SM ﬁllets exhibited higher pH but a lower myo ﬁbrillar protein solubility ( P,0.0001).Salt-induced water uptake, cooking loss, and ﬁnal yield values suggested a potential impairment of water-holding capacity in SM-affectedmeat.Sarcoplasmic and myo ﬁbrillar emulsion activity indexes were similar between the 2 muscle conditions,but the stability of the emulsions was lower in SM meat.
Overall, signi ﬁcant layer and muscle condition by layer effects were not observed in the functional properties of the breast meat. SM exerted a profound and negativeimpact on breast meat composition that led to detri-mental consequences on functionality traits.Given thefundamental role of protein quality for meat processing,these data suggest that a further step toward the un-derstanding of this myopathy should be the investigation of intrinsic protein characteristics.Key words: chicken breast, spaghetti meat, proximate composition, protein functionality 2020 Poultry Science 99:1724 –1733 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.069 INTRODUCTION Spaghetti meat ( SM) is an emerging muscular abnor- mality affecting broiler chicken Pectoralis major muscle, whose onset and morphological characteristics were ﬁrst described by Bilgili in 2015.
Distinguishing macroscopictraits of affected breasts include the overall impairedmuscle integrity and a stringy, soft consistency of theventral-cranial portion of the Pectoralis major because of the poor cohesion of the muscular ﬁber bundles. The altered histological features, which are primarilyobserved on the super ﬁcial layer of the ﬁllet, partly over- lap those of white striping and wooden breast, respec-tively, described by Kuttappan et al.(2013) andSihvo et al.(2014) ; extensive myodegeneration coupled with regeneration, loss of the normal tissue architecture, ne-crosis and lysis of ﬁbers, adipose tissue in ﬁltration, in- ﬂammatory cells in ﬁltration, and edema.However, a peculiar trait of SM not detected in other emerging my-opathies is a progressive rarefaction of the endomysialand perimysial connective tissue that compromises theﬁber bundles cohesion, coupled with a loose connective tissue deposition ( Baldi et al., 2018 ).
Accordingly, Bilgili (2015) speculated that the impaired muscle struc- tural integrity was ascribable to the immaturity of this newly deposited collagen. As the visual acceptability of affected meat is compromised, processors either discard/C2112019 Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-NDlicense ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Received August 20, 2019.Received in revised form October 22, 2019.Accepted October 24, 2019.1The use of trade, ﬁrm, or corporation names in this publication is for the information and convenience of the reader.Such use does not consti-tute an of ﬁcial endorsement or approval by the United States Depart- ment of Agriculture or the Agricultural Research Service of any product or service to the exclusion of others that may be suitable.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impact of this myopathyon breast meat quality and the suitability of SM ﬁllets to be included in the formulation of meat products.Tothis respect, the ﬁrst studies available ( Baldi et al.2018; 2019 ) indicated poor meat quality traits in affected ﬁllets, with the impairment observed mainly on the super ﬁcial portion of the muscle.Given the limited data available on SM and the importance of this issue for the poultry meat sector, the objective ofthe present study was to investigate in greater detailthe effects of the SM myopathy on chicken breast meatcomposition and functionality attributes.
Thus, aspectsnot yet evaluated were assessed (mineral pro ﬁle, salt- induced water uptake, cook loss, ﬁnal yield, myo ﬁbrillar and sarcoplasmic protein solubility, and emulsifying properties) to provide additional insights into breast ﬁllet properties that may in ﬂuence quality and process- ing traits. The effect of measurement location was alsoconsidered, as SM lesions distribution displayed intra ﬁl- let variations ( Baldi et al., 2018 ).MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Collection and Preparation A total of 60 skinless boneless breast ﬁllets ( Pectoralis major ) were obtained from a commercial broiler process- ing plant during 2 sampling repetitions; each time, 15spaghetti meat ( SM) affected and 15 unaffected (normal, N) samples were collected 3 h postmortem, packed in resealable bags on ice and transported to the U.S.
National Poultry Research Center (Athens, GA).The selected SM samples exhibited a mushy and stringyconsistency, because of muscle ﬁber bundle separation, especially in the ventral-cranial portion of the ﬁllets (Bilgili, 2015; Baldi et al., 2018 ). Breasts exhibiting the white striping and/or wooden breast conditions wereexcluded from selection in this study.At 6 to 8 h postmortem, ﬁllets were trimmed, weighed, and L*a*b* color values ( CIE 1976 ) were measured on the cranial, medial, and caudal portions of both skin andbone sides of the Pectoralis major muscles with a Konica Minolta CM-700d spectrophotometer (Konica Minolta,Ramsey, NJ).The color values reported for each siderepresent an average of the 3 measurements.To quantifythe drip loss according to the method of Honikel (1998) , all intact ﬁllets were suspended in sealable, water- impermeable plastic bags, stored overnight at 4 /C14C, and reweighed at 24 h postmortem.
After drip loss determi-nation, ultimate pH was measured in the super ﬁcial and deep layers of the cranial end of the Pectoralis major muscles with a Hach H160 portable pH-meter (Love-land, CO) equipped with a spear-tipped probe and cali-brated through the two-point calibration method. Thereafter, the caudal portions of the ﬁllets were removed, and the cranial-middle portions were horizon-tally split into super ﬁcial ( S) and deep ( D) layers ofequal thickness.All 4 types of samples (N-S, N-D, SM- S, and SM-D) from each ﬁllet were then individually chopped in a food processor.Breast Meat Composition Proximate Composition Five samples per group per repetition were used for proximate composition andmineral pro ﬁle analysis.Moisture and fat were deter- mined in duplicate on fresh samples at 24 h postmortem using a rapid microwave moisture analyzer and a NMRfat analyzer (CEM Smart ProFat 6 and Oracle systems,CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC).
The remaining por-tions of the chopped samples were then frozen at280 /C14C, freeze-dried, and utilized for total ash quanti- ﬁcation ( AOAC 1990 ) and mineral pro ﬁle analysis. Protein content was calculated by difference, based on the proportion of moisture, fat, and total ash in the sample.Mineral Pro ﬁleFor each sample, pellets (60 mg) were prepared from lyophilized powder using a 13.0 mm diam-eter stainless-steel die (Pike Technologies, Madison, WI)and compressing the pellets to 10 mPa using a labora-tory press (Columbia International, Irmo, SC).Theresultant pellets were analyzed for Na, K, Ca, and Mg contents through the laser-induced breakdown spec- troscopy, using a RT100-HP laser-induced breakdownspectrometer (Applied Spectra, Fremont, CA).Plasmawas induced using a Nd:YAG laser with ,5 ms pulses at the fourth harmonic (266 nm) and a repetition rate of2 Hz.Pulse energy was 24 mJ focused onto a 100 mm spot size.
A gate delay of 0.2 ms was followed by acquisition of the emitted light in a 1.0 ms window, allowing for minimization of background continuum radiation, while retaining suitable signal from atomic emission lines.Emitted light was collected with a Czerny-Turnermonochromator coupled with an intensi ﬁed charge- coupled detector, allowing simultaneous detection ofall atomic emission lines. Spectral acquisition was per-formed in an air atmosphere.Each sample spectrum wasaveraged over 50 shots and obtained by moving the sample in a raster pattern that was 1 mm !1 mm.A total of 10 spectra were obtained from different locationson each pellet.
All spectra were normalized to the C lineat 247.9 nm, and the resultant peak heights of Mg(279.6 nm), Ca (422.7 nm), Na (589.0 nm), and K(766.5 nm) were obtained.Collagen Content Five samples per group per repeti- tion were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into pow- der for the determination of soluble and insoluble collagen content according to the procedure describedbyHill (1966) with modi ﬁcations. Quadruplicate 3 g meat samples were added to 16 mL of ¼strength Ringers solution, heated at 77 /C14C for 70 min in a water bath, centrifuged 10 min at room temperature at 3,600 rpm,and decanted through Whatman 09-795 paper ﬁlter.For each sample, 2 aliquots were designated for soluble collagen determination: residues were added to 8 mL of ¼strength Ringers solution, centrifuged at the same conditions, and added to 25 mL of concentrated HCl.SPAGHETTI MEAT DEFECT AND BREAST MEAT QUALITY 1725 For the insoluble collagen determination, meat residues were added to 25 mL of 6 N HCl.
Both soluble and insoluble sample solutions were autoclaved for 18 h at 121/C14C, 18 –20 psi, their pH adjusted to 6.00, diluted respectively to 250 and 500 mL and ﬁltered through Whatman 09-795 paper ﬁlter. Spectrophotometric determination of collagen was carried out according tothe procedures of Bergman and Loxley (1963) andCross et al.(1973) .Thus, 2 mL of isopropanol, 1 mL of an oxidant solution (7% w/v chloramine T, 1 volume, and acetate/citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 3 volumes), and 4 mL of Ehrlich ’s reagent were pipetted to each sample.Tubes were incubated at 60 /C14C for 25 min and cooled.
Spec- trophotometric determination of the hydroxyprolinecontent was carried out at 558 nm using a Jasco V-630spectrophotometer (Jasco, Easton, MD); the followingequations were used to convert mg of hydroxyproline/mL of solution to mg of collagen/g of meat: ½ðmg=mlÞ!dilution factor !constant /C138=sample wt !10005mg collagen =g of meat With 250 and 500 used as dilution factors and 7.52 and 7.25 used as constants for soluble and insolublecollagen, respectively. Total soluble was reported asthe sum of the soluble and insoluble collagen contents.Protein Composition and Functionality Five samples per group per repetition were utilized to determine muscle protein pro ﬁles and functionality at- tributes.
SDS-PAGE, solubility, and emulsifying proper-ties were determined on meat stored under vacuum at 220 /C14C, while water holding capacity traits (salt-induced water uptake, cook loss, and ﬁnal yield) were assessed on fresh meat.Protein Isolation and SDS-PAGE AnalysisSarcoplasmic and myo ﬁbrillar protein fractions were iso- lated from 2 g of chopped meat according to the proced-ures of Pietrzak et al. (1997) .A biuret assay was performed to determine the protein concentration of the 2 fractions.Samples were diluted to 2 mg/mL in sample buffer (8 mol urea, 2 mol thiourea, 3% SDS (wt/vol),75 mmol DTT, 25 mmol Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.004%bromophenol blue) and denatured for 3 min in boilingwater.
Denatured protein samples (15 mg protein/lane) and a broad range molecular weight standard (5 to250 kDa, Thermo Scienti ﬁc PageRuler Broad Range Unstained Protein Ladders, Waltham, MA) were loaded onto Novex precast 4 –20% tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and ran at4 /C14C at a constant voltage. Gradient gels (4 –20%) were utilized to allow for a broader range of proteins to beanalyzed, and equal protein loads ensured that differ-ences were because of actual variations in the proteinproﬁles.Gels were then stained (Coomassie brilliant blue R-250) and destained.The densities of 13 sarcoplasmic and 17 myo ﬁbrillar protein bands were quanti ﬁed by Alpha View software (v 3.4, ProteinSimple Inc., SantaClara, CA); the relative abundance of each individualprotein band was expressed as a percentage of the total protein abundance of all bands in the lane.
Water Holding Capacity Traits Salt-induced water uptake and pellet cook loss were determined at 48 h post-mortem on triplicate 5 g samples of freshly minced meat,according to the procedures of Bowker and Zhuang (2016) . Meat was weighed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes along with 7.5 mL of cold 0.6 mol NaCl buffer.Tubeswere vortexed for 30 s, stored at 4 /C14C for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 3,000 !gfor 15 min at 4/C14C.The resulting supernatant was discarded, and salt-induced water up- take was computed according to the formula: ½100!ðswollen pellet wt /C0initial meat sample wt Þ =initial meat sample wt /C138 Subsequently, tubes were put in an 80/C14C water bath for 20 min.
Liquid was then removed, and cook lossand ﬁnal yield were determined according to the following formulas, respectively: ½100!ðswollen pellet wt /C0cooked pellet wt Þ =swollen pellet wt /C138 ½100!ðcooked pellet wt =initial meat sample wt Þ/C138 Protein Solubility Protein solubility was measured following the procedures of Bowker and Zhuang (2016) . For sarcoplasmic protein solubility, triplicate 1 g meat samples were added with 10 mL of cold 25 mmolpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and homogenizedfor 10 s at 18,000 rpm with a VWR AHS 250 homoge-nizer (VWR International, Radnor, PA).Tubes werethen vortexed and centrifuged at 2,600 !gfor 30 min at 4 /C14C.The extract was ﬁltered through 4 layers of cheesecloth, and its protein concentration was measuredusing a biuret assay with a BSA standard curve.Using asimilar procedure, total protein solubility was measuredwith 0.55 mol KI, 0.05 mol potassium phosphate buffer(pH 7.2).
Myo ﬁbrillar solubility was calculated as the difference between total and sarcoplasmic proteinsolubility. Emulsion Activity Index and Emulsion Stability In- dex Sarcoplasmic and myo ﬁbrillar emulsion activity in- dex ( EAI) and emulsion stability index ( ESI) were assessed on 2 g of meat per sample, according to themethod of Chan et al.(2011) as modi ﬁedBowker and Zhuang (2016) .Meat was homogenized 3 !30 s at 18,000 rpm in 40 mL of cold 25 mmol potassium phos-phate buffer (pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 15,250 !gfor 15 min at 4 /C14C.The supernatant was ﬁltered through Whatman no.1 ﬁlter paper and collected as the sarco- plasmic protein fraction.The remaining pellet was ho-mogenized in 40 mL of 0.55 mol KI, 0.05 mol potassiumphosphate buffer (pH 7.2), centrifuged, and ﬁltered at the same conditions previously described to obtain themyoﬁbrillar proteins fraction.Protein concentrations were measured with a biuret assay using a BSA standardTASONIERO ET AL.1726 curve.
Aliquots of the extracts were adjusted to 2.0 mg/ mL with their respective buffers to a ﬁnal volume of 3.6 mL. The obtained solutions were mixed with corn oil in a 3:1 volume ratio and homogenized at 14,000 rpm for1 min.Immediately, triplicate emulsion aliquots of 35 mL were diluted to 3.5 mL in 0.1% SDS buffer; emulsionturbidity absorbance was read immediately after prep-aration (A 0) and after 10 min (A 10) at 500 nm on a Genesys 10S UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Sci-entiﬁc).EAI and ESI were then calculated according to the equations of Selmane et al.(2008) : EAI52:33!A 0 ESI510!½A0=ðA02A10Þ/C138 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using a mixed model (PROC MIXED) of SAS (version 9.3, SAS Insti-tute Inc., Cary, NC).A one-way ANOVA was used toevaluate the effects of muscle condition (M: N and SM)on weight, color, and drip loss, with sampling repetition included as a random effect.
A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze pH, composition, and protein function-ality traits. Muscle condition, layer (L: S and D) andtheir interaction M !L were included as ﬁxed effects and sampling repetition and breast sample included asrandom effects.SDS-PAGE data were analyzed usingthe same two-way ANOVA mixed model, with the inclu-sion of gel among the random effects.Means were sepa- rated using Bonferroni adjustments; P,0.05 was assigned as signi ﬁcance level.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physical Traits Breast weight, drip loss percentage, and color traits are reported in Table 1 .In accordance with the previous study of Baldi et al.(2018) ,ﬁllets affected by the SM myopathy were heavier ( P,0.0001) than unaffected ﬁl- lets.Affected ﬁllets displayed a greater drip loss(P50.0131) than normal ones.
This phenomenon could be attributed to the compromised structural integrity of the muscle tissue observed with the SM condition, as well as to the edema of the interstitium associated with theother histological lesions. The results obtained for colortraits indicated that neither breast lightness (L*) norredness (a*) were impacted by the pathological condi-tion.Differently, the b* values measured on the skinside of SM ﬁllets were higher than those detected on the corresponding side of the N ﬁllets ( P,0.0001).In addition, even though the discrepancies were not signi ﬁ- cant between the 2 muscle conditions, the bone surface ofaffected ﬁllets was tendentially more yellow than its un- affected counterpart ( P50.0668).Increased yellowness corroborates the histological observation of Baldi et al.(2018) , who found adipose tissue accumulation among muscle ﬁbers occurring in SM insulted ﬁllets.
As fat possess a yellowish color, it might have directly contrib- uted to the increased b* values ( Dalle Zotte et al., 2017 ). Breast Meat Composition The effects of the SM myopathy on breast meat composition ( Table 2 ) were not uniform throughout thePectoralis major muscle.Signi ﬁcant muscle condi- tion by layer interaction effects were observed for mois- ture, protein, fat, and ash content.Consistent with themacroscopic characteristics of the ﬁllets, the effects of the SM on muscle composition were more profound inthe super ﬁcial portion of the muscle.In normal ﬁllets, the proximate composition was similar between the su-perﬁcial and deep layers of the muscle.In SM ﬁllets, how- ever, the super ﬁcial portion of the muscle was signiﬁcantly different than the deep portion.Proximate composition was similar between the deep layers ofnormal and SM ﬁllets.
However, the super ﬁcial portion of SM ﬁllets exhibited greater moisture ( P50.0003) and fat contents ( P50.0011) and lower protein (P,0.0001) and ash contents ( P50.0458) than the su- perﬁcial portions of normal ﬁllets. This impairment in meat composition is consistent with histological traits, such as tissue myodegeneration, necrosis and lysis of cells, poor ﬁbers uniformity, and fat deposition, observed in SM ﬁllets, which are similar to those reported for white striping ( Kuttappan et al., 2013; Ferreira et al., 2014; Radaelli et al., 2017; Baldiet al., 2018 ) and wooden breast ( Sihvo et al., 2014, 2017; de Brot et al., 2016; Soglia et al., 2016a; Radaelliet al., 2017 ).
The reduced protein content in SM ﬁllets may potentially be because of the greater myo ﬁbrillar protein degradation that is observed with thestructural breakdown of muscle ﬁbers resulting from tissue degenerative processes ( Harris et al., 2003 ) and increased enzyme ef ﬂux because of a compromised sarco- lemma integrity ( Mitchell, 1999; Sandercock and Mitchell, 2003 ). The greater moisture content detected in SM samples might re ﬂect a reduction of the myowater fraction retained within the myo ﬁbrillar matrix.This phenomenon, ascribable to changes inmuscle microstructure and structural proteins intrinsicTable 1.Breast weight, drip loss, ﬁllet skin, and bone sides color traits according to muscle condition (M - normal, N vs.spaghetti meat, SM).

Table 2 also displays the total and soluble collagen con- tent in normal and SM ﬁllets.Interestingly, the lack of sig- niﬁcance observed for the muscle condition effect indicated that SM and normal breast muscles possessedsimilar amounts of total and soluble collagen.
Musclelayer, on the contrary, had a remarkable effect on thesetraits. The super ﬁcial portion of both normal and SM ﬁl- lets displayed greater levels of total (S 55.13 mg vs.D54.36 mg; P,0.0001) and soluble collagen (S51.34 mg vs.D 51.09 mg; P,0.0001) than their deep counterparts.Despite the endomysial and perimysialconnective tissue rarefaction that has been histologicallyobserved in SM ﬁllets ( Baldi et al., 2018 ), neither the cur- rent nor previous data ( B a l d ie ta l .,2 0 1 8 ,2 0 1 9 )f o u n d differences in total collagen with the SM myopathy.Additionally, it emerged that soluble collagen content did not differ between affected and unaffected ﬁllets.This ﬁnding seems to be in contrast with a lower content of hydroxylysylpyridinoline, a non-reduciblecross-link of muscular collagen, observed in the super ﬁcial portion of SM breasts by Baldi et al.(2019) .Overall, the muscle composition data in the current study con ﬁrms the previous ﬁndings of Baldi et al.
(2018; 2019) , who also indicated an altered proximate composition in SM ﬁllets, as well as a strong sampling position effect. Interestingly, the current results seemto suggest that even breast ﬁllets that do not exhibit the SM condition also possess uneven collagendistribution throughout the muscle.Mineral Pro ﬁle The emission line intensities of magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium were discriminated based on their relative proportions and their peak height values were reported in Table 3 .Overall mineral pro ﬁle differ- ences because of the SM myopathy were more pro-nounced in the super ﬁcial portion of the muscle.Like the proximate composition, the Ca 21(P50.035) and Na1(P,0.0001) levels in the tissue exhibited signi ﬁ- cant muscle condition by layer interaction effects.Thegreatest emission intensities for Ca 21and Na1were observed in the SM-S samples, whereas SM-D and the 2 normal groups exhibited similar intensities for theseminerals.
No differences were detected in Mg 1levels. A muscle layer effect was observed for K1levels (S520.4 vs.D 519.8; P50.0272).Sandercock and Mitchell (2003; 2004) andSandercock et al.(2009) inves- tigated the role of an altered cation regulation on thepathogenesis of skeletal muscle damage in broiler chickens.These authors hypothesized that a greater so- dium level in the muscle was a triggering factor for theimbalanced Ca 21intake into the muscle ﬁbers, which in turn was responsible for the altered cell membraneintegrity through the activation of Ca 21-dependent pro- teases and lipases.To date, SM etiology is still obscure,and the possible participation of defective cation regula-tion as a pathological mechanism needs further investi- gation.A connection between cation homeostasis disturbances and cell injury development has alreadybeen suggested for other emerging myopathies(Mutryn et al., 2015; Petracci et al., 2015; Soglia et al., 2016a; Tasoniero et al., 2017 ).Table 2.

Thirteen electrophoretic protein bands were quanti ﬁed in the sarcoplasmic fraction, consisting primarily of glycolytic enzymes ( Figure 1 andTable 4 ). Differences in the sarcoplasmic protein pro ﬁles were mi- nor, which suggests that the SM myopathy does notcause a large shift in the metabolic pro ﬁle of the muscle.Layer exerted a stronger in ﬂuence on the sarcoplasmic protein pro ﬁle than muscle condition ( Table 4 ).The su- perﬁcial portions of the ﬁllets had a greater relative abun- dance of a band corresponding to 158 kDa ( P,0.05), while the deep portions exhibited a greater abundanceof proteins corresponding to 110 kDa and23 kDa ( P,0.05).It is possible that high molecular weight bands ( .150 kDa) found in the sarcoplasmic pro- tein fraction of the muscle are breakdown products of larger structural proteins indicating increased postmor- tem proteolysis.However, further work is needed toconﬁrm this hypothesis.
An unknown 67 kDa proteinband exhibited a signi ﬁcant ( P,0.01) muscle condition by layer interaction. The abundance of this protein wasgreater in the super ﬁcial layer than the deep layer in SMﬁllets (SM-S 1.78% vs.SM-D 1.26%, P,0.001).In normal ﬁllets, however, the abundance of the 67 kDa was similar between the super ﬁcial and deep layers (N- S 1.17% vs.N-D 1.00%, P.0.05).Seventeen electropho- retic protein bands were quanti ﬁed in the myo ﬁbrillar fraction, consisting primarily of contractile and cytoskel-etal proteins ( Figure 2 andTable 5 ).Like the sarco- plasmic protein fractions, differences in myo ﬁbrillar protein compositions were minor with muscle layer hav- ing a greater impact than the SM condition.In bothnormal and SM ﬁllets, the protein band corresponding to nebulin was less abundant in the super ﬁcial layer (P,0.01), whereas a 28 –30 kDa band was more abun- dant in the super ﬁcial layer ( P,0.001).
These observa- tions could suggest that more extensive postmortemproteolysis occurs in the super ﬁcial layers of both normal and SM ﬁllets than in the deep layers. The relative abun- dance of an 80 kDa protein band was greater in normalﬁllets compared with SM ﬁllets.Signi ﬁcant interaction effects were observed for the bands corresponding to a- actinin and MLC-3.In SM ﬁllets, the relative abundance of the a-actinin was less in the super ﬁcial layer compared with the deep layer (SM-S 2.32% vs.SM-D 2.63%,P,0.05).However, in normal ﬁllets the abundance of the a-actinin band was similar between the layers (N-S 2.62% vs.N-D 2.51%, P.0.05).It is well established that the myodegeneration associated with white striping Figure 1.Representative SDS-PAGE protein pro ﬁles of the sarco- plasmic fractions from the super ﬁcial (S) and deep (D) layers of normal (N) and spaghetti meat (SM) broiler breast ﬁllets.MW, molecular weight marker (kDa).Figure 2.

The minor, yet signi ﬁcant, differ- ences observed in the electrophoretic protein pro ﬁles suggest that further research to elucidate the SM effects on inherent properties of the muscle proteins (i.e., de-grees of oxidation, denaturation, and degradation) iswarranted.Breast Meat Functionality The results obtained for pH and protein functionality traits are reported in Table 6 . Similar to wooden breast and white striping, ﬁllets affected by the SM condition exhibited a higher pH ( P,0.0001) than the unaffected ﬁllets.Previously, metabolomic studies conducted on wooden breast ( Abasht et al., 2016; Zambonelli et al., 2016) and white striping ( Alnahhas et al., 2016 ) indi- cated that a reduced muscle glycogen content as well as an altered glucose metabolism might explain thealtered pH observed in ﬁllets affected by those myopa- thies.As the metabolic features of SM have not beeninvestigated yet, future research should elucidate theTable 4.

Because most of the water in muscle tissue is typi-cally held within the myo ﬁbrillar structure, with fewer myoﬁbrils (as suggested by less muscle protein) there is simply a lower potential for the muscle to bind water.On the other hand, a poorer water retention ability could also be explained by diminished muscle protein function- ality due to inherent structural or chemical changeswithin the proteins themselves. Protein solubility wasdeﬁned by Xiong (2004) as the amount of protein that dissolves into an aqueous solution under speci ﬁc extrac- tion conditions.As solubility re ﬂects the equilibrium be- tween protein and water, it is a useful indicator of meatprotein functionality.In this study the SM myopathy reduced ( P,0.0001) myo ﬁbrillar protein solubility (Table 6 ).
The impact of the SM myopathy on sarco- plasmic protein solubility was not statistically signi ﬁ- cant; however, sarcoplasmic protein solubility waslower in the super ﬁcial layers of the muscles compared to the deep layers ( P,0.0001). Decreased protein solu- bility is often attributed to protein denaturation andassociated with decreased meat water-holding capacity and meat functionality.However, Baldi et al.(2019) re- ported that protein denaturation patterns for normaland SM ﬁllets analyzed with differential scanning calo- rimetry were similar.This would suggest that thereduced protein solubility measured in the current studymay be predominantly a function of reduced muscle pro-tein in the tissue.Adjusting protein solubility values forinitial muscle protein content, however, did not fully ac- count for reduced protein solubility in SM ﬁllets.The ability of protein to form a stable emulsion can also be used as an indicator of protein functionality.
Inthis study, the emulsifying properties of myo ﬁbrillar and sarcoplasmic protein extracts were assessed throughthe determination of the emulsion activity index ( EAI) and emulsion stability index ( ESI). The EAI measures the ability of proteins to rapidly adsorb at the fat- water interface during emulsion formation due to their hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups ( Xiong 2004; Chan et al., 2011 ).The ESI re ﬂects the degree of fat globules stabilization reached through both protein-protein and protein-fat interactions ( Barbut, 1995 )b y measuring the rate of emulsion destabilization overtime ( Chan et al., 2011 ).It was observed that normal and SM ﬁllets exhibited similar EAI values for both the sarcoplasmic and myo ﬁbrillar protein extracts.With regards to the ESI, there was a signi ﬁcant muscle condition by layer interaction effect with the least stablemyoﬁbrillar protein emulsion produced by the SM-S group (SM-S 514.6; SM-D 516.1; N-D 515.8; N-S517.4; P50.0052).
The stability of the emulsions formed by the sarcoplasmic protein extracts were lower(P50.0243) in SM ﬁllets compared to normal ﬁllets. Because the protein extracts in this study were adjusted to similar concentrations prior to measuring the EAI andESI, changes in these values due to the SM myopathywere attributed directly to changes in the intrinsic prop-erties of the proteins rather than the reduced proteincontent of the muscle.CONCLUSIONS As breast meat with the SM condition is likely destined for use in further processed meat products, itis vital to understand the impact of the myopathy onmeat composition and functionality.The ﬁndings of the current study demonstrated that the SM condition negatively impacted breast meat proximate composi- tion, particularly with regards to protein content.Asthe super ﬁcial layer of affected ﬁllets was characterizedTable 6.

It was also demon-strated that the SM myopathy impaired meatfunctionality traits: altered pH, potentially decreasedwater holding capacity, inferior protein solubility, andemulsion stability.Overall, data suggested that thereduction in muscle protein content was likely the causeof reduced meat functionality.However, minor shifts in the muscle protein pro ﬁles of SM ﬁllets and alterations in protein solubility and emulsi ﬁcation properties sug- gest that the effects of the myopathy on the integrityand intrinsic properties of muscle proteins (i.e., degreeof denaturation, degradation, and oxidation) meritsfurther investigation because of the importance ofmeat protein quality for processed products.
