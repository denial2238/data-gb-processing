Abstract: Cationic dendritic amphiphiles were prepared through the linkage of interesting hydropho- bic molecules such as cholesterol or vitamin E to the focal point of carbosilane dendrons. These new dendritic systems self-assembled in saline, producing micellar aggregates with hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 6.5 to 9.2 nm, and critical micelle concentrations of approximately 5 and 10µMfor second- and third-generation systems, respectively.The assemblies were able to encap- sulate drugs of different charges (anionic, neutral, and cationic).Surprisingly, a 92% encapsulation efﬁciency for diclofenac was achieved in micelles prepared from second-generation dendrons.
Toxic- ity measurements on peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated different behavior depending on the generation, corresponding to the micellar regime. In contrast to the third-generation system, the second-generation system was non-toxic up to 20 µM, opening a window for its use in a micellar regimen, thereby operating as a drug delivery system for different biomedical applications.Keywords: carbosilane; dendron; cholesterol; tocopherol; micelle; drug encapsulation 1.Introduction Classical surfactants are substances formed using a hydrocarbon chain attached to an ionic polar group.Of these, the oldest used are fatty acids which are biomolecules that make up the main components of fats and consist of a carboxylic acid group attached to a hydrocarbon chain that can be of different lengths and degrees of saturation.However, other naturally occurring compounds are able to form amphiphilic systems, and, therefore, its aggregates are cholesterol and vitamin E.
Cholesterol is an essential steroid lipid in the cytoplasmic membrane, where it fulﬁlls a very important structural function, giving rise to the ﬁnal physical–chemical properties of the membrane. In addition, it is involved in biosynthetic hormone processes, such as those of testosterone and progesterone, as well as vitamin D.In the ﬁeld of micellar aggregates, Haberland and Reynolds demonstrated in the 1970s that cholesterol was an amphiphilic molecule capable of forming micelles at concentrations in the order of nanomolars [ 1].Therefore, in recent years, many amphiphilic structures derived from Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451.https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040451 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451 2 of 19 cholesterol have emerged by modifying its polar zone to improve its solubility and offer new features depending on the desired application (gene therapy, drug encapsulation, antitumor therapy, etc.) [ 2–4].
In addition, in the last decade, so-called quatsomes have been developed, where cholesterol plays a fundamental role in helping other surfactants to form more complex systems [ 5]. In particular, cholesterol interacts with the hydrocarbon tail of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) through hydrophobic interactions.This interaction causes the non-covalent association of the two molecules to behave as a single unit, resulting in geometry changes from conical to cylindrical and favoring the formation of vesicles.Therefore, the addition of different proportions of cholesterol causes a change from classical spherical micelles of CTAB to vesicles.Although the number of amphiphilic systems that contain cholesterol is extensive, there are only a few examples of its use to generate classic amphiphilic head/tail dendritic systems.
For instance, bis-MPA dendrons were reported, which were capable of micelle formation at c.a.5µM with diameters of approximately 7 and 15 nm for a second-generation system, depending on whether they had one or two cholesterol groups at the focal point (tail), respectively [ 6–8]. Another example involved poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)-type dendrons, with a critical micellar concentration (CMC) of 20 µM, and micelle diameters of about 115–130 nm [ 9,10].In both cases, the dendritic skeletons had relatively hydrophilic characteristics, and the studies were focused on the delivery of nucleic acids with cationic micelles.In both cases, interaction with DNA occurred, which allowed these systems to be used as gene therapy carriers.Vitamin E is a generic term that includes a total of eight biologically active compounds with similar functions.
All of these compounds contain a chromanol ring and differ in their degree of methylation of the aromatic ring and in the saturation of the side chain, giving rise to the derivatives α-,β-,γ- and∆-tocopherol and -tocotrienol. These molecules, encompassed under the name vitamin E, are the most abundant liposoluble antioxidants in cells, and their main function is to break the chain of reactions that gives rise to the oxidation of lipids [ 11,12].Among them, α-tocopherol has the greatest bioavailability and activity.Numerous scientiﬁc studies in which d- α-tocopherol was used in the synthesis of amphiphilic molecules, as a lipophilic component for the generation of micelles, have been reported [ 13–16].These amphiphilic systems almost always presented poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the hydrophilic unit [ 17–20].Another example was that formed with inulin polysaccharide as a hydrophilic part [ 21].
These systems with CMCs between 3 and 75 µM were able to successfully encapsulate curcumin and celecoxib with efﬁciencies of 37 and 52%, respectively. Regarding its use in dendritic systems, d- α-tocopherol covalently linked to the periph- ery of PAMAM dendrons was reported for different biomedical applications [ 22–24].In the speciﬁc ﬁeld of dendritic micelles, d- α-tocopherol as a hydrophobic component, was bound to the periphery of poly-lysine type hydrophilic dendrons with PEG at the focal point [ 25,26].These dendrons had CMCs between 1.3 and 1.5 µM, and their micelles diam- eters ranged from 10 to 20 nm.In addition, these micelles were able to encapsulate proteins for biomolecular transport applications.However, no amphiphilic dendrons have been reported in the literature with the classical head/tail structure where the periphery of the dendron served as the hydrophilic head group, and the tail composed of a d- α-tocopherol molecule was attached to the focal point.
In general terms, dendritic micelles have been shown to exhibit advantages compared to those composed of conventional surfactants. For instance, they can exhibit better stability in solution and lower CMCs, in addition to their multivalency that allows enhanced interactions with biological systems compared to individual small molecules [ 27–30].In this sense, we have recently reported the design of new amphiphilic carbosilane dendrons with pH-dependent behavior based on the presence of carboxylate groups at the periphery and a fatty acid in the focal point to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [ 31].Here, we present our results concerning the formation of carbosilane dendritic micelles using cholesterol or vitamin E (d- α-tocopherol) as the hydrophobic tail at the focal point Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451 3 of 19 of the dendritic scaffold and hydrophilic ammonium groups at the periphery, along with their viability for drug encapsulation.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.

Both the micellar solution and the non- encapsulated diclofenac were analyzed using HPLC. The drug encapsulation efﬁciency was calculated using the following equation: Encapsulation Efﬁciency (EE,%) = Weight of loaded drug/Weight of drug initially added ×100 In vitro release proﬁle .In vitro release of diclofenac from the diclofenac-loaded micelles ( 5+ diclofenac) was studied using the dialysis bag method.Brieﬂy, 1 mL of drug-micelle solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH = 7.4) was placed in a regenerated cellulose dialysis bag (MWCO: 1 kDa), which was incubated in 250 mL of PBS at 37◦C.At predetermined time points, 100 µL of the dialysis bag was taken with buffer replacement to maintain the constant volume.The samples were analyzed using HPLC.A control experiment to determine the release of the free drug in 1 mL of acetonitrile-water (1:3) was also carried out as described above.2.4.Biological Experiments Viability studies.

The assays were carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were treated at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 50µM of the cationic dendron families and grown in PRMI medium supplemented with 10% of FBS.The cells were plated in a p96 multiwell plate and exposed to dendrons at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 50 µM for 48 hours.Cells were treated after incubation with 0.5 mg/mL of MTT for 2 h, and crystals were dissolved in DMSO.Absorbance was measured at 570/690 nm, and viability was expressed relative to untreated cells.DMSO was used as a death control and untreated cells as the cell viability control.Data are presented as mean ±SD of three single experiments performed in triplicate .GraphPad software Prism v.5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for the statistical analysis of the results.Data with three replicates are displayed as bars ±SD.

Synthesis of Amphiphilic Dendrons Amphiphilic dendrons with different functional groups at their peripheries and fo- cal points were prepared using protocols developed in our research group for analogous dendritic systems [ 32]. Hydrophobic molecules with self-assembly inducing capabili- ties, including cholesterol or d- α-tocopherol, were incorporated at the focal points.Then, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions were used to functionalize the dendrimer periph- eries with hydrophilic trimethylammonium groups which would exhibit cationic charge regardless of the pH.Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451 7 of 19 3.1.1.Cationic Dendrons with Cholesterol at the Focal Point The conjugation of the cholesterol molecule at the focal point using a carbamate link- age was performed by employing a chloroformate derivative of cholesterol (Scheme 1).
The reactions with the chloroformate were carried out using primary amine-containing dendrons NH 2Gn(SNMe 2)m(n = 1, m = 2 ( i); n = 2, m = 4 ( ii); n = 3, m = 8 ( iii)), pre- viously prepared in good yields, following Gabriel and thiol-ene reactions [ 32]. After a typical extraction workup, the desired cholesterol-modiﬁed dendrons ChG n(NMe 2)m (n = 1, m = 2 ( 1); n = 2, m = 4 ( 2); n = 3, m = 8 ( 3)) were obtained as colorless oils with good yields (70–80%).The reactions were monitored using1H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure S1) where signals at 3.13 ppm corresponding to the methylene group attached to the nitrogen atom, conﬁrmed bond formation.In addition, resonances attributed to the cholesterol fragment were observed at 5.34 ppm (-C=CH-) and 4.47 ppm (-CH(O)-).The peak corre- sponding to the proton in the carbamate N-H appeared at 4.59 ppm but exhibited slight concentration-dependent shifting.

After a typical extraction workup, the desired cholesterol-modi ﬁed dendrons ChG n(NMe 2)m (n = 1, m = 2 (1); n = 2, m = 4 (2); n = 3, m = 8 (3)) were obtained as colorless oils with good yields (70%- 80%). The reactions were monitored using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure S1) where sig- nals at 3.13 ppm corresponding to the methylene group attached to the nitrogen atom, conﬁrmed bond formation.In addition, resonances attributed to the cholesterol fragment were observed at 5.34 ppm (-C=CH-) and 4.47 ppm (-CH(O)-).The peak corresponding to the proton in the carbamate N-H appeared at 4.59 ppm but exhibited slight concentration- dependent shifting.In the 13C-NMR spectrum (Figure S2), the resonances ascribed to the same units were observed at 40.6 ppm (-CH 2N-), 74.1 ppm (-CH(O)-), and 139.7 and 122.3 ppm (-C=CH-).In addition, the characteristic signal of the carbonyl group was seen at 155.9 ppm.
Finally, the preparation of ammonium-terminated dendrons was achieved through the reaction of 1–3 with an excess of MeI in dry THF (Scheme 1). Amphiphilic dendrons with cholesterol at the focal point ChG n(NMe 3I)m (n = 1, m = 2 (4); n = 2, m = 4 (5); n = 3, m = 8 (6)) were obtained as yellow solids with excellent yield (>90%).1H-NMR spectroscopic evaluation supported the correct formation of the desired compounds based on the visu- alization of the deshielding eﬀect observed for moieties adjacent to the nitrogen atom (Fig- ure S3).After the reaction, the resonances appeared at 2.78, 3.02, and 3.66 ppm for meth- ylene groups in -SiCH 2CH2S-, -SCH2CH 2N-, and -SCH 2CH2N-, respectively.In addition, the methyl unit was observed at 3.23 ppm as a singlet.

In the 1H-NMR spectra, the disappearance of the resonance corresponding to the hydroxyl group in free d-α-tocopherol and the shift- ing of the peak corresponding to the adjacent methylene group up to 3.64 ppm conﬁrmed the conjugation (Figure S5). In addition, the chemical shifts of the peaks corresponding to the methyl groups on the aromatic ring of d-α-tocopherol were aﬀected by the ether bond formation, appearing at 2.09, 2.13, and 2.17 ppm.In the 13C-NMR spectra (Figure S6), the most characteristic signals corresponded to the methylene group in the dendron (72.6 ppm) and the aromatic carbon atom (148.2 ppm) of d-α-tocopherol, both of which were directly bonded to the oxygen atom of the ether, and were consequently deshielded.The next step was the functionalization of the peripheral vinyl groups of the den- drons via click chemistry (Scheme 2).

The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of amphiphilic compounds was evaluated for second- and third-generation am- monium-containing dendrons (5–6 and 17–18) using surface tension measurements. Due to the ionic charge of the dendrons, CMC is strongly aﬀected by the presence of salts in the medium (see Figure S12).Salt addition decreases the repulsive electrostatic forces be- tween headgroups and favors micelle formation.Without salt addition, data showed that no micelle formation took place below 10 mM dendron concentration.Due to the potential biomedical applications of these systems, we were interested in systems with the lowest eﬀective concentrations.In prior reports with carbosilane dendrons having palmitic Scheme 2.Synthesis of ammonium-terminated dendrons with d- α-tocopherol at the focal point.Then, to prepare the corresponding quaternary ammonium-functionalized dendrons, neutralization, and subsequent quaternization of -NMe 2·HCl moieties were necessary.

Due to the potential biomedical applications of these systems, we were interested in systems with the lowest effective concentrations. In prior reports with carbosilane dendrons having palmitic groups at the focal point, 20 mM NaCl was found to be the optimal salt concentration to achieve self-assembly [ 33].Because the Cl-ion could exchange with I-counterion from the dendrons and interfere with the micelle formation, NaI in the same proportions was also used and evaluated to study the possible inﬂuence of counterion exchange in the aggregation process.The results indicated a higher surface tension reduction in the presence of NaI than NaCl and slightly lower surface tension with 40 mM of salt than at 20 mM of salt (Table S1).CMC measurements were performed at increasing dendron concentrations in aqueous NaI solution (40 mM) at 30◦C.Figure 3 displays the surface tension curves obtained for each dendron.

[33].Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451 11 of 19 CMC values slightly depend on the generation of the dendron but not on the focal point group.The second-generation dendrons had about two-fold-lower CMC values, implying that the second-generation dendron had a balance between lipophilicity (dendritic skeleton + tail) and hydrophilicity (number of ionic charges) that was more favorable for micelle formation.
This behavior agrees with cationic bis-MPA dendrons modiﬁed with cholesterol (2.9–13 µM) [7,8] or cationic polylysine dendrons functionalized with tocopherol (1.3–15 µM) [25,26]. However, this observation is the opposite to that found for analogous cationic carbosilane dendrons with fatty acids (palmitic or hexanoic groups) at the focal point (see Table 1) [ 33].The latter different proﬁle can be attributed to the importance of a hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HBL) in the micelle formation process of amphiphilic systems.The Gibbs adsorption equation suitable for dilute ideal solutions can be considered for ionic micelles with an excess of salt.From the surface excess ( Γ), approximate values for the area per molecule of dendrons at the air/water interface (A) can be obtained.ΓCMC=−1 RT∂γ ∂lnC(1) A=1 NΓ(2) Results derived from Expressions 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1.
As expected, all dendrons presented positive surface excess which reﬂects their preference to stay at the water/air interface instead of in the solution matrix, as expected for amphiphilic molecules. The area per molecule of dendron at the surface (A) ranged from 0.54 to 0.67 nm2and is signiﬁcantly lower than those found for analogous carbosilane dendrons with palmitic groups at the focal point [ 33].Similar values were determined for conventional surfactants such as dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (0.56 nm2per molecule).In our case, the ionic head groups are larger in number and more charged, but we should keep in mind the presence of an excess of electrolytes.It is clear from the values in Table 1 that dendron molecules in this region of surface saturation are closely packed, with an orientation perpendicular to the surface.This fact could be explained by a more compact arrangement in the surface creating a highly dense particle compared to their palmitic analogous.
Considering that the cationic head groups are the same, the cholesterol and vitamin E at the focal points favor the closest packing of head groups. The spontaneity of the micellar aggregation process was conﬁrmed through Gibbs free energy calculations ( ∆G0mic) based on Expression 3, in which the correction factor iwas set up as 1 due to the saturation of the stern layer derived from the high salt concentration employed in the experiment.Table 1 shows negative ∆G0micvalues and more favorable processes in second-generation compounds, which agrees with their lower CMC data.∆micG0=iRTlnXCMC (3) Hydrodynamic diameters were estimated using DLS for cationic micelles formed in saline.In the absence of drugs, the size distributions (see Figure S14) conﬁrmed the aggregate formation.Hydrodynamic diameter values showed a decreasing tendency with their generation, contrary to the CMC trend (Table 1).
These results can be explained through the dendron-tail model in which the amphiphilic balance between the dendron (polar head) and the non-polar tail, cholesterol or vitamin E in this work, controls the aggregation process. In this approach, larger polar head groups drive the formation of smaller micelles composed of fewer amphiphilic molecules.In any case, the diameters estimated using DLS are calculated considering spherical micelles.However, the values obtained are too high to be considered as spherical geometries and ﬁt better with cylindrical micelles.The presence of NaI effectively screens the repulsive charges between the micelles, but potentially may also affect their aggregate structures.The reduction in effective head group area due to the screening of the electrostatic repulsion results in the increase in the Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451 12 of 19 packing geometry and the growth of cylindrical micelles.
These shapes were described in our previous studies for cationic micelles prepared from carbosilane dendrons containing fatty acids at the focal point [ 34]. The polar head is made up of a hydrophobic carbosilane scaffold and hydrophilic terminal groups (-NMe 3I).Consequently, the growth from G2 to G3 dendrons not only increases the hydrophobicity (skeleton) but also the hydrophilicity (number of peripheral functional groups) explaining the smaller size obtained for the highest-generation compounds.3.3.Drug Encapsulation Drug encapsulations were performed for hydrophilic drugs including ibuprofen sodium salt, lidocaine, and procaine, as well as for the hydrophobic drug diclofenac.Only dendrons 5and 17were selected for these experiments based on their lowest CMC values.Both dendrons were able to load all of the drugs, although the protocols used depended on the nature of the drugs.
The encapsulation of aqueous-soluble drugs was determined through the modiﬁcation of their absorbance in the presence of increasing concentrations of dendrons (0.5–50 µM). For all molecules, the absorption spectra showed an increase in the drug absorbance as the dendron concentration increased (see Figure S13).This behavior indicates the association of drug molecules with dendron micelles, although drugs can be incorporated in various ways in micelles: they may locate (i) inside the hydrophobic core of the micelles, (ii) be adsorbed on the surface of micelles, or (iii), in the case of drugs with polar and non-polar regions, they may be in the polar portion between the hydrophilic peripheral groups of dendrons and the non-polar region towards the micelle core.For hydrophilic drugs such as procaine hydrochloride or hydrochlorothiazide, it is well known that a bathochromic shift is observed when transferring from water to a less polar region such as in micelles [ 35,36].
The absorption maxima were found at wavelengths of 272, 270, and 290 nm for ibuprofen, lidocaine, and procaine, respectively. However, no bathochromic shifts were observed.Although these behaviors suggest that the drugs were adsorbed on the micellar surface, inclusion inside of the micelle cannot be ruled out because these dendritic micelles include rather large amounts of water, disrupting the hydrophobic core [ 34].The representation of absorbances at these wavelengths versus dendron concentrations showed absorbance increases for dendron concentrations below the CMC values of the corresponding dendrons (Figure 4) and suggesting that drugs affect the CMC values.Pharmaceutics 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 19 group area due to the screening of the electrostatic repulsion results in the increase in the packing geometry and the growth of cylindrical micelles.

The logK values obtained were 6.7 and 7.4 for 5 and 17, respectively.

It is noteworthy that in all cases reported in the literature, diclofenac sodium salt was used.The neutral form used here is more hydrophobic, which may result in higher aﬃnity for the internal micellar domain than its ionic analogue, resulting in higher eﬃciencies.Diclofenac loading did not modify the hydrodynamic diameters of the micelles for cholesterol-modi ﬁed dendrons while it slightly increased the diameters observed for tocopherol-modi ﬁed dendrons (Table 2).The stabilities in the solution of the micellar systems loaded with diclofenac were also evaluated.

Peripheral quaternary ammonium moieties were selected as the hydrophilic components of the structure and the effects of the different structures on the micellization process were examined. Second- and third-generation dendrons formed micelles, and this micellization process was favored by salt addition.Different concentrations (20 mM and 40 mM) and salt types (NaCl and NaI) were assayed, establishing the optimal conditions for aggregate formation in 40 mM NaI.The larger iodide anion (I−) probably produces a favorable stabilization of repulsion forces between peripheral ammonium groups.CMC values reﬂected a generation dependence of self-assembly, with values of approximately 5 and 10 µM for the second and third gener- ations, respectively, and with a negligible focal point effect.
Thermodynamic parameter calculations conﬁrmed the surfactant nature of the dendritic systems and the spontaneity of the micellar process through positive values of surface excess ( Γ) and negative Gibbs free energy ( ∆G0mic). According to the lowest CMC values found for second-generation amphiphiles, ∆G0miccorroborated that the micellization is energetically more favorable.Hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs were satisfactorily loaded in micelles using different methods.The protocol employed for water-soluble drugs showed their encapsulation.This phenomenon was attributed to the reduction in CMC in the presence of the drug, which in turn resulted in a more favorable aggregation process.Partition constant (K) calculations were relevant only for procaine and showed a better encapsulation efﬁciency for the d- α-tocopherol modiﬁed dendron ( 17) than the cholesterol-based analogue ( 5).
Regarding hydrophobic drugs, a very high diclofenac encapsulation was achieved with both cholesterol- and vitamin E-modiﬁed dendrons. The encapsulation efﬁciency of 92% found for diclofenac was the best described in the literature so far.In addition, DLS mea- surements revealed micelle size modiﬁcation in the presence of hydrophilic drugs but none or very minimal change in the case of the hydrophobic ones.The toxicity of the amphiphilic systems was measured on PBMCs, showing that, unlike the third-generation system, the second-generation system was not toxic until 20 µM, which is above their CMC values, Pharmaceutics 2024 ,16, 451 17 of 19 opening a window for their use in a micellar regimen where they can operate as drug delivery systems for different biomedical applications.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040451/s1, Table S1.
