Observational Study Periorbital melanosis and its possible association with insulin resistanceand vitamin D deficiency:A pilot case-control study Sara I.T aha1, Lamyaa Salem1, Rasha Mohamad Hassan2, Mahy El-Bassiouny3, Marwa Hamdy4and Marwa Adham El-Mohamdy1 Abstract Objective: T o investigate the possible association of periorbital melanosis (POM) with insulin resistance (IR) and vitamin D serum levels.Methods: In this pilot, case-control study, we included 100 adult patients with POM and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects.Vitamin D levels and IR indices (i.e., homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholester- ol (TG/HDL-c) ratio, adiponectin/leptin (A/L) ratio) were compared between cases and controls.Results: Compared with controls, POM cases had significantly higher values of HOMA-IR and TG/HDL-c ratio, and significantly lower values of A/L and vitamin D.
HOMA-IR and TG/HDL-c ratio were statistically significantly positively correlated with POM severity while Vitamin D andA/L ratio were statistically significantly negatively correlated. Conclusion: POM was associated with indices of IR and vitamin D deficiency.However, the exact causal link among POM, IR, and vitamin D needs to be established.However, the results ofthis pilot study suggest that POM may have potential as a cutaneous non-invasive marker of these metabolic disorders which would assist in detecting and treating them at an early stage.

Keywords Insulin resistance, Periorbital melanosis, Skin pigmentation, Vitamin D Date received: 5 February 2024; accepted: 24 June 2024 Introduction Skin can serve as a window to a patient’s overall health and its changes can occasion- ally indicate underlying disorders.1 Periorbital melanosis (POM) is a common benign skin condition that can affect men and women of any age and is characterized by bilateral skin hyperpigmentation thatcan be periorbital or infraorbital. 2POM can occur as a primary disorder indepen- dent of any systemic or local illness and in these cases is described as idiopathic cuta- neous hyperchromia of the orbital region(ICHOR).
3It can also occur secondary to genetic, constitutional, inflammatory, aller- gic, or vascular factors.4The degree of pig- mentation changes with tiredness, menstrual cycle, and other physical and emotional stressors.5 Insulin resistance (IR) is defined as an insufficient insulin response combined with impaired glucose uptake by target tis- sues (i.e., skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, and liver), that results in hyperinsulinemia,hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidae- mia, visceral obesity, and endothelial dys- function. 6,7Several skin disorders such as, acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, and acne, have been linked with IR because hyperinsu- linemia is associated with elevated levels of leptin, testosterone, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3); thesehormones play an important role in control- ling gene expression essential for skin cell proliferation.
8,9Using cutaneous indicators as a marker of IR would certainly be a convenient, easier, and faster way of identi- fying the disorder than using standard IR indices such as homeostatic modelassessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),4 triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein choles- terol (TG/HDL-c) ratio,10or the adiponec- tin/leptin (A/L) ratio.11 Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hor- mone synthesized in the skin by a photo- chemical reaction caused by exposure tothe sun’s ultraviolet B (UVB) wavelength. 12 It is responsible for calcium homeostasis as well as bone and mineral metabolism.13,14 Age, pigmented skin, use of sunscreen and clothes inhibit vitamin D production.15,16 Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to sev-eral conditions, including IR, cancer, and obesity.17,18Importantly, several studies suggest that skin pigmentation is associatedwith low vitamin D levels.
19 The purpose of this study was to inves- tigate the possible association of POM withthree IR indices (i.e., HOMA-IR, TG/ HDL-c ratio, and A/L ratio) and vitamin D serum levels in a sample of Egyptianpatients with POM and compare the resultswith matched control subjects. Our aim wasto discover a convenient and fast indicator for insulin status and vitamin D deficiency.Methodology Subjects This pilot, case-control study was per- formed at Ain Shams University Hospital,Cairo, Egypt.A randomly selected sampleof 100 adult patients with POM wererecruited from the Dermatology Clinic at the hospital.A further 100 age- and sex- matched healthy control subjects were iden-tified from the relatives of the patientsattending the clinic.Subjects with overt2 Journal of International Medical Research diabetes or those using glucose-lowering med- ications or vitamin D supplementation were excluded from the study.
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee(FMASU R327/2023), Faculty of Medicine,A i nS h a m sU n i v e r s i t y ,C a i r o ,E g y p t .A l l patients provided written informed consent. All data were collected and retained anony-mously.The reporting of this study conformsto STROBE guidelines.20 Clinical evaluation Detailed medical history was recorded foreach participant, including age, family his-tory of POM, history of allergy or atopy,anaemia, endocrine disorders, refraction error, eyestrain, and associated habits or lifestyle.POM diagnosis was made by adermatologist [M.E.] and depended on thepresence of bilateral periorbital round orsemi-round homogenous brown pigmenta- tion and skin discoloration compared with other facial skin areas.An eyelid stretch testconfirmed POM diagnosis and excludedskin laxity and subdermal vascularity, and a gaze test excluded periorbital oedema.
2,21 POM severity was determined by compari- son with the surrounding skin and gradedinto five categories as follows: 0, no colourchange from the rest of the face; I, faint pigmentation in the infraorbital fold; II, more pronounced pigmentation; III, deepdark pigmentation of all eyelid skin; IV,deep dark pigmentation beyond the infraor- bital fold. 2,22The dermatologist also evalu- ated pigmentation in other areas of the face,such as presence of acanthosis nigricans.23 Other clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI),24systolic and dia- stolic blood pressure (BP),25and waist/hip ratio (WHR),24were also recorded.Laboratory investigations All laboratory investigations were per- formed at the Central Laboratories ofAin Shams University Hospital according to standard methods.Following a 12 hour-fast, all participants had 5 ml venous bloodwithdrawn every morning at the same timeinto a serum separation vacutainer undercomplete aseptic conditions.
Blood wasallowed to clot completely before beingcentrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 minutes. Separated sera were used immediately to measure the lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol,triglycerides, and HDL-c), and fasting bloodglucose (FBG) using AU680 BeckmanCoulter autoanalyzer (Beckman Coulter,Inc., Brea, CA).Sera were stored at /C080 /C14C until further analysis.Of the following: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentra- tions using a COBAS e411 electrochemi- luminescence autoanalyzer (RocheDiagnostics, Switzerland), according tothe manufacturer’s protocol.The detec-tion limit was 4 ng/ml.Fasting insulin levels in sera using a human enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) kit (Cusabio, Houston,USA; CAT no.: CSB-E05069h) with adetection range of 10 mU/ml–160 mU/ml and a sensitivity of 2 mU/ml.

Low ratios indicate IR.11 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed usingSPSS software (version 25.0 for Windows VR; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). A P-value <0.5 was considered to indicate statistical significance.Continuous variables werepresented as means /C6SD and categorical variables were reported as numbers and per- centages.Student’s t test was used to com-pare continuous variables and categoricalvariables were analysed using v 2tests.Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate the possible relationship betweenPOM severity and four variables (i.e., IRindices [HOMA-IR; TG/HDL-c ratio; A/L ratio] and vitamin D levels).To investigate the possible predictors of POM severity, theaforementioned four variables were included in univariate and multivariate Cox propor- tional hazards regression analysis.Theresults were presented as odds ratio (OR)and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
To find the most sensitive and specific cut-offs for discrimination of POM grade I from the grades II-IV, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used tocalculate area under the curve (AUC)values to assess the predictive ability of HOMA-IR, A/L ratio, TG/HDL-c ratio and vitamin D, for grade I. Cutoff pointswere calculated by obtaining the bestYouden index (sensitivity þspecificity /C01).In addition, a multi-ROC was created to assess the efficacy of combined predictionof POM severity using A/L ratio (1.45)and Vitamin D levels (12 ng/ml).Results In total, 100 adult patients with POM and100 healthy control subjects were includedin the study.Details of the participants’characteristics are shown in Table 1.Overall, there were 112 (52%) women and88 (44%) men but there was no significantdifference in the female-to-male ratiobetween POM cases and controls.Therewas also no difference between POM casesand controls in mean age (i.e., 39.6 /C610.7 vs 38.6/C610.7 years).
By contrast with control subjects, POM cases had statistically signif-icantly higher values for BMI, WHR,systolic and diastolic BP, fasting insulin,total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-c, andleptin. Although there was no differencebetween groups in FBG, compared withcontrols, POM cases had statistically signif-icantly higher values of HOMA-IR, andTG/HDL-c ratio than controls ( P<0.001).However, A/L ratio, vitamin D, HDL-c and adiponectin levels were statistically signifi- cantly lower in the POM cases comparedwith controls ( P<0.001).Most POM cases (65%) were of grade II severity (Figure 1).The next most common severity grade was grade I (26%), followedby grade IV (5%) and grade III (4%).Themost commonly conditions noted in thePOM cases were: positive family history ofPOM (78%); history of anaemia (52%);stress or anxiety (39%); inadequate sleep(39%); smoking (38%).We also noticedpigmentation in other face areas in 14%cases and acanthosis nigricans in 12%cases (Table 2).
Vitamin D (r: /C00.745; P<0.001) and A/L ratio (r: /C00.635; P<0.001) were statis- tically significantly negatively correlatedwith POM severity while HOMA-IR(r: 0.431; P<0.001) and TG/HDL-c ratio (r: 0.363; P<0.001) were statistically signif- icantly positively correlated (Figure 2). Multivariate regression analysis showed that only vitamin D serum level was a4 Journal of International Medical Research statistically significant ( P¼0.007) indepen- dent risk factor for POM severity with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.99 and 95% CIs 1.46– 10.89 (Table 3).A diagnostic validity test showed that the highest efficacies were for A/L ratio and vitamin D (95% and 90%, respectively).The multi-ROC of their com- bination (i.e., A/L ratio 1.45 and vitamin D 12 ng/ml) gave a final efficacy of 98%, a diagnostic sensitivity of 95%, a diagnosticspecificity of 95%, a negative predictive value of 82% and a positive predictive value 99% (Figure 3).
Discussion POM is a prevalent cosmetic dermatologi-cal condition and a complex disorder which is thought to occur as a consequence ofseveral factors including genetic, lifestyle and medical. 28Its use as a cutaneous marker of IR is uncertain.IR is considered an early subclinical stage in the progression of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.Identifying people with IR using an easy, rapid, and non-invasive indicator such as a cutaneous marker, will undoubtedly facili- tate early intervention and prevention of dia-betes and metabolic syndrome.4Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate if an association between POM severity and three IR indices (i.e., HOMA-IR, TG/HDL-c ratio, and A/L ratio) existed.In addition, we investigated the possible interaction between POM severity and vitamin D levels.For this study we used 100 patients with POM and 100 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects.Table 1.Participants’ characteristics.

In addition, our POMpatients had higher BMI, BP, WHR, totalcholesterol LDL-c, fasting insulin, FBGand leptin levels, than the matched control subjects. These results are similar to those from a previous study, also in 100 POMpatients and 100 healthy matched controls,that reported serum levels of leptin, FBG,fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and A/L ratiowere higher in POM patients than in controls.It has been suggested that POM is a proinflammatory disorder linked to post-inflammatory conditions such as atopic and allergic contact dermatitis.2Interestingly, several studies have linked IR to inflamma-tion; proinflammatory cytokines can disruptinsulin signalling in target tissues, decreasing glucose uptake and utilization in response to normal insulin levels resulting in compen-satory hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycaemiaas well as metabolic syndrome.6,7,32–34 Previously, studies have linked increasedlevels of leptin to both BMI and IR; leptin Figure 1.

19,39 Another explanation for the decreased vita-min D levels among our POM patients isthat they had a higher BMI and WHR than controls. Vitamin D is fat-soluble and easily retained in adipose tissue, sug-gesting that it may be sequestered in excess body fat in obese people.40To our knowledge, there are no previous studiesinvestigating vitamin D levels and their sig- nificance in POM cases.However, we iden- tified various publications that linkedvitamin D with other skin pigmentation dis- orders, such as, acanthosis nigricans and vitiligo.41,42We found that vitamin D serum levels and the A/L ratio were the best predictors of POM severity; their com- bination in a multi-ROC raised the diag-nostic efficacy to 98%.The study had several limitations includ- ing its single-centre design and a relativelysmall sample size.
In addition, although we observed associations among the parame- ters, we did not establish a causal link.Future controlled investigations involving a large, multicentre population are required to confirm out results. In conclusion, our study showed that POM, IR, and vitamin D deficiency were strongly associated.However, vitamin Ddeﬁciency is thought to be involved in sev- eral cardiometabolic disorders, including IR and diabetes.43–49Therefore, the exact causal link among POM, IR, and vitamin D needs to be established.However, the results of this pilot study suggest thatPOM may have potential as a cutaneous non-invasive marker of these metabolic Figure 2.Correlation of three insulin resistance (IR) indices (i.e., homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], adiponectin/leptin ratio [A/L ratio], triglycerides high density lipo- protein cholesterol (TG/HDL-c) and vitamin Dwith POM severity (n ¼100).
