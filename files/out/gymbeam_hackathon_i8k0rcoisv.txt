Recognizing the gravity of this situation and the enor- mous and devastating impact of sepsis, the World Health Organization has designated sepsis as a global health priority.4,5 Early identification and intervention, including early diagnosis,administrationofantimicrobialtherapy,hemo- dynamic support, and fluid resuscitation, are crucial for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock, and these inter- ventions significantly influence patient prognosis.6Addi- tionally, underlying conditions at the time of sepsis diag- nosis inevitably affect the prognosis, such as electrolyte imbalance.
Magnesium,rankingasthesecondmostplentifulintra- cellular cation, is indispensable for enzymatic reactions involved in protein synthesis, energy metabolism, and DNA synthesis.7In clinical and epidemiological studies, serum magnesium could be served as an accessible and cost-effective biomarker, reflecting magnesium status in humans.8,9Notably, magnesium has been linked to var- ious chronic and inflammatory diseases or conditions.10 For instance, hypomagnesemia has been implicated in increasing risks and adverse outcomes among patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and stroke.11–14 Critically ill patients often exhibit hypomagnesemia,15 and low levels of serum magnesium were correlated with greater severe conditions and mortality of ICU patients.16–19Additionally,elevatedserummagnesiumlev- els have been correlated to increased mortality in crit- ically ill children, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients,andhospitalizedindividuals.20,21However,there isadearthofstudiesinvestigatingtherelationshipbetween serummagnesiumlevelsattheonsetofsepsisandmortal- ityinpatients.Furthermore,itremainsunknownwhether this association exhibits heterogeneous due to different ethnicities.
Therefore, our study aimed to assess the relationship betweenserummagnesiumlevelsattheonsetofsepsisand mortalityratesutilizingdatafromboththeAmericanMed- ical Information Mart in Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) cohortandtheChineseinstitutionalcohort. 2RESULTS A total of 9099 patients were enrolled from Ameri- can MIMIC-IV cohort, while the Chinese institutional cohort comprised 1727 patients (Figure 1).Patients in both cohorts were divided into five groups, categorized by the serum magnesium quintiles from the MIMIC-IV dataset (MIMIC-IV cohort: Q1–Q5; institutional cohort: G1–G5).2.1Baselinecharacteristicsof participants The median serum magnesium level was 0.86 mmol/L [interquartile range (IQR): 0.82–0.99] (Table 1) in the MIMIC-IVcohortand0.87mmol/L(IQR:0.76–1.01;Table S1) in the institutional cohort.Participants with higher magnesiumlevels(Q4–Q5,G4–G5groups)inbothcohorts exhibited higher disease severity scores and worse labo- ratory parameters.
However, patients with sepsis in the MIMIC-IV cohort exhibited a higher prevalence of com- plications, while the institutional cohort demonstrated a moresevereillnessprofile,asevidencedbyhighersequen- tialorganfailureassessment(SOFA)scoreandworsevital signs(Table S2). 2.2Primaryoutcome In the American MIMIC-IV cohort, 2010 patients in total (22.1%)experienced28-daymortality,withthehighestmor- tality observed in quintile 5, comprising 391 cases (27.8%; Table1).Similarly, in the Chinese institutional cohort, there were 276 cases (16.0%) of 28-day mortality, with the highest mortality observed in group 5, consisting of 75 cases(20.0%).Bothcohortsshowedsignificantlyelevated serum magnesium in the nonsurvivor group relative to the survivor group (MIMIC-IV cohort: 0.91 mmol/L vs.0.86mmol/L, p<0.001;institutionalcohort:0.92mmol/L vs.0.87mmol/L, p=0.004).
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis results for the two cohortswithin28daysarepresentedinFigure 2.Boththe two cohorts displayed significant divergence in survival probabilities for the five patient groups (both p<0.05). In the American MIMIC-IV cohort, the highest survival ratewasexhibitedinQ1,whilethelowestsurvivalratewas observedinQ5.However,inChineseinstitutionalcohort, thehighestsurvivalratewasobservedinG2andG3,while theG4andG5hadsimilarlowestsurvivalrates.Univariatelogisticregressionanalysisfortheriskof28- dayall-causemortalityinthetwocohortswereshowedin FigureS1.Inbothcohorts,elevatedserummagnesiumlev- els were found to be considerably linked with increased 28-day all-cause mortality risk [MIMIC-IV cohort: odds ratio (OR) =1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53–2.55, p<0.001;Chineseinstitutionalcohort:OR =2.00,95%CI: 1.16–3.46,p=0.013].
Based on the findings of the univariate logistic regres- sion analysis and considering relevant prognostic vari- ablesobtainedfromclinicalexperience,themultivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. The findings, presented in Table S3for the MIMIC-IV cohort and LIetal.3of13 FIGURE 1 (A,B)Detailedprocessofdataextraction.DetailedprocessofdataextractionoftheMedicalInformationMartforIntensive Care-IV(MIMIC-IV)cohort(A)andtheinstitutionalcohort(B).ICU,intensivecareunit.TableS4fortheChineseinstitutionalcohort,revealedthat patientsinthehigherserummagnesiumgroups(MIMIC- IV cohort: Q4, Q5; Chinese institutional cohort: G4, G5) exhibited a noticeably increased risk of 28-day mortality, relativetothereference(Q2,G2).Afteradjustingforcon- founders,theMIMIC-IVcohortdemonstratedasignificant correlationbetweenhighserummagnesium(asacontin- uousvariable)andtheriskof28-daymortality(OR =1.47, 95% CI: 1.12–1.93, p=0.005).
Furthermore, patients in thehigherserummagnesiumgroups(Q4,Q5)exhibiteda higherriskof28-daymortality(Q4:OR =1.19,95%CI:1.01– 1.39,p=0.033;Q5:OR =1.27,95%CI:1.07–1.50, p=0.007), comparedtotheQ2group(Figure 3).Similarfindingswere exhibited in the Chinese institutional cohort. Each unit increase in the serum magnesium index was correlated with a 93% increased risk of 28-day mortality (OR =1.93, 95% CI: 1.04–3.57, p=0.037).Patients with higher serummagnesiumlevel(groups4and5)alsoexhibitedahigher riskof28-daymortality(G4:OR =1.38,95%CI:0.87–2.18, p=0.166; G5: OR =1.52, 95% CI: 0.96–2.42, p=0.074; Figure3).Therestrictedcubicspline(RCS)curvesutilizedthecut- offvaluederivedfromthereceiveroperatingcharacteristic (ROC)curveasreference(Figure S2).InMIMIC-IVcohort, the RCS analysis revealed a positive correlation between elevated serum magnesium and OR for 28-day mortality (poverall<0.001), with the cutoff value of 0.91 mmol/L (Figure4).
While a J-shaped correlation was exhibited between serum magnesium and 28-day mortality in Chi- nese institutional cohort ( poverall=0.078), with the cutoffvalueof0.97mmol(Figure 4).However,thecorre- lation between serum magnesium and mortality in both cohorts did not show significant nonlinearity ( p=0.129 andp=0.278fornonlinearity,respectively). 4of13 LIetal.TABLE 1 CharacteristicsandoutcomesofparticipantscategorizedbyserummagnesiumintheAmericanMedicalInformationMartforIntensiveCare-IV(MIMIC -IV)cohort.

Furthermore, elevated serum magnesium levels were also linked to increased 90-day mortality, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality. These findings suggest that serum magnesium at the onset of sepsis could be a practical parameter for risk stratification and potentially act as an independent risk factor for septic patients.Previous study reported that higher serum magnesium levels at ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis,22which is consistent with our findings.Xia et al.mainly explored the trajectory of magnesium levels in septic patients dur- ingICUstayanditsrelationshipwithin-hospitalmortality, providing important evidence for clinical management.However, the study did not clarify the temporal rela- tionship between magnesium and sepsis course, and was limited to a single center.
Our study focused on serum magnesiumlevelsattheonsetofsepsis,utilizingtwointer- nationalcohortscoveringalargenumberofsamples,and demonstratedthatserummagnesiumattheonsetofsepsis was a valuable marker for patient risk stratification. Theutilization of the MIMIC database, which encompasses a large number of septic patients in the ICU, enabled the evaluationoftherelationshipbetweenserummagnesium levelsandmortalityinthispopulation.TheChineseinsti- tutionalcohort,derivedfromreal-worlddatafromtheICU ofauniversityhospitalinChina,wasemployedtofurther validate this relationship.The consistent results obtained from these two cohorts validate the relationship between high serum magnesium levels and increased mortality in sepsisacrossdifferentethnicitiesandmedicalconditions.ThesefindingsmaketheresultsapplicabletoatleastNorth AmericanandEastAsianpopulations.
Assessment of serum magnesium concentration is a commonlypracticeinclinicalpracticetoevaluatemagne- sium status, with the range considered normal generally fallingbetween0.70and0.99mmol/L.23Previousstudies have consistently shown a significantly higher incidence of hypomagnesemia compared to hypermagnesemia in medicalsettings.24,25Inthecontextofseveresepsis,hypo- magnesemiaisfrequentlyobserved.26Inlinewiththis,our study found that the median serum magnesium level in septic patients was 0.86 mmol/L (IQR: 0.82–0.98) in the MIMIC-IV cohort and 0.87 mmol/L (IQR: 0.76–1.01) in Chineseinstitutionalcohort.Furthermore,thepercentage ofindividualsintheQ4–Q5groupwas37.1%inMIMIC-IV cohort, and 43.7% in Chinese institutional cohort. These findings suggest that, at the onset of sepsis, high mag- 8of13 LIetal.

Previousstudieshaveexploredthecorrelationbetween serum magnesium levels and the risk of incidence and mortalityinvariousdiseases.Forinstance,Tanetal.found thatcriticallyillpatientswithacutemyocardialinfarction who had high-normal serum magnesium levels or hyper- magnesemia tended to have a higher 30-day in-hospital mortalityrate.27Sharmaetal.reportedthatahighpreva- lence hypermagnesemia in patients with COVID-19 was correlated with an elevated risk of mortality.20Lancaster et al.
found that higher magnesium levels were linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery.28Additionally, a study involving 39,193 partici- pantsshowedthatbothhypomagnesemiaandhypermag- nesemia at discharge were associated with higher 1-year mortality.29In critically ill patients, serum magnesium levels were strongly associated with mortality.30Despite extensive research on the effects of hypomagnesemia, there is a paucity of studies investigating the effects ofhypermagnesemiaanditsroleinmortality.Recentstudies on critically ill patients have showed that serum magne- sium concentrations exceed 2.4 mg/dL, 2.5 mg/dL, and 2.6mg/dLsignificantlyincreasetheriskofdeathissignif- icantly increased.31–33Our findings were consistent with theresultsofthepreviousstudyandprovidefurthersup- port for the association between high serum magnesium levelsandapoorprognosis. Serummagnesiumplaysanessentialroleinthepatho- physiology of sepsis.
As the second most abundant intra- cellularcation,magnesiumparticipatesinessentialphys- iological processes, including blood pressure regulation, neuronal transmission, muscle contraction, and immune regulation.34,35Severalfactorscontributetothecorrelation between high serum magnesium levels and an unfavor- able prognosis in septic patients. First, from a cardio- vascular perspective, elevated serum magnesium induces vasodilationandlowersbloodpressurebyaffectingvascu- lartoneandtherenin–angiotensin–aldosteronesystem.36 Our study demonstrated that patients with high serum LIetal.9of13 FIGURE 5 Forestplotsofoddsratios(OR)forthe28-daymortalityindifferentsubgroups.*Largedatapoint(exceedsplotlimits).CI, confidenceinterval;MIMIC-IV,MedicalInformationMartforIntensiveCare-IV;RRT,renalreplacementtherapy.magnesiumexhibitedlowermeanarterialpressure,higher lactate levels, and an increased requirement for vaso- pressor.
Considering the often unstable cardiovascular dynamicsobservedinsepticpatients,37theexacerbationof this instability by high magnesium levels may contribute to poor outcomes.
Additionally, magnesium can impede cardiacpotassiumchannels,leadingtomalignantarrhyth- miasandheartfailure,23furtherincreasingtheriskofmor- tality.Previousstudyhasindicatedracialdisparitiesincar- diovascularresponses.38Therefore,discrepanciesinmag- nesium metabolism and cardiovascular responses among racial differences may explain the variations observed in theresultsofthetwocohortsinourstudy.Second,interms ofrespiratoryfunction,elevatedmagnesiumlevelsimpede neuromuscular transmission, resulting muscle paralysis, includingtherespiratorymusclesanddiaphragm,thereby impairingrespiratoryfunctionandcontributingtorespira- toryfailure.39Ourstudydemonstratedthatamongpatients whodidnotrequiremechanicalventilationonICUday1in theMIMIC-IVcohort,eachunitincreaseinserummagne- siumwascorrelatedwitha7.41-foldincreaseintheriskof 28-daymortality.Third,magnesiumisessentialforoptimal immune function and the regulation of inflammation.40 High levels of magnesium can impair the function of endotoxin-stimulated spleen lymphocytes.41Elevatedserum magnesium levels may disrupt normal immune responses and exacerbate the dysregulated inflammatory stateinsepsis,subsequentlyleadingtopoorerprognosis.
Althoughtherewasasimilarityintheprimaryoutcome regardingthecorrelationbetweenhighserummagnesium and increased 28-day mortality in septic patients, there were still divergent results observed in the two cohorts. The distribution of mortality across various groups dif- feredbetweentheMIMIC-IVcohortandtheinstitutional cohort.Moreover, the RCS analysis revealed a positive association between increasing serum magnesium levels andtheORfor28-daymortalityintheMIMIC-IVcohort, whereas the Chinese institutional cohort exhibited a J- shaped correlation.
Several factors may account for these differences,including:(1)Baselinevariationsbetweenthe cohorts,includingethnicity(themajorityoftheMIMIC-IV cohort consisted of White individuals, while the Chi- nese institutional cohort primarily comprised East-Asian patients), SOFA score (3 in the MIMIC-IV and 5 in the Chineseinstitutionalcohort),andinterventions(ahigher percentage of ventilation in the MIMIC-IV cohort and a higherpercentageofRRTandvasopressorsintheChinese institutionalcohort).(2)Differencesinthedistributionof serum magnesium. The normal range for serum magne- sium is 0.70–0.99 mmol/L, and the bar chart in Figure 4 10of13 LIetal.indicated a higher proportion of patients with hypomag- nesemiaintheChineseinstitutionalcohort,comparedto the MIMIC-IV cohort.
Within the Chinese institutional cohort, the group with lower serum magnesium levels (G1) exhibited higher 28-day mortality than the group with serum magnesium within the normal range (G2), suggesting that hypomagnesemia and its associated poor prognosismaycontributetothedescendingtrendobserved on the left side of the RCS curve in the Chinese institu- tional cohort. However, in multiple multivariable logistic regression models, the difference between the G1 and G2 didnotreachstatisticalsignificance.Subgroupanalysisrevealedthatserummagnesiumlev- elsmighthavepredictivevalueinspecificallymaleseptic patients, potentially due to the influence of estrogen on females.
Estrogen can affect magnesium distribution, enhance magnesium utilization, and promote its uptake insofttissueandbone.42Additionally,thestudyobserved alowerproportionofwomenamongpatientswithhigher serum magnesium levels, thus providing additional sup- portforthisobservation.Furthermore,monitoringserum magnesiumlevelsmayyieldgreaterprognosticbenefitsfor elderly patients or those who do not require mechanical ventilationorvasopressorsuponICUadmission. Thepresentstudyhasseverallimitationsthatshouldbe acknowledged.First,itsretrospectivedesignprecludesthe establishment of a causal relationship.Second, the study solely collected serum magnesium levels, which may not fully represent the overall magnesium status in the body.Factors such as intracellular magnesium levels were not assessed.
Third, the precise mechanism underlying the association between high serum magnesium levels and poorprognosisinsepsisremainsunknown.Fourth,inthe MIMIC-IV cohort, there was an imbalance in the distri- bution of both known and unknown risk factors among the different groups, potentially attributing the higher mortalityobservedinpatientswithhigherserummagne- sium levels to their greater burden of acute illness and comorbidities. Although significant statistical differences observed when comparing baseline data between groups, this may be attributable to the larger sample size.How- ever,itisimportanttonotethatthenormalconcentration rangeofserummagnesiumisnarrow(0.70–0.99mmol/L), and even slight changes in concentration can potentially impact patients.Therefore, to ensure the reliability of the results, the study categorized serum magnesium into quintiles and extensively adjusted for the results of the univariate analysis.
The association between high serum magnesium levels and increased mortality remained sig- nificant.Last,subsequentserummagnesiumlevelsduring ICUhospitalizationwerenotcollected,limitingtheanaly- sis of dynamic magnesium fluctuations and their impact on prognosis. Therefore, cautious interpretation of thefindings is warranted, despite the observed differences in mortality.Furtherresearchisnecessarytobettercompre- hend the relationship between serum magnesium levels and mortality in sepsis, as well as to investigate the potential effects of magnesium fluctuations on patient outcomes.4METHODS 4.1Datasource This research made use of data from the MIMIC-IV database(version2.2)andaChineseinstitutionalcohort.43 The MIMIC-IV dataset encompasses extensive, high- fidelityelectronichealthinformationforover70,000indi- vidualstreatedintheICUatBethIsraelDeaconessMedical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, covering the period from 2008 to 2019.
To safeguard patient privacy, all personal identifiers were removed, and patient identities were replaced with random codes, negating the requirement for patient consent and ethical approval. Author Le Li (certification number 50858519) acquired permission for accessing the database and performed the extraction of data.The institutional critical care cohort was collected in the ICU of Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, a university-affiliatedhospitalwith66ICUbeds.Thehospi- talisahighlyrespectedandrenownedlarge-scalemedical institution in China, with its Intensive Care Medicine department being particularly esteemed and influential nationwide.Researchers meticulously reviewed medical records from this ICU, covering the period from January 2018toDecember2023.4.2Patientselection Thecriteriaforpatientenrollmentinthisstudyconsisted ofadultpatientsadmittedtotheICUwithsepsis,asrecog- nized by the Sepsis 3.0 definition (Figure S3).
In cases of multipleICUadmissionsbypatients,onlydatafromtheir firstICUstaywereanalyzed.Exclusionwasbasedoncrite- riasuchas:(1)ICUstaysofunder24h;(2)treatmentwith magnesium persulfate within 72 h after ICU admission; and(3)absenceofserummagnesiumdata. 4.3Dataextractionandmanagement DatawereobtainedfromtheMIMIC-IVdatabasethrough structured query language (SQL) queries, with the SQL script codes offered on GitHub ( https://github.com/MIT- LCP/mimic-iv ).The collected data included baseline LIetal.11of13 demographic information, the maximum serum magne- siumlevelattheonsetofsepsis,treatmentsadministered within 24 h of ICU admission, the recordsat the onset of sepsis(relevantclinicalscores,vitalsigns,laboratorytests), andcomorbidities.To mitigate potential bias, the analysis excluded vari- ables where the missing value was above 20%.
For those with lower missing data levels, variables were subjected to multiple imputation using a random forest algorithm, whichwasimplementedthroughthe“mice”packageinR (versionR.4.3.1).44Theimputationprocedureutilizednon- missing variables as predictors. The missingness for each variableispresentedinFigure S4.In the institutional cohort, patient data from the hos- pital’s medical record system were obtained, including demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and dis- charge status.The data collection process for this cohort mirrored that of the MIMIC-IV cohort.However, there were differences in the relevant clinical scores, with only the SOFA score and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score being recorded.Additionally, laboratory indicators such as interleukin- 6 and procalcitonin were included.Detailed information regarding the specific variables extracted can be found in theSupportingInformation.
