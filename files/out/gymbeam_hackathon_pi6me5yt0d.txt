At th e same time, reactive oxygen species are sustainably generated in situ to overcome the limitations of their shortlifetime and diffusion distance.

Due to the antibiotic- resistance crisis, there is an urgent need to develop alternative stra- tegies to combat bacterial infections while a variety of nanomaterialshave been proposed to construct antibacterial platforms 3–5.C o m p a r e d with traditional approaches, the introduction of nanotechnology intoantibacterial applications has achieved satisfactory therapeutic results,including photothermal therapy (PTT) 6–8and diverse dynamic therapies9,10. In particular, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated dynamic treatment strategies demonstrate great potential in anti-infective therapy which could cause irreversible damage to essentiallipids, DNA, and proteins, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) 11,12,chemodynamic therapy (CDT)6,8, sonodynamic therapy (SDT)13,a n d electrodynamic therapy (EDT)14.
Generally speaking, the generation efﬁciency of ROS is either dependent on the external triggers (e.g., light, ultrasound, and electric ﬁeld) or internal stimuli such as endo- genous hydrogen dioxide (H 2O2). However, the hypoxia and insuf ﬁ- cient H 2O2content in the infectious microenvironment greatly limits the therapeutic effectiveness of the oxygen-dependent PDT, SDT,and H 2O2-dependent CDT15–17.As an emerging dynamic therapeutic strategy, EDT stimulated by electric ﬁeld can produce hydroxyl radi- cals (·OH) in a sustainable and microenvironment-independentmanner 9,18–21, showing distinct advantages in bacterial infection and clinical translation.

To further improve therapeutic ef ﬁcacy, the combination of EDT with chemotherapy20,21,C D T22,P D T14,s t a r v a t i o nt h e r a p y19,a n d immunotherapy23has been proposed. On the other hand, enhanced EDT was achieved by the rational design of nano-electrosensitizers.For example, Pt-Cu alloy nanoparticles was found to promote ROS pro-duction through increasing the intracellular concentration of chlorideion 24.The introduction of Pd in the composite Pt-Pd nanoparticles could realize synergistic electrocatalytic effect with Pt23.H o w e v e r ,t h e underlying functional mechanisms by which the tailored nano-electrosensitizers improve catalytic activity remain to be furtherinvestigated.In addition, the application of EDT was limited to tumortreatment 18–24and antibacterial wound dressing14, while there is a great need to explore more disease models.
Meanwhile, strong interactionsbetween nano-electrosensitizers and bacteria are required to over- come the short lifetime and diffusion distance of ·OH to achieve improved bactericidal effect 25,26. Therefore, the development of orchestrated nanoplatforms to achieve ef ﬁcient EDT in complex in vivo infection environments still remains a great challenge.As nano-sized membrane vesicles, extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by cells have shown great ef ﬁciency in the construction of biomimetic nanoplatforms27,28.In addition to excellent biocompat- ibility and blood circulation stability, the natural cellular uptake andinherent targeting properties of EVs originating from the cell mem-brane proteins on the surface make them ideal candidates for deliverysystems 29,30.Compared with EVs derived from mammalian cells, plant- derived edible EVs with low immunological risk and intrinsic therapeutic activity are green, sustainable, renewable, and mass-producible 31–34.
Ginseng-derived EVs are ef ﬁciently taken up by bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to stimulate neural differ-entiation, while grapefruit EVs are able to deliver therapeutic agentsor nanoparticles with enhanced cellular internalization for tumortreatment 29,32,33. More interestingly, ginger-derived EVs are found to be selectively internalized by gut bacteria ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus )o r periodontal pathogen ( Porphyromonas gingivalis ) in an EV lipid- dependent manner to shape the gut microbiota or inhibitpathogenicity 35,36.The unique property of EVs that can be taken up by bacteria inspired us to propose a more ef ﬁcient antibacterial nanoplatform through integrating EVs and superior nano-electrosensitizers.In this context, it is expected that both enhancedaccumulation of nanoparticles at infection sites without immuneclearance and strong interaction between ·OH and bacteria can beachieved for improved EDT and bactericidal effect.
Herein, we demonstrate a rational design of a biomimetic nano- platform (EV-Pd-Pt) by combining ginger-derived EVs and Pd-Ptnanosheets for synergistic bacteria eradication (Fig. 1).Pd-Pt nanosh- eets were conjugated onto the surface of ginger-derived EVs via theamide reaction between carboxylic group-functionalized Pd-Pt and abundant amino groups on the surface of EVs to construct the nano- platform.The electro-driven catalytic activity of Pd-Pt nano-electro-sensitizers was supposed to be enhanced compared with Ptnanoparticles, which was veri ﬁed by both experimental data and computational simulation.The excellent biocompatibility and longblood circulation time introduced by EVs guarantee the accumulationof EV-Pd-Pt at the infection sites without immune elimination.
Moreimportantly, EV-Pd-Pt was hypothesized to enter the interior of bac-terial cells in an EV lipid-dependent manner and generate ROS in situ,resulting in strong interaction with bacteria and ef ﬁcient eradication of bacterial infection by high-performance EDT. In addition, takingadvantage of the photothermal property of Pd-Pt, photoacoustic (PA) imaging-guided synergistic EDT/PTT could be achieved since the cat- alytic activity of Pd-Pt could be further enhanced by heat induced bynear infrared (NIR) light irradiation.Furthermore, the bactericidaleffect in vivo was explored by a mouse model of subcutaneousabscesses infected with Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus ).Results Preparation and characterization of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles The Pd-Pt nano-electrosensitizers were prepared through a facile seed- mediated growth strategy employing Pd nanosheets as seeds and polyvinylpyrrolidone as a stabilizer37,38.As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig.
2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1), well-dispersed Pd nanosheets with a uniform size of ~22 nmwere synthesized while the size of Pd-Pt nanosheets was ~30 nm.ThePd-Pt nanosheets were observed to display surface roughness withsmall Pt nanoparticles deposited on Pd nanosheets (Fig.2c).The lattice spacing of ~2.22 Å corresponding to the (111) plane of Pt con ﬁrms the crystal structure of Pt nanoparticles.The elemental mapping images ofPd-Pt nanosheets (Fig.2d) suggest the preferential distribution of Pt element on the edges of Pd nanosheets, verifying the successful pre-paration of the Pd-Pt heterostructures.The mass ratio of Pd:Pt was determined to be ~1:4 by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Fig.2e).Ginger-derived EVs were then isolated and puri ﬁed by differ- ential centrifugation and sucrose gradient centrifugation methods.Asshown in the TEM image (Fig.2f), the extracted vesicles from ginger exhibit an obvious saucer-like shape of typical EVs.
Thereafter, Pd-Ptnanosheets were functionalized with carboxylic groups and patchedonto the surface of ginger-derived EVs through amidation reaction togenerate EV-Pd-Pt (Fig. 2g).As exhibited in Supplementary Fig.2, the elemental mapping reveals the co-localization of Pd and Pt elementson EVs, demonstrating the formation of EV-Pd-Pt.The high-resolutionX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of N1s show the relatively lower peak intensity of –NH 2and higher intensity of N-C in EV-Pd-Pt compared with EVs (Supplementary Fig.3), con ﬁrming the successful conjugation of Pd-Pt nanosheets onto EVs via amide bonds.The protein components in EV-Pd-Pt analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) suggest thatthe primary membrane proteins from EVs were mostly retained inbiomimetic EV-Pd-Pt (Fig.2h).The hydrodynamic size of EV-Pd-Pt obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) was found to increase from~150 of EVs to ~190 nm (Fig.
2i), indicating the successful fabrication of EV-Pd-Pt. The weight ratio of Pd-Pt in EV-Pd-Pt was calculated to be~20% by thermogravimetric analysis.As shown in Fig.2j, the zeta potential of EV-Pd-Pt decreased from ~ −5.7 mV of Pd-Pt to ~ −22.8 mV, which is similar to the zeta potential of pure EVs (~ −22.1 mV).Com- pared with Pd-Pt nanosheets, the larger repulsive force between EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles guarantees their enhanced stability in blood.Addi-tionally, the corresponding absorption spectra indicate that EV-Pd-Ptexhibits the characteristic absorption peak of Pd-Pt at 980 nm (Fig.2k).Electrodynamic and photothermal properties of Pd-Pt nanosheets The electro-driven catalytic activity of Pd-Pt nanosheets was system- atically investigated using methylene blue (MB) as the ROS indicator in a double salt bridge system (Supple mentary Fig.4).As shown in Fig.
3a, the characteristic absorption of MB at 664 nm only decreased negli-gibly and slightly in the PBS (as control), alternating current (AC)power supply with 980 nm NIR laser irradiation (E + L), and Pd-Ptnanosheet groups. In contrast, obvious MB degradation was observedin the presence of Pd-Pt nanosheets under square-wave AC electricﬁeld (E), suggesting the ef ﬁcient generation of ·OH.After the intro- duction of 980 nm NIR laser irradiation (L), the MB degradation ratewas further accelerated, implying that the NIR laser-induced heatcould enhance the generation ef ﬁciency of ·OH.In addition, the square-wave frequency-dependent MB degradation behaviors werefound (Fig.3b).Compared with the DC ﬁeld group, the degradation rate of MB gradually slowed down with the increase of the square-wave frequency of AC ﬁeld.Therefore, the square-wave AC ﬁeld with an optimal frequency of 10 mHz was selected for the subsequent EDTstudies.
The ·OH generation under the AC ﬁeld was also veri ﬁed by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra (Fig. 3c).The oxidation ofArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34883-5 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:7164 2 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (DMPO) by two ·OH radicals produced characteristic peaks with intensity of 1:2:1:2:1:2:139.Interestingly, the ·OH signal triggered by Pd-Pt nanosheets was much stronger than thattriggered by a simple mixture of Pd nanosheets and Pt nanoparticleswith equivalent Pd and Pt contents.Taken together, Pd-Pt nanosheetsexhibit excellent catalytic activity under square-wave AC ﬁeld to pro- duce highly cytotoxic ·OH, demonstrating their great potential in EDT-mediated antibacterial therapy.Furthermore, EV-Pd-Pt showed a MBdegradation rate consistent with Pd-Pt nanosheets at the same Pd-Ptconcentration (Supplementary Fig.5), indicating the comparableelectrodynamic performance of EV-Pd-Pt and Pd-Pt.
Notably, to explore the mechanism of electro-driven catalytic activity of Pd-Pt nanosheets, density functional theory (DFT) calcula-tions were performed to simulate the dissociation reaction of H 2O molecules. In our model, atoms of Pt(111) were arranged on thePd(100) substrate to represent interfacial interaction of Pd(100)-Pthetero-nanoparticles.Firstly, the adsorption energies of H 2Oo n Pt(111), Pd(100), and Pd(100)-Pt surfaces were calculated to be 0.28,0.26, and −0.58 eV, respectively.Compared with the Pt(111) and Pd(100) surfaces, H 2O would be more favorably adsorbed on the sur- face of Pd(100)-Pt, which is bene ﬁcial to the subsequent water dis- association.The schematics and energy pro ﬁles of water dissociation on active sites of Pt(111), Pd(100) and Pd(100)-Pt surfaces are pre-sented in Fig.3d, e.The energy barrier for water molecule dissociation on the Pd(100)-Pt surface was calculated to be ~0.64 eV, which is muchlower than that on other surfaces.
These results indicate that H 2Oi s easier to dissociate into hydroxyl radicals on the surface of Pd-Pt than Pt or Pd nanoparticles, which is consistent with the MB degradation results. Furthermore, the absorption of Pd-Pt nanosheets in the desirable NIR region (Fig.2k) inspired us to further evaluate their photothermal effects.The temperature increases of the solution showed a Fig.1 | Schematic of the preparation of the EV-Pd-Pt nanoplatform and its antibacterial application.a Schematic illustration of the preparation of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles by conjugating carboxylic group-functionalized Pd-Pt nanoparticlesonto the surface of ginger-derived EVs with abundant amino groups.bPA imaging-guided synergistic EDT/PTT of bacterial infection in vivo can be achieved by applying electric ﬁeld and NIR light irradiation after intravenous injection of EV-Pd- Pt.
Long blood circulation, ef ﬁcient accumulation at infection site, and lipid- dependent cellular uptake are hypothesized to favor antibacterial ef ﬁcacy.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34883-5 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:7164 3 concentration- and time-dependent pattern after exposure to a 980 nm NIR laser (Supplementary Fig. 6).In contrast, negligible tem- perature change was observed for the pure water, illustrating theexcellent photothermal performance of Pd-Pt.Meanwhile, the colorchange in photothermal images and temperature increase of EV-Pd-Ptunder NIR laser irradiation were observed to be almost identical tothose of Pd-Pt (Supplementary Fig.7), indicating the negligible effectof EVs on the photothermal property of EV-Pd-Pt.The favorable elec-trodynamic and photothermal properties of Pd-Pt nanosheets and EV-Pd-Pt endow them with great potential for antibacterial applications.
Uptake of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles by bacteria The lipid bilayer structure of ginger-derived EVs is thought to be composed of phospholipids and glycerol lipids31,40.A m o n gt h e m , phosphatidic acid (PA) plays an important role in the uptake of ginger-derived EVs by Lactobacillus rhamnosus andPorphyromonas gingivalis , which is involved in vesicular endocytosis and could interact withproteins expressed on the bacterial surface 35,36.T h e s e ﬁndings inspiredus to investigate whether ginger-derived EV-functionalized Pd-Pt nanosheets (EV-Pd-Pt) could be taken up by bacteria. Gram-positive S.aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E.coli ) were selected as model bacteria.To evaluate the internalization of EV-Pd-Pt, the loca-lization of EV-Pd-Pt was monitored visually by confocal laser scanningmicroscope (CLSM) while Pd-Pt nanosheets were employed as coun-terparts.
The interaction of EV-Pd-Pt and Pd-Pt with the SYTO 9-stainedbacteria (green ﬂuorescence) was tracked by the red ﬂuorescence of Cy5.5 (Supplementary Fig. 8).As shown in Fig.4a, after co-cultivation for 30 min, obvious red ﬂuorescence from EV-Pd-Pt and merged yellow color of red and green ﬂuorescence were observed inside both S.aureus andE.coli , indicating that EV-Pd-Pt could effectively intercalate into bacterial membranes and enter the cytoplasm.In contrast, the bacteria incubated with Pd-Pt displayed negligible red ﬂuorescence, validating the hypothesis that ginger-derived EVs could greatly facil-itate nanoparticle-bacteria interactions and promote the uptake of EV-Pd-Pt in an EV lipid-dependent manner.Furthermore, tomographyimaging of E.coli and S.

Furthermore, the uptake of EV-Pd-Pt and Pd-Pt by bacteria was quanti ﬁed by ﬂow cyto- metry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10, signi ﬁcantly enhanced accumula- tion of EV-Pd-Pt in bacteria was found compared with Pd-Pt, validatingthe important role of EVs in preferential uptake.The PA lipids in ginger-derived EVs are considered to serve as a signal for preferential uptake of EV-Pd-Pt, as depletion of PA lipidshas been validated to lead to a signi ﬁcant reduction in uptake by Lactobacillus rhamnosus 35.To further explore the mechanism of the enhanced uptake of EV-Pd-Pt by E.coli and S.aureus , total lipids from the ginger-derived EVs were extracted with chloroform and then separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)35,36.P A - depleted lipids were also obtained by the removal of PA bandfrom the TLC according to standard PA migration.
Thereafter, totallipids and PA-depleted lipids were reassembled into nano-sized vesicles (NVs), respectively. As displayed in Supplementary Fig.11,NVs formed from PA-depleted lipids demonstrated evidentlyreduced uptake by E.coli and S.aureus .These results verify the signi ﬁcance of PA lipids in the enhanced uptake of EV-Pd-Pt.Taken together, the EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles could be successfully taken upby bacteria in an EV lipid-dependent manner, which guarantees their accumulation and strong interaction with bacteria for enhanced EDT and antibacterial activity.Biocompatibility of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles Since the biocompatibility of biomaterials is prerequisite for anti-bacterial applications, hemolysis and methylthiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assays were used to study the hemocompatibility and cyto-toxicity of EV-Pd-Pt.The hemolysis ratio of EV-Pd-Pt solutions(12.5 –200μg/mL) was much lower than the permissible limit of 5%, indicating little hemolysis of red blood cells 6(Supplementary Fig.
12a). To investigate the cytotoxicity of EV-Pd-Pt, the viability of L929 cellswas evaluated by MTT assay.As shown in Supplementary Fig.12b, the cell viability remained above 90% wh en the concentration of EV-Pd-Pt was as high as 400 μg/mL, indicating negligible cytotoxicity to L929 cells.The excellent biocompatibility of EV-Pd-Pt makes them suitablefor antibacterial applications.b c da 3460 3480 3500 3520 3540 Magnetic field (G)Intensity 0 5 10 15 20 25 300.00.51.01.5 Time (min)C/C0PBS PBS + E + L Pd-Pt Pd-Pt + E Pd-Pt + E + L Pd-Pt Pd + PtC/C0 IS TS FSPd(100)-Pt Pt(111) Pd(100) G (eV) G (eV) G (eV)Pd(100)-Pt + H2O Pt(111) + H2O Pd(100) + H2O0 5 10 15 20 25 300.20.40.60.81.0 Time (min)300 mHz 150 mHz 50 mHz 10 mHz DC e 0 0 01.02 eV0.82 eV0.64 eV Fig.3 | Electro-driven catalytic performance of Pd-Pt nanosheets.a Degradation behaviors of MB under different treatments.

Bene ﬁting from ginger-derived EVs, biomimetic EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles exhibit unique characteristics thatcan be taken up by bacteria in a lipid-reliant manner. Therefore, it wasspeculated they could accumulate inside bacteria to show a strongbactericidal effect through combined EDT and PTT (Fig.5a).The standard colony counting method was employed to quantitatively evaluate the antibacterial performance of EV-Pd-Pt (Fig.5b, c).Com- pared with the PBS-cultured control group, the three groups of S.aureus treated with square-wave AC electric ﬁeld, 980 nm NIR light irradiation, and their combination did not show obvious bacterialdeath, suggesting that neither square-wave AC ﬁeld nor the NIR lighthad any killing effect on S.aureus .Similarly, S.aureus incubated with EV-Pd-Pt exhibited a high viability of over 90%.
In contrast, the treat-ment of EV-Pd-Pt in combination with the electric ﬁeld (EV-Pd-Pt + E, EDT group) signi ﬁcantly reduced bacterial viability, con ﬁrming that potent EDT triggered by EV-Pd-Pt could combat bacterial infection. Inaddition, moderate antibacterial activity of EV-Pd-Pt was observedafter NIR light irradiation was performed (EV-Pd-Pt + L, PTT group),verifying the photothermal killing effect.As expected, the combina-tion of electric ﬁeld and NIR irradiation (EV-Pd-Pt + E + L, EDT/PTT group) induced the most severe bacterial death.Meanwhile, we determined the degree of synergy ( S)u s i n gB l i s si n d e p e n d e n c e model 41.A synergistic effect between EDT and PTT was observed in combined EDT/PTT antibacterial treatment ( S>0 )6,w h i c hw a sd u et o the enhanced catalytic activity of EV-Pd-Pt under NIR irradiation.ba Pd-Pt 1 2 3 4 1 2 341 2 3 41 2 34 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm1 μm 1 μm 1 μm 1 μm E.coli S.aureusS.aureusE.

Experi-ments were repeated three times independently with similar results.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34883-5 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:7164 6 Notably, the bactericidal performance of EV-Pd-Pt produced by com- bined EDT/PTT was substantially higher than that of Pd-Pt, validatingthe hypothesis that the internalization of EV-Pd-Pt bene ﬁting from ginger-derived EVs could promote the interaction between toxic ·OHand bacteria to achieve enhanced antibacterial activity. These resultsdemonstrate the great potential of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles to eradicatebacterial infections through exploiting their intrinsic properties.Additionally, the antibacterial effect of EV-Pd-Pt was intuitively demonstrated by live/dead staining assay.As exhibited in the CLSM images (Fig.5d), live bacteria stained with SYTO-9 displayed green ﬂuorescence while dead bacteria were labeled with propidium iodide (PI) in red.As expected, S.
aureus in the PBS-treated groups exhibited predominantly green ﬂuorescence. At the same time, evident bacterial death was observed in the EV-Pd-Pt treatment groups under thesquare-wave AC ﬁeld.Furthermore, bactericidal effect increased with the increase of the current duration time, probably due to the con-tinuous production of ROS.Upon NIR irradiation, nearly all bacteriadisplayed red ﬂuorescence in the EV-Pd-Pt + E + L treatment group, indicating the excellent antibacterial effect of the synergistic EDT/PTT.To reveal the antibacterial mechanism of EDT, the ﬂuorescent probe 2 ′,7′-dichloro ﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was employed to visualize ROS generation in S.aureus with different treatments.After the oxidation reaction with ROS, green ﬂuorescence appeared due to the generation of 2 ′,7′-dichloro ﬂuorescein.As shown in Fig.
5e, hardly any green ﬂuorescence was observed in the presence or absence of an external electric ﬁeld, indicating negligible level of ROS and little effect of electric ﬁeld stimulation on ROS production.

These results demonstrate the great potential of EV-Pd-Pt to combat bacterial infections through the synergistic effect of EDTand PTT. Antibio ﬁlm effect of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles in vitro It has been revealed that more than 80% of chronic infections are associated with bio ﬁlms43, which has become a severe threat in the clinic.More seriously, the treatment of bio ﬁlm-associated infections is challenging since the interior bacteria are protected by extracellularpolymeric substances against the host immune attack and penetrationof antibacterial agents.Encouraged by the excellent antibacterialactivity of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles, we further investigated their cap-ability against S.aureus bioﬁlms by crystal violet staining assay and plate counting method.As shown in Fig.6a, b, in the absence of EV-Pd- Pt nanoparticles, external stimulation with the square-wave AC electricﬁled and 980 nm NIR light did not noticeably attenuate bio ﬁlm bio- mass or reduce bacterial viability.
In contrast, EV-Pd-Pt could elim- inate S. aureus bioﬁlms to some extent by the application of square- wave AC ﬁled (EV-Pd-Pt + E, ~33.6%) or 980 nm NIR light irradiation (EV-Pd-Pt + L, ~57.2%).It is to be noted that the EV-Pd-Pt + E + L groupshowed a distinct decrease in both bio ﬁlm biomass (~15.6%) andbacterial viability (~9.6%) compared with monotherapy groups, indicating the excellent antibio ﬁlm effect of EV-Pd-Pt to eradicate bioﬁlms by the combination EDT/PTT.In addition, Pd-Pt-mediated EDT/PTT was also ef ﬁcient in eliminating bio ﬁlms.Remarkably, a signiﬁcant higher killing effect on S.aureus bioﬁlm was found in the EV-Pd-Pt + E + L group compared with the Pd-Pt treatment group(Fig.6b).These results suggest that EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles are pro- mising for bio ﬁlm elimination, accompanied by superior bactericidal performance resulting from ef ﬁcient internalization capacity.To further verify the destruction of S.
aureus bioﬁlms, the bac- terial morphological changes of the bio ﬁlms were observed by scan- ning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig.6c, negligible antibio ﬁlm effect was found in PBS-treated bio ﬁlms, which exhibited dense packing of S.aureus with intact spherical morphology.In con- trast, the integrity of EV-Pd-Pt-incubated bio ﬁlms was disrupted after the application of square-wave AC ﬁled or NIR light irradiation, ver- ifying the antibio ﬁlm effect of EV-Pd-Pt through photothermal ablation and ROS generation.As expected, the most severe disruption of thebioﬁlm occurred after combined EDT/PTT was performed, where most bacteria wrinkled and distorted with damaged cell membranes (redarrows in Fig.6c).These phenomena could be explained by the gen- eration of ROS inside bacteria after EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles were taken up.
Additionally, under the stimulations of electric ﬁeld and NIR light, the Pd-Pt-cultured bio ﬁlm displayed obvious dispersal, while most bacteria inside the bio ﬁlm maintained intact morphology, which is consistent with the antibio ﬁlm and killing effect of Pd-Pt (Fig. 6a, b).020406080100120Biofilm Viability ( %) 020406080100120Biofilm Biomass (%)PBS PBS + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + L EV-Pd-Pt + E Pd-Pt + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + E + La b P < 0.0001 P < 0.0001 ns P = 0.0214P = 0.0002P < 0.0001 PBS PBS + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + L EV-Pd-Pt + E Pd-Pt + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + E + L 5 μm 0.5 μm 40 μmc d Fig.6 | Antibio ﬁlm activity of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles.Biomass ( a) and corre- sponding viability ( b)o fS.aureus bioﬁlms after different treatments.Data are presented as mean values ± SD ( n= 3 independent samples).Statistical signi ﬁcance was calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).Representative SEMimages ( c) and 3D CLSM of live/dead staining ( d)o fS.aureus bioﬁlms after different treatments.

The green ﬂuorescence in the Pd-Pt + E + L group further indicates the inadequate bactericidal effect of Pd-Pt and the superiority of EV-mediated internalization. Takentogether, EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles could effectively eliminate bio ﬁlms and hold great potential in combating bio ﬁlm-associated infections through synergistic effect of EDT and PTT.In vivo imaging and biodistribution of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles are expected to be utilized in the treatment ofbacterial infections in vivo due to their satisfactory antibacterialactivity in vitro.Considering the unique internalization and long bloodcirculation time introduced by EVs, the in vivo accumulation of bio-mimetic EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles at infection sites was ﬁrstly studied with S.aureus -infected mice.
After intravenous injection, the biodis- tribution of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles in mice with subcutaneousabscesses at different time points was visually monitored by non-invasive ﬂuorescence (FL), photoacoustic (PA), and infrared thermal (IRT) imaging (Fig. 7a).PBS and Pd-Pt nanoparticles were also admi- nistrated from the tail vein for comparison.As shown in Fig.7b, no autoﬂuorescence was observed in the PBS group (I) while weak FL signals appeared at the infection site after Pd-Pt nanoparticles wereinjected (II).
In contrast, much stronger and persistent FL signals weredetected at the infection site in the EV-Pd-Pt-treated group (III) during 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 500.00.20.40.60.81.0 Time (h)Rela tive FL Intensity in Blood HL iS L u KI n020406080100 Average FL Intensity 048 1 6 2 40200400600800Avera ge PA Intens ity 0 4 6 8 16 2402468 Time (h)Relative FL Intensity Time (h)H Li S Lu InKII I III High Low LowHigh I II IIIbc P = 0.0024 d e f High II III0 h 4 h 8 h 16 h 24 hg h II III 0 min 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 50 °C 25 °CiP = 0.0350 jPBS Pd-Pt EV-Pd-Pt Pd-Pt EV-Pd-Pt Pd-PtEV-Pd-Pt EV-Pd-PtPd-PtaPA/FL/IRT imaging Nanoparticles injection Bacterial infection Day -1 Day 0 Day 1 (within 24 h) 0 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 16 h 24 h Low II IIII Fig. 7 | In Vivo imaging and biodistribution of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles.aSchematic illustration of the S.aureus infection model establishment for FL, PA, and IRT imaging.bIn vivo time-dependent FL images of S.

Interestingly, strong FL signals were observed in the kid- neys of both Pd-Pt and EV-Pd-Pt-treated groups, implying that thenanoparticles could be excreted via renal clearance. The correspond-ing quantitative analysis of Pd-Pt and EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles in dif-ferent organs with ICP-MS is consistent with the results of FL imaging(Supplementary Fig.13).Taking advantage of the photothermal properties of Pd-Pt, PA imaging of S.aureus -infected mice was performed and similar results were obtained (Fig.7f, g).EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles were distributed in the infected tissues with the highest PA intensity at 8 h after intravenousinjection, which was 1.76-fold higher than that of the Pd-Pt-injectedgroup.The 3D reconstruction of PA signal around the infection sitesfurther demonstrated the bacteria targeting and speci ﬁcity of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles (Fig.7h).Additionally, the excellent photothermal capa- city of Pd-Pt endowed EV-Pd-Pt with the IRT imaging ability.
As shown inFig.7i and Supplementary Fig. 14, at 8 h post-injection, the IRT signal and corresponding temperature at the site of infection gradually increased with irradiation time.Meanwhile, after 20 min of 980 nm NIR laser irradiation, the temperature elevation of the infected tissue of themice administrated with EV-Pd-Pt was much higher (~53 °C) than that ofPd-Pt or PBS-injected groups, demonstrating the feasibility of EV-Pd-Ptfor PTT in vivo.The in vivo FL, PA and I RT visualization of the infection sites were mainly attributed to the excellent bacteria targeting abilityand long circulation of the biomimeti c nanoparticles.Taken together, precise and accurate information could be provided by these imagingmodalities, which not only validates the effective accumulation of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles at infection sites, but also provides valuable gui-dance for the treatment of bacterial infections in vivo.
To study the clearance behavior of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles in vivo, Cy5.5-labeled nanoparticles were intravenously injected, and FLquanti ﬁcation was performed on blood samples obtained at different time points. As shown in Fig.7j, EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles exhibited much higher FL intensities in blood than Pd-Pt within 50 h, suggesting theirprolonged blood circulation bene ﬁting from ginger-derived EVs.Additionally, the FL signals in urine and feces were investigated totrack the metabolism and excretion pathways of EV-Pd-Pt.As demon-strated in Supplementary Fig.15, both hepatic metabolism and renalclearance occurred after intravenous administration of nanoparticles.Meanwhile, the clearance rate of Pd-Pt was much faster than that of EV- Pd-Pt, which is consistent with the long circulation and retention of EV- functionalized nanoparticles.
More importantly, the excretion resultsindicate that biomimetic EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles were metabolizableand could avoid potential side effects, further ensuring their biosafetyfor in vivo applications. Antibacterial activity of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles in vivo Encouraged by the excellent biocompatibility, antibacterial activityin vitro, and high accumulation ability of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles, weinvestigated the antibacterial performance of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticlesin vivo.To visualize the therapeutic effect, a mouse infection modelwas established using luciferase-expressing S.aureus .T w od a y sl a t e r , S.aureus -infected mice were intravenously injected with PBS or nano- particles via the tail vein, and bioluminescence imaging was performedto monitor the in vivo antibacterial ef ﬁciency of different treatments (Fig.8a).Representative bioluminescence images of S.aureus -infected mice 5 days post-injection are exhibited in Fig.8b.
Apparently, the PBStreatment with the application of square-wave AC ﬁeld and NIR light irradiation failed to combat S. aureus infection.In contrast, less intense bioluminescence signals were observed in the EV-Pd-Pt-mediated PTT,EDT, and Pd-Pt-mediated EDT/PTT groups after 5 days, indicating their antibacterial effects to some extent.Notably, a negligible biolumi- nescence signal appeared in the EV-Pd-Pt-mediated EDT/PTT group,demonstrating eradication of the subcutaneous abscess.In addition,bacteria at infection sites after different treatments were cultured andquanti ﬁed by the plate counting method (Supplementary Fig.16), indicating that the antibacterial performances were consistent with thebioluminescence imaging.It was found that combined EDT/PTTmediated by EV-Pd-Pt exhibited the least number of colonies while asynergistic antibacterial effect was achieved between EDT and PTTin vivo ( S>0 ) 6.
Interestingly, the synergistic EDT/PTT mediated by EV- Pd-Pt demonstrated much better bactericidal effect than Pd-Pt- mediated EDT/PTT, verifying the excellent in vivo antibacterial activ- ity of EV-Pd-Pt bene ﬁting from prolonged blood circulation, ef ﬁcient accumulation at infection sites, and uptake by bacteria. Furthermore, the expression of in ﬂammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of infected mice were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA).As displayed in Fig.8c, d, the cytokine levels of TNF- αand IL-6 in EV-Pd-Pt-mediated synergistic EDT/PTT group were signi ﬁcantly lower than those in other treatment groups after 5 days, which almostreturned to the levels of normal mice.These results suggest that thesynergistic EDT/PTT could ef ﬁciently combat bacterial infection and relieve in ﬂammation in vivo.As shown in Fig.
8e, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was also performed to visualize the in ﬂammatory cells and evaluate the antibacterial effect of different treatments.Numerous in ﬂammatory cells could be observed in the PBS + E + L group, suggesting the existence of severe bacterial infection. In con-trast, fewer in ﬂammatory cells were found in the Pd-Pt-mediated PTT, EDT, and Pd-Pt-mediated EDT/PTT groups.As expected, EV-Pd-Pt-mediated EDT/PTT group displayed negligible in ﬂammatory cells, further con ﬁrming the superiority of synergistic bacterial killing effect.Moreover, the corresponding histological analysis of major organs, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney collected from sacriﬁced mice after 5 days of treatment did not show noticeable inﬂammatory or abnormal lesions (Supplementary Fig.17).In addition, the negligible change in body weight during the treatment periodindicates the compromised side effect of the nanoparticles in vivo(Supplementary Fig.18).
Also, blood biochemical indexes of the EV-Pd-Pt + E + L group including the white blood cells, red blood cells, plateletcount, and hemoglobin did not show noticeable difference from thenormal group (Supplementary Fig. 19), validating the excellent bio-safety and biocompatibility of EV-Pd-Pt-mediated synergistic EDT/PTT.Taken together, biomimetic EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles are promising forsafe and ef ﬁcient antibacterial therapy in vivo.Discussion In conclusion, a facile strategy was proposed to fabricate biomimetic nanoplatform (EV-Pd-Pt) for synergi stic anti-infective therapy.Pd-Pt nanosheets with intrinsic electrodynamic and photothermal proper-ties were ﬁrstly synthesized.The enhanced electro-driven catalytic activity of Pd-Pt over Pt nano-electrosensitizers was veri ﬁed by both experimental data and theoretical calculations.Then ginger-derivedEVs were conjugated with Pd-Pt nanosheets to successfully fabricateEV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles.
Ginger-derived EVs endowed EV-Pd-Pt nano-particles with excellent biocompatibility and long blood circulation,which ensured the ef ﬁcient accumulation of nanoparticles at infection sites. More importantly, EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles were proved to be taken up by bacteria in an EV-dependent manner, which achievedstrong interactions with bacteria to enhance the bactericidal effect.Inparticular, the short lifetime and diffusion distance limitations of ROScould be overcome by sustainable in situ generation of ROS insideArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34883-5 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:7164 10 bacteria.Notably, a synergistic bactericidal effect between EDT and PTT was achieved, which is potent to combat bacterial and bio ﬁlm infections regardless of the microenvironment.In addition, versatileimaging including PA, FL, and IRT imaging was performed to visualizethe accumulation and excretion of nanoparticles in vivo.Finally, aluciferase-expressing S.
aureus infection mouse model was established to verify the in vivo antibacterial effect of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles. Thefavorable biocompatibility of the metabolizable EV-Pd-Pt and theirexcellent bactericidal performance bene ﬁting from synergistic EDT/ PTT suggest their feasibility for the treatment of bacterial infections 0 Highb c EV-Pd-Pt + E + L Pd-Pt + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + E EV-Pd-Pt + LPBS + E + LNormalLow d eBacterial infection -2 3 5 6Execution Bioluminescence imagingTreatment i.v.injectiona PBS + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + L EV-Pd-Pt + E Pd-Pt + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + E + L P < 0.0001P = 0.0032P = 0.0001 P < 0.0001 Normal PBS + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + L EV-Pd-Pt + E + L Pd-Pt + E + L EV-Pd-Pt + E050100150200IL-6 (pg/ mL)P = 0.0005 200 μm 200 μm 200 μm200 μm 200 μm 200 μmDay 0 d 3 d 5 d P = 0.0498 0200400600TNF-α (pg/mL) Fig.8 | In vivo antibacterial effect of EV-Pd-Pt on the luciferase-expressing S.aureus -infected mice model.

(St Louis, MO, USA).Ascorbic acid (AA) was obtained from Sinopharm Group Co.Ltd(China).Lipoic acid (LA), 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES),and citric acid (CA), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 2,2,6,6-tetra- methylpiperidine (DMPO), 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] car- bodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and methylene blue (MB) wereprovided by Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China).Thiol-modi ﬁed poly- ethylene glycol (HS-PEG) was obtained from PonsureBio (Shanghai,China).
N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >90%), acetone (>99.5%), ethanol (>99.7%), and sodium hydroxide(NaOH) were provided by Beijing Chemical Works (China). All thereagents were analytical reagent grade and used without further pur-iﬁcation.The lysogeny broth (LB) solution was autoclaved for 20 min at 120 °C before use.The strains of E.coli (ATCC 25922) and S.aureus (CMCC (B) 26003) were obtained from Promega (Madison, USA).The LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (L7012) was purchased from Invitrogen (LifeTechnologies, USA).Synthesis of Pd nanosheets Typically, 16 mg of Pd(acac) 2, 30 mg of PVP, 60 mg of CTAB, and 170 mg of CA were mixed in a glass ﬂask containing 10 mL of DMF.The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h to obtain a homo-geneous orange-red solution.100 mg of W(CO) 6was subsequently added.The mixture was then heated to 80 °C in N 2atmosphere and kept under magnetic stirring for 1 h.
After cooling down to roomtemperature, the resultant Pd nanosheets were precipitated using acetone, collected by centrifugation at 5000 g, and re-dispersed in deionized water for subsequent experiments. Synthesis and functionalization of Pd-Pt nanosheets The Pd-Pt nanosheets were synthesized by a seed-mediatedmethod 37,38.Brie ﬂy, 101.75 mg of PVP and 600 mg of AA were mixed with 5 mL of the as-synthesized Pd nanosheet suspension.Then, themixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 min, and 0.5 mL ofK 2PtCl 4aqueous solution (100 mM) was added.The mixture was vig- orously stirred for another 30 min at room temperature and thenimmediately transferred to a 90 °C oil bath for 4 h.After cooling down to room temperature, the Pd-Pt nanosheets were collected and washed with distilled water several times.To functionalize the Pd-Pt nanosh-eets, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) was ﬁrstly synthesized.
30 g of LA was added to 100 mL of anhydrous ethanol and the pH of the solutionwas adjusted to ~9 with NaOH solution. Then sodium borohydride wasadded to trigger the ring opening of the dithiolane.After stirring atroom temperature for 1 h, DHLA was obtained by ﬁltration and eva- poration.Then, 20 mg of SH-PEG and DHLA (molar ratio = 5:1) wasadded in the above Pd-Pt nanosheet solution for carboxyl functiona-lization and improved stabilization.Finally, the solution was keptstirring for 12 h, and the carboxyl-functionalized Pd-Pt nanosheetswere collected by centrifugation at 18,000 gf o r2 0m i na n ds t o r e da t 4 °C for subsequent use.Isolation and puri ﬁcation of EVs The EVs derived from ginger were extracted from fresh ginger roots32,44.Firstly, the fresh ginger roots were purchased from a localstore and washed thoroughly with deionized water.The ginger was minced, soaked in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH7.4), and then ground in a blender to obtain ginger juice.
Blendedginger juice was sequentially centrifuged at 1000 gfor 10 min, 3000 g for 20 min, and 10,000 gfor 40 min at 4 °C to remove large particles andﬁber fragments. The supernatant was collected for further ultra- centrifugation (Beckman Optima XE-100, Beckman, USA) at 150,000 gfor 2 h.Then, the pellet was resuspended in PBS and transferred to asucrose gradient (8%, 15%, 30%, 45%, and 60%), followed by cen-trifugation at 150,000 gfor 2 h to isolate and purify EVs.The bands between the 8%/30% layer and 30%/45% layer were harvested sepa-rately and then washed with PBS, followed by centrifugation at150,000 gfor 1 h at 4 °C.The obtained EVs were then resuspended in PBS and stored at −80 °C for further use.The mass of EVs was deter- mined by weighing after lyophilization.Preparation of EV-Pd-Pt nanoparticles Brieﬂy, 1.0 mg of functionalized Pd-Pt nanosheets were dispersed in 2 mL of MES buffer (pH 6.0), and then 6.0 mg of EDC and 6.0 mg ofNHS were added to activate the -COOH groups.
After being stirred atroom temperature for 2 h, the prepared EVs (5.0 mg) were added, andthe solution was shaken overnight. Finally, the EV-Pd-Pt were harvestedby ultracentrifugation at 8000 gf o r2 0 m i na n dr e - d i s p e r s e di nP B S buffer.The content of Pd-Pt nanosh eets in EV-Pd-Pt was determined by using a Tarsus TG 209 F3 thermogravimetric analyzer (Netzsch, Ger-many).The thermogravimetric measurements were carried out in air from room temperature to 850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.Electro-driven catalytic a ctivity of Pd-Pt nanosheets The electro-catalytic activity of Pd-Pt nanosheets was evaluated by analyzing the degradation rates of MB18–21.Typically, 2 mL of an aqu- eous solution containing Pd-Pt nanosheets (50 μg/mL) and MB (3 × 10−5M) was placed in a cell of a 24-well plate, which was equipped with symmetrically arranged platinum electrodes and salt bridges(Φ= 3 mm, Saturated KCl).
The two electrodes were connected with s q u a r e - w a v eA Cw i t hd i f f e r e n tf r e q u e n c i e s( i . e .,1 0 ,5 0 ,1 5 0 ,a n d300 mHz).At ﬁxed time intervals, 50 μL of the mixed solution was extracted to measure the absorption of MB.I na d d i t i o n ,t h e· O Hg e n e r a t i o nw a sv e r i ﬁed by ESR spectra.Brieﬂy, a 1 mL solution (50 μg/mL) of Pd-Pt nanosheets or a mixture of Pd nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles with the equiva-lent Pd and Pt contents was added into the solution containing10μLo fD M P O ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .T h e n, the mixture was exposed to the square-wave AC ﬁeld with 10 mHz for 30 min, and the char- acteristic signals were recorded on an ELEXSYS-II E500 ESRspectrometer (Bruker, Germany).
Calculation method In this work, structural optimization was performed by using ﬁrst- principles calculations within the framework of DFT, as implementedin the plane wave set Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.The exchange-correlation energy was modeled by using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradientapproximation (GGA). A cutoff energy of 400 eV was adopted.AGaussian smearing of 0.02 eV to the orbital occupation was appliedduring the geometry optimization and for the total energy computa-tions.The k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was obtained using a3 × 3 × 1 grid for the repetitive unit.A large vacuum slab of 15 Å wasinserted in the z-direction for surface isolation to prevent interactionbetween two neighboring surfaces.A four-layer supercell was modeled for Pt(111), Pd(100), and Pd(100)- Pt (ten atoms of Pt(111) on Pd(100)) respectively.
The upper two atomic layers of the slab were allowed torelax freely, while the bottom two atomic layers were ﬁxed to simulate the bulk phase. Activation barriers for elementary steps of hydrolysiswere determined by the climbing image nudged elastic band methodArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34883-5 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:7164 12 (CI-NEB).The adsorption energy of H 2O adsorbed on the surface model is de ﬁned as: Ead=EH2O@slab/C0Eslab/C0EH2O ð1Þ Among them, EH2O@slabis the total energy of H 2O@slab (slab = Pt(111), Pd(100), and Pd(100)-Pt).E slabis the energy of the surface model and is the energy of H 2O.Photothermal property of Pd-Pt nanosheets To investigate the photothermal performances of Pd-Pt, PBS bufferscontaining different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL) of Pd-Pt were continuously exposed to 980 nm laser irradiation at apower density of 0.5 W/cm 2for 40 min.
The temperatures were recorded by an infrared thermal imaging camera (FLIR Systems Inc.,Ohio, USA) at predetermined time points. Uptake of Nanoparticles by bacteria E.coli (ATCC 25922) and S.aureus (CMCC (B) 26003) were employed for CLSM observation45.Pd-Pt-Cy5.5 was ﬁr s t l yp r e p a r e db yc o n j u g a t - ingﬂuorescent Cy5.5-NHS onto the surface of Pd-Pt.Brie ﬂy, 20 mg of SH-PEG-NH 2and DHLA (molar ratio = 5:1) were mixed in the above Pd- Pt solution and kept stirring for 12 h.The NPs were then dispersed inPBS (0.1 M, pH 8.5) after centrifugation, followed by the addition of1.0 mg/mL Cy5.5-NHS, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 4 °C inthe dark for 24 h.Finally, the resulting Pd-Pt-Cy5.5 was puri ﬁed by centrifugation.Cy5.5-labeled EV-Pd-Pt was prepared by conjugatingPd-Pt-Cy5.5 onto the surface of EVs.
The conjugation with Cy5.5 wasconﬁrmed by Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, America) andﬂuorescence spectroscopy (Hitachi F-7000) with excitation at 640 nm, respectively. Thereafter, Cy5.5-labeled EV-Pd-Pt and Pd-Pt (Pd- Pt concentration of 100 μg/mL, 0.5 mL) were cultured with bacterial suspensions (2 × 10 8CFU/mL, 0.5 mL) for 30 min.The bacteria were stained with SYTO 9 (6 μmol/mL in PBS) and the samples were observed by CLSM (Leica, SP8).For TEM imaging of the bacterialsections, the bacteria (2 × 10 8CFU/mL, 0.5 mL) were incubated with EV- Pd-Pt (Pd-Pt concentration of 100 μg/mL, 0.5 mL) for 30 min, washed with PBS twice, and ﬁxed overnight using 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature.Then secondary ﬁxation with 1% osmium tetra- oxide and dehydration in a gradient ethanol series were performed.The bacteria were ﬁnally embedded in Epon resin after polymerization overnight.
Embedded samples were sectioned (100 nm in thickness) and examined under a transmission electron microscope (HT-7800,Hitachi, Japan). In addition, the uptake of EV-Pd-Pt and Pd-Pt nano-particles was quanti ﬁed by ﬂow cytometry (BD Accuri C6 plus, USA) and by FlowJo software.The Pd content in bacteria was determined byICP-MS (Agilent 7700).Cytotoxicity assay 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphe-nyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)assay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the resultant EV-Pd-Pt.In this work, L929 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 4cells per well, and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C.Then, the medium was replaced with a fresh culture medium (100 μL) containing EV-Pd-Pt with different concentrations.After being co-cultured for24 h, 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) were added to each well and then incubated for another 4 h.
Finally, 100 μLo fD M S Ow a st r a n s - ferred to each well to produce formazan crystals, and the absorbancevalues at 490 nm were recorded using a Bio-Rad Model 680 MicroplateReader (UK). Hemolysis analysis The blood from mice was suspended in PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) and red blood cells (RBCs) were separated by centrifugation.The RBCs were then washed with PBS until the supernatant was clear.Thereafter, RBCstock dispersion (100 μL) were added into 1 mL of PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) containing EV-Pd-Pt with different concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25,and 12.5 μg/mL), and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.Pure water and PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) were used as the positive control and negative control, respectively.After centrifugation at 425 gfor 15 min, the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm was measured.Finally,the hemolysis ratio was calculated by the following equation.
Hemolysis ratio ð%Þ= ODtest/C0ODneg ODpos/C0ODneg×1 0 0 % ð2Þ Where ODtestrepresents the absorbance of RBCs exposed to EV-Pd-Pt, ODnegrepresents the absorbance of RBCs exposed to PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4), and ODposis the OD value of RBCs exposed to water. In vitro antibacterial assay S.aureus (Gram-positive, CMCC (B) 26003) were employed as the representative bacteria to investigate the antibacterial effect of EV-Pd-Pt through the plate counting method 46,47.Firstly, the bacteria were cultured aerobically in an LB medium at 37 °C for 12 h and harvested at the logarithmic growth phase.Then, 0.8 mL of bacterial suspensionwith a concentration of 10 6CFU/mL was treated with 0.2 mL of EV-Pd- Pt or Pd-Pt solution at a ﬁnal Pd-Pt concentration of 50 μg/mL in the presence or absence of AC electric ﬁeld (10 mHz, 20 min) and 980 nm NIR light irradiation (0.5 W/cm2, 20 min), respectively.
The bacterial suspensions in different groups were then studied: PBS, PBS + L,PBS + E, PBS + E + L, EV-Pd-Pt, Pd-Pt + E + L, EV-Pd-Pt + L, EV-Pd-Pt + E,EV-Pd-Pt + E + L. Thereafter, the bacterial suspensions were diluted 50t i m e sw i t hP B S .T h e n5 0 μL of diluted bacterial solution were spread on the LB agar plate and further incubated at 37 °C for 16 h to count the number of colonies.Live/dead bacterial staining analysis The bacterial suspensions (106CFU/mL) was incubated with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) or EV-Pd-Pt ( ﬁnal concentration: 50 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 30 min, with or without square-wave AC treatment (10 mHz, differentdurations of 5, 10, and 20 min) and NIR irradiation (0.5 W/cm 2,2 0m i n ) .Then, the bacterial suspension (109CFU/mL) was mixed with SYTO 9 and PI for 10 min.Finally, the stained bacteria were imaged using CLSM(Leica, SP8).ROS detection in bacteria Brieﬂy,S.aureus suspension at a concentration of 106CFU/mL was co- cultured with EV-Pd-Pt at 37 °C for 10 min.
Subsequently, the bacteriawere stained with DCFH-DA (10 μM), and treated with AC electric ﬁeld (10 mHz) with or without NIR irradiation (0.5 W/cm 2). After being washed three times by PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4), the bacteria (109CFU/mL) were imaged using CLSM (Leica, SP8).In vitro antibio ﬁlm assay Firstly, S.aureus w a sc u l t u r e di nL Bm e d i u ma t3 7° C ,a n dt h eb i o ﬁlm was harvested in a confocal glass dish after 3 days of culture.Then, bio ﬁlms were randomly divided into seven groups for different treatments: (1) PBS, (2) PBS + E + L, (3) Pd-Pt + E + L, (4) EV-Pd-Pt, (5) EV-Pd-Pt + E, (6) EV-Pd-Pt + L, and (7) EV-Pd-Pt + E + L.The bio ﬁlms were then treated with EV-Pd-Pt or Pd-Pt solution at a Pd-Pt concentration of 100 μg/mL with or without AC electric ﬁeld (10 mHz, 20 min) and 980 nm NIR light irra- diation (0.5 W/cm 2, 20 min), respectively.Crystal violet method was employed to quantify the biomass of these bio ﬁlms.
Brie ﬂy, the bio ﬁlms were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min and washed twice withPBS (10 mM, pH 7.4). Finally, 500 μL of ethanol was added to the plate to extract crystal violet, and the abs orbance at 595 nm was recorded by Bio-Rad Model 680 Microplate Reade r (UK).In addition, the antibio ﬁlm effect was quanti ﬁed by standard plate counting assay.The bio ﬁlms were detached into sterile PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) by sonication andArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34883-5 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:7164 13 vortexing.Thereafter, the diluted suspension was spread onto agar plates and the colony-forming unit s were counted after incubation at 37 °C for 16 h.To realize live/dead observation, the bio ﬁlms were stained by the mixed SYTO 9/PI dyes and imaged using CLSM.For SEM imaging, the dishes containing S.aureus bioﬁlm were ﬁxed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, and dehydrated in gradient ethanol (50%, 75%, 90%,and 100%).
After drying, the samples were sprayed with gold andobserved by SEM (Zeiss Supra 55). S.aureus subcutaneous infection mouse model All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the pro- tocols approved by the Ethical Committee of the Chinese Academy ofMedical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.Female Balb/cmice (4 –6 weeks old) were acquired from Beijing Vital River Labora- tory Animal Technology Co., Ltd.(Beijing, China).The mice were anesthetized with iso ﬂurane.The infection mouse model was estab- lished by injecting S.aureus suspension (3 × 10 8CFU/mL, 100 μL) into the right thigh.After 24 h, a subcutaneous abscess was created at thesite of infection.In vivo FL imaging The S.aureus -infected mice were intravenously injected by 200 μLo f PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4), EV-Pd-Pt-Cy5.5 and Pd-Pt-Cy5.5 (Pd-Pt con-centration of 2 mg/mL), respectively.
The real-time FL imaging atpredetermined time points (0, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 h) were carried out using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, America). To evaluate the in vivo biodistribution of nanoparticles, the mice weresacriﬁced 8 h after injection and the main organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) and infected thigh tissues were collected for FLimaging.In vivo PA imaging For in vivo PA imaging, EV-Pd-Pt or Pd-Pt nanoparticles (2 mg/mL,200μL) were intravenously injected into S.aureus -infected mice respectively.PA images were acquired 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after theinjection.A series of cross-section images were obtained using the multispectral optoacoustic tomography system (MSOT invision 256- TF, iThermedical, Germany).In Vivo IRT imaging To investigate in vivo IRT imaging, 200 μL of EV-Pd-Pt or Pd-Pt solution (Pd-Pt concentration of 2 mg/mL) were injected into the mice intra-venously, and PBS-treated group was regarded as a control.
After 8 h,the infected regions were irradiated by a 980 nm laser (0.5 W/cm 2)f o r 20 min. The temperature variations and images were recorded by aninfrared thermal camera (FLIR Systems Inc., Ohio, USA) at pre-determined time points during laser irradiation.In vivo blood circulation and excretion analysis of EV-Pb-Pt The infected mice were injected intravenously with PBS (10 mM, pH7.4), EV-Pd-Pt-Cy5.5, and Pd-Pt -Cy5.5 (at a concentration of 2 mg/mL),respectively.At different time points, the samples of blood, urine, andfeces were collected and analyzed using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum(Caliper Life Sciences, America).Antibacterial effect in vivo The subcutaneous infected mice were prepared via subcutaneousinjection with the luciferase-expressing S.aureus (100μL, ~10 8CFU/ mL).After 48 h, subcutaneous abscesses could be observed at the infected sites.
Balb/c mice (4 weeks old) were randomly divided into ﬁve groups with seven mice in each group for different treatments: (1) PBS + E + L, (2) Pd-Pt + E + L, (3) EV-Pd-Pt + E, (4) EV-Pd-Pt + L, and(5) EV-Pd-Pt + E + L, respectively. 200 μLo fP B So rn a n o p a r t i c l e sa ta Pd-Pt concentration of 2 mg/mL were injected intravenously via the tailvein, respectively.The treatment of square-wave AC ﬁeld (10 mHz, 20 min) or 980 nm NIR (0.5 W/cm 2, 20 min) irradiation were performed at 8 h post-injection.For bi oluminescence imaging, 75 μL of luciferin (15 mg/mL, PerkinElmer, America) was injected to each mouse and the distribution of luciferase-expressing S.aureus was visualized at different post-injection time points through a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (CaliperLife Sciences, America ).The body weight of each mouse was recorded every day throughout the treatment.After 5 d, the blood samples fromthe EV-Pd-Pt + E + L group were collected for various blood-indexmeasurements.
Moreover, the in ﬂammatory factors TNF- αand IL-6 in serum were analyzed by ELISA ki ts. Then all mice were sacri ﬁced and the infected tissues were excised and homogenized in normal saline.50 μL o fd i l u t e db a c t e r i a ls u s p e n s i o nw a ss p r e a do n t oL Ba g a rp l a t ea n dc u l -tured at 37 °C for 24 h.Then the number of colonies was counted.Majororgans including heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were harvested andﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde solution for H&E staining.Statistical analysis Data were presented as means ± standard deviation and are from at least three independent experiments.The differences were calculatedby using two-tailed Student ’st-test for two groups or one-way ANOVA for three or more groups followed by Dunnett ’s multiple comparison post-hoc test.The statistical analysis were carried out with the sofe-ware of Excel 2019 or GraphPad Prism.The level of signi ﬁcance in all statistical analyses was set at P<0 .0 5 .
