Three hundred sexually mature quail (200 females and100 males) were distributed among 5 groups at 12 wk ofage in a completely randomized design. Group 1:received basal diet not including additives and acted asa control group.Groups 2 and 3: received a basal dietwith 250 and 500 mg ginger/kg feed, respectively.Groups 4 and 5: received a basal diet with 200 and 400 mg frankincense oil/kg feed, respectively.Results revealed that egg production parameters of laying Japa-nese quail were not in ﬂuenced by ginger or frankincense oil added in all groups tested during experimentalp e r i o d se x c e p ta tt h et i m e( 1 5 −18 wks.).Moreover, egg weight was signi ﬁcantly increased only during the period (15 −18 wks.) and total period (12 −21 wk of age), and group 5 recorded the highest weight during the 2 periods studied.Fee d additives did not impact feed consumption or feed conversion ratio ( FCR ).Except for WBCs, Hb, and monocytes, treatmentsimpacted blood hematological parameters.
Also, bloodserum parameters were in ﬂuenced by feed additives, except total protein, albumin , globulin, and creatinine were not in ﬂuenced. Moreover, histological examina- tion of the spleen was in ﬂuenced by feed additives.It is concluded that utilizing frankincense oil or ginger powder in diets of laying Japanese quails enhancedblood serum properties and improved reproductive andproductive performance.Key words: ginger powder, frankincense oil, Japanese quail, production performance, antioxidant activity 2023 Poultry Science 102:102988 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2023.102988 INTRODUCTION Livestock production aims to produce a high-quality product at a low price.In addition to the increasingdemand for domestic animal meat, continuous, active,and targeted health care is required to prevent thedevelopment of diseases.The poultry industry is under increasing pressure to produce high-quality productsand high consumer volumes.
Antibiotics have been uti-lized worldwide as antibacterial, growth-promoting feedadditives to control and prevent disease-causing bacteriain the intestinal mucosa to drive meat and egg produc- tion ( Abdelnour et al., 2019 ,2020; Abd El-Hack et al., 2020,2022;Attia et al., 2020 ;Swelum et al., 2021 ). How- ever, leftovers from the overuse of antibiotics in chickenproduction have become unfavorable ( Chandrakar et al., 2023 ) and the spread of antibiotic-resistant micro- organisms in humans ( Shahin et al., 2002 ).In January /C2112023 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received July 1, 2023.Accepted July 28, 2023.1Corresponding author: mariusz.jaremko@kaust.edu.sa 1 2006, the European Union prohibited using antibiotics as growth enhancers ( Eckert et al., 2010 ).
Grassy excerpts are herbal-obtained materials blended with ani-mal feed to enhance growing production and outputquality ( Emwas et al., 2019 ,2020,2021,2023;Chandra et al., 2021a ,b). They have been categorized with a remark about their origins and vital basics: extracts, sea-soning, main oils (lipophilic compounds obtained fromthe vapor distillation of herbs), and olive (complexes gotten from nonhydrolyzed solvents) ( Windisch et al., 2007).Ginger roots ( Zingiber of ﬁcinale ) have been utilized forﬂavoring or ﬂavor-enhancing treatments.Increased poultry production, enhanced mash ﬂavor and palatabil- ity, increased nutrient intake, and advanced stomachenzyme out ﬂow are all bene ﬁts of using ginger instead of an antibiotic growth-promoting agent ( Kothari et al., 2019).Every antibiotic or fully arti ﬁcial material applied like a feed additive in the domestic animal ration isunder debate for its possible toxic in ﬂuence.
In addition, there is a forward way for products of natural origin todecrease the utilization of synthetic materials ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). As a result, medicinal grass or its deriva- tives are considered safe and offer a workable option foraddressing client wants and managing marker competi- tions ( Ali et al., 2008 ;Onu, 2010 ).Shirin and Jamuna (2010) reported that ginger is remarkable as it is wealthy in nutrients like amino acids,minerals, fatty acids and vitamins.Also, ginger includesa lot of bioactive composites, such as terpenes and phe-nolic materials.Most phenolic chemicals are gingerol,gingerdione, gingerdiol, shogaol, and paradol ( Zhao et al., 2011 ;Stoner 2013 ,Liu et al., 2019 ), which are strong intestinal mucous membrane animators ( Dieu- mou et al., 2009 ).
Also, ginger has shown several bioac- tive activities, such as antioxidants ( Nile and Park, 2015), and helpful impacts on health by reducing free radical harm and rising cardiovascular cases ( Verma et al., 2004 ;El-Kashif, 2022 ). This study aimed to estimate the effects of natural feed additives (ginger or frankincense oil) as a phyto- genic additive and naturalistic antioxidant on produc- tive performance, serum metabolites and antioxidantactivity of Japanese quail.MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Design and Diets This experiment was conducted at the Poultry Research Laboratory, part of the Faculty of Agriculture (Saba Basha) at Alexandria University.After 2 wk ofobservation, 300 Japanese quail birds (200 females and100 males) were chosen and constructed on an egg pro-duction average of greater than 70%.
They were thenrandomly assigned to 5 experimental groups, each con-taining 60 birds (40 hens and 20 males), and each wasdivided into 5 replicates with 12 birds (8 hens and 4 males). Quails were housed in wire-laying pens (2 hens and 1 male) from the open house system for the durationof the experiment, which begging at 12 wk of age and ﬁn- ished at 21 wk of age.Isocaloric and isonitrogenous rations were formulated inTable 1 .Renewed feed was only kept for a week at a time and was blended every week.For the 9-wk experi-ment, both feed and water were ad libitum available.Throughout the laying term, all laying hens wereexposed to 16 h of constant light every day.All experi-mental birds were raised in the same environmental, san-itary, and administrative environments.
The experimental groups were: Group1) basal diet with no supplement and acted as a control group, Group2) basal diet with 250 mg ginger/Kg of diet, Group 3)basal diet with 500 mg ginger/Kg diet, Group 4) basaldiet with 200 mg frankincense oil/Kg of diet and group5) basal diet with 400 mg frankincense oil/Kg of ration. Egg Production Traits The egg number was recorded daily and the laying rate was calculated for each pen within each experimen-tal group during the experimental period.Also, eggswere individually weighed to the nearest gram during the experimental period.The egg mass of each experi- mental group was calculated throughout the experi-ment.Every pen ’s Feed intake and conversion ratio (FCR ) were recorded weekly during the experimental time.Blood Sampling Six chickens fasting from every treatment were ran- domly chosen and slaughtered after the trial.Beforebeing slaughtered, a ﬂank vein sample containing about 3 mL of blood was taken.
Two equal portions of collected blood samples were split. To de ﬁne the hematological parameter, the ﬁrst fraction was gathered using heparinTable 1.structure and analysis of the main experimental ration.Ingredients % Yellow corn 60.50 Soybean meal (44%) 22.60Concentrate (50%)110.00 Di-calcium phosphate 0.40Limestone 5.50 Sunﬂower oil 1.00 Total 100Calculated analyses 2: Crude protein, % 20.08ME (Kcal/ Kg diet) 2,939.89Ether extract, % 2.60 Crude ﬁber, % 3.04 Methionine, % 0.71Methionine + cystine, % 0.90Lysine, % 1.15Calcium, % 2.58Av.phosphorus 0.40 1Concentrate: ME (K cal/kg) 2,870, crude protein 50%, crude ﬁber 1.51%, crude fat 1.54%, calcium 4.29%, phosphorus 2.39%, NaCl 0.8%,methionine 4.6%, methionine and cystine 5.38%, lysine 3.90%.2According to NRC (1994) .2 DOSOKY ET AL.as an anticoagulant (0.1 mL of heparin to 1 mL of blood).The serum was separated from the second frac- tion by centrifuging for 15 min at 4,000 rpm while coagu-lating.
The serum was recovered and then frozen at -18°C for examination. All biochemical tests (including those for total pro- tein, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, aspartate amino-transferase, and alanine aminotransferase, total lipids,total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins [ LDL ], high- density lipoproteins [ HDL ], triglycerides, creatinine, and uric acid) were performed.Malondialdehyde(MDA ) and total antioxidant capacity peroxidase measurements were made utilizing industrial kits fromBio-Diagnostics, Egypt ( www.bio-diagnostic.com ); serum globulin levels were calculated by deducting albu-min values from total protein values; and phagocyticactivity ( PA) was assessed following Kawahara et al.(1991) .
One milliliter of cetranic blood taken from treated and control quails were mixed in a water bathheated to between 23 and 25 degrees Celsius with 50micrograms of Candida albicans (formerly modi ﬁed to 1 g of Candida albicans per 100 mL of saline solution).After 3 to 5 h, blood smears were stained with Giemsasolution, and the percentage of macrophages that con-tained intracellular macrophages was used to determine the amount of phagocytosis as a proportion of PA, per (PA). Using the phagocytosis index ( PI), the numeral of phagocytic organisms in phagocytic cells was calcu-lated and categorized (PI) ( Nurhayati et al., 2022 ).Results were given as means §Se.Differences were eval- uated using the Student ttest ( Mishra et al., 2019 ).Phagocytic activity (PA) = Percentage of phagocytic cells containing yeast cells.
Phagocytic index PI ðÞ ¼Number yeast cells phagocytized Number of phagocytic cells As previously illustrated, the lymphocytic transfor- mation test ( LTT ) was carried out with a few minor modi ﬁcations ( Bosisio, 1992 ). In brief, as previously mentioned, 6 hens from each group were divided into 2groups at 21 wk.The PBMCs were then gathered inRPMI-1640 growth media (not including phenol red,with NaHCO 3, Sigma, Cairo, Egypt) to which 0.25 g/ 100 mL HEPES, 100 IU/mL of benzyl penicillin, and 100 g/mL of streptomycin sulphate were inserted.Try-pan blue dye exclusion was utilized to ascertain the via-bility of the cells.The cells were then modi ﬁed to have 5£10 6viable cells per milliliter and plated in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed tissue culture plates (Nunclon, Denmark).In duplicate wells, along with unstimulated controlwells, cells were encouraged (10 g/mL) with either Con- A (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) or CIAV antigen (whole pure CIAV-A inactivated virus) dissolved inRPMI.
At 5% CO2 tension, the plates were incubated at37°C in a humid environment. All of the wells were ﬁlled with 20 l (5 mg/mL) of MTT (3-[4, 5-Dimethyl thia-zolyl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) solution after72 h, which was added and incubated for another 4 h.The plate was then centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 15 min.All of the wells ’supernatant was delicately removed.DMSO (150 l/well) removed the MTT formazan from the cells.At 510 nm for the test and 650 nm for the refer-ence, the wells ’optical densities ( OD) were measured.Divide the OD value of stimulated by the OD of un-stimulated to get the stimulation index ( SI).Histological Examination Each bird ’s abdominal cavity was opened after it was slaughtered, and its livers and spleens were each given amacroscopic and histological examination.The histologyslide was prepared using the method listed below.Chicken tissue was taken and set in 10% formalin for afull day.
Next, it was successfully dehydrated in risingethanol concentrations, cleaned in xylene, and ﬁnally saturated in paraf ﬁn(Khenenou et al., 2017 ). The blocks were sliced with a microtome to a thickness of 2 mm.Sec- tions were put into a ﬂoating bath that was 37 degrees Celsius.After that, they were adhered to the slides andheated to dry.The sections were stained using the hema-toxylin and eosin procedure ( Khenenou et al., 2013 ).Under a microscope, the microscopic investigation wasclariﬁed and examined.Statistical Analyses The gathered data were statistically estimated with Duncan ’s Multiple Range Test ( Duncan, 1955 ) and the 1-way ANOVA procedure of SPSS (Windows Version ofSPSS, release 16) to determine the signi ﬁcant changes among the means.The model used was: Yij¼mþTiþeij: Where: Y ij= An observation treatment.m= Overall mean.Ti= the i-treatment effect (I =1 —5).eij= The random error.
RESULTS Production Performance In all groups over the investigated experimental peri- ods, except the period (15 −18 wk), the addition of gin- ger or frankincense oil had no impact on the egg-layingrate (%) of laying quail hens ( Table 2 ). The number of eggs was only signi ﬁcantly ( P<0.05) impacted during that time (15 −18 wk).When the hens were 15 to 18 wk old, it was apparent that group 4 had a better EN ( P< 0.05) (0.8 chickens/d) than the other groups ( Table 2 ).Also, the period (15 −18 wk) and the entire time were the only ones where the weight of the egg was signi ﬁ- cantly impacted ( P<0.05).Comparing the group 5 to the other groups, it was found that they had the largest(P<0.05) egg weights (15.23 and 14.71 g, respectively) during 2 time periods (15 −18 and 12 −21 wk of age) (Table 2 ).Only during the interval was egg massIMPACTS OF GINGER AND FRANKINCENSE ON QUAILS 3 considerably ( P<0.05) in ﬂuenced (15 −18 wk).
Accord- ing to the study, group 4 had a higher EM (11.47 g/hen/ d) at 15 to 18 wk of age than other groups ( P<0.05). Table 2 presented that the addition of ginger or frankin- cense oil did not affect feed intake or FCR in all treat-ments during all studies of the experimental periods.Blood Indices Blood Hematological Parameters The data in Table 3 showed that red blood cell and packed cell vol- ume levels were signi ﬁcantly lower in the control diet than in the remaining groups.Group 4 had the highestlevels of red blood cells and packed cell volume ( Table 3 ).On the other hand, white blood cell and hemoglobin lev- els were not signi ﬁcantly impacted ( Table 3 ).Moreover, the data in Table 3 reported that all differential leuko- cytes of layer Japanese quail chickens studied wereaffected using different levels of ginger or frankincenseoil except for monocyte cells.Groups 3 and 4 had thehighest heterophil levels ( P= 0.001) ( Table 3 ).
The results in Table 4 showed that the blood parameters studied (PA, PI%, and LTT) were in ﬂuenced by the addition of various levels of ginger or frankincense oil. The pest values of hematological blood parameterstested were recorded in groups 4, 2, and 5 for PA, PI%,and LTT, respectively.Blood Serum Properties The studied serum parame- ters total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphates,Table 2.Effect of ginger and frankincense oil on production performance of Japanese quail laying hens from 12 to 21 wk of age.

total lipids, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, creati- nine, uric acid, GOT and GPT were not impacted using different levels of ginger or frankincense oil except for alkaline phosphate ( Table 5 ). Compared to other treat- ments, a lower alkaline phosphate level was observed ingroup 5 (frankincense oil 0.40 mg/kg diet).The results presented in Table 5 presented that the tested serum lipids were substantially affected by using dif-ferent diets, including the tested feed additives.The valuesof all studied serum lipid traits were improved using the feed additives during the experiment as the serum lipid val- ues except for high-density lipoprotein (group 2, Ginger0.25 mg/kg) were reduced using the additives in the presenttrait compared to the different groups.
Table 5 displays the impact of ginger and frankincense oil on the levels of creatinine (mg/dL), uric acid (mg/d),glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, U/L), andGlutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT, U/L) in theserum of Japanese laying hens at age 21 wk. The treated birds had lower uric acid levels.The uric acid levels in group 2 and group 4 were the lowest ( P= 0.001).More- over, the therapy group experienced changes in sGPTand sGOT.Group 4 was when serum GPT and GOTwere found to be at their maximum levels (28.67 and20.07, respectively).However, dietary feed additive sup-plements did not impact creatinine levels.The results presented in Table 6 show all antioxidant properties.The highest value s for total antioxidant capac- ity (mmol/L) and serum glutathione peroxidase (mmU/ mL) were recorded in group 5 (frankincense oil 0.40/kgfeed).On the other hand, blood MDA values were signi ﬁ- cantly reduced by using the tested feed additives.

In contrast, histopathology examination of the liver of birds fed ginger powder and frankincense oil at all levels indicates that there was con-gestion of blood vessels, moderate to severe fattychanges, multifocal mild fatty changes and fat cystscompared to the control diets. DISCUSSION Production Performance The results presented in Table 2 showed the impacts of using ginger roots and different grades of frankincenseoil on the number, weight, and mass of eggs laid by lay- ing quail birds.The results showed that adding gingerand frankincense oil to the diets of laying quail birdsimproved various periods of trial egg production charac- teristics.Our results are partly in line with those of El- Kashif and Roshdy (2022) , who found that egg produc- tion and number were considerably ( P≤0.05) greater in treatments receiving feed having various grades of gin-ger root than in the control group.
Along the same lines,egg weight and mass were considerably higher in thesame treatments over 3 age phases and the entire repro-ductive period ( P≤0.05). These ﬁndings concur with those of Abdel-Galil and Mahmoud (2015) , who detected a signi ﬁcant increase in the egg weight, mass and number after ginger was addedto quail feed at rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75%.Also, Figure 1.Histological examination of the spleen after 9 wk from treatments (at 21 wk of age).6 DOSOKY ET AL.Kumar et al.(2019) also established the same ﬁndings when they examined the impact of ginger root powder supplements on leghorn coats at 0.5 and 1%.Moreover, Zomrawi et al.(2014) and Malekizadeh et al.(2012) revealed a reduction in egg weight due to giving gingerroot powder at various grades.Herve et al.(2019) dis- covered that main ginger oil enhanced quail egg weight,likeN/C19u~nez-Torres et al.(2021) , who found an enhance- ment in egg weight after utilizing 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% gin-gerﬂour on laying quails.
Wen et al. (2019) discovered that birds administered ginger extract signi ﬁcantly increased egg mass and weight.According to Akbarian et al.(2014) , a quails-fed diet with 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75% ginger produced eggs of a higher quality.Sittiya et al.(2017) indicated a nonsigni ﬁcant reduc- tion in egg production because of supplementation with dry ginger fermented at 500 ppm.The cause for this advance is that ginger contains major nutrients similarto fatty acids, vitamins, amino acids and minerals, forinstance, selenium, zinc, iron, magnesium, calcium, andvitamins C and E ( Shirin and Jamuna, 2010 ).In addi- tion, ginger too includes a lot of bioactive materials suchas phenols and terpenes.
Phenolic composites have avariety of physiological effects, including antioxidant (Nile and Park, 2015 ), antianxiety ( Vishwakarma et al., 2002), anti-in ﬂammatory ( Zhang et al., 2016 ), antidia- betic ( El-Amin et al., 2006 ), and bene ﬁcial impacts for health by decreasing free radical destruction and Figure 2. Histological examination of the liver after 9 wk from treatments (at 21 wk of age).IMPACTS OF GINGER AND FRANKINCENSE ON QUAILS 7 developing cardiovascular case ( Verma et al., 2004 ), anticancer ( Citronberg et al., 2013 ).Wang and Wang (2005) reported ginger also treats upper respiratory infections.It also signi ﬁcantly improves fertility (Grzanna et al., 2005 ;Manallah, 2012 ).Blood Parameters Results in Table 5 revealed that numerous blood characteristics improved in the dietscontaining various amounts of ginger and frankincenseoil compared to the control group.
According to the cur- rent study ’sﬁndings, the total protein, albumin, and globulin levels were insigni ﬁcant by the diets evaluated. When ginger essential oil was used in laying Japanesequail at rates of 50, 100, and 150 mL/kg, Herve et al.(2019) noticed a signi ﬁcant rise in total protein, albu- min, and globulin.El-Kashef (2022) , who documented ginger usage in male quails ’diets by 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75%, observed the same trend.Also, using ginger reduced serum LDL and total cho- lesterol levels while raising HDL levels across the boardcompared to the control group.Our ﬁndings concur with Salmanzadeh (2015) ,Zewail et al.(2016) ,Swain et al.(2017) ,Herve et al.(2018) ,Herve et al.(2019) , Asghar et al.(2021) ,El-Kashif and Roshdy (2022) all described that ginger signi ﬁcantly reduced total choles- terol, HDL, and LDL.Due to ginger ’s high amount of unsaturated fatty acids, which might increase intestinal cholesterol release, plasma cholesterol levels may havedecreased.
Moreover, triglyceride and cholesterol levelsresponded well to ginger ’s powerful antilipidemia effects (Jang et al., 2007 ). Consequently, it may prevent choles- terol synthesis using substances like hydroxymethylglu-taryl coenzyme A as a mechanism of action ( Saeid et al., 2010), to prevent the creation of cholesterol speci ﬁcally in the liver ( Manju et al., 2006 ).Moreover, Herve et al.(2018) veriﬁed that treated quail had lower MDA serum levels, transaminases, totalcholesterol and triglycerides.In exposed birds used ascontrols, serum levels of total protein, globulin, and anti-oxidant enzymes were higher.Additionally, Herve et al.(2019) obtained that oral administration of 100 or 150 mL/kg body weight of ginger root extracted essen- tial oil for laying Japanese quail resulted in signi ﬁcantly lower cholesterol levels (serum or egg) without any nega-tive consequences.
They also observed that the charac-teristics of serum total cholesterol and LDL weresigniﬁcantly reduced through 100 or 150 mL/kg body weight of ginger root extract essential oil compared tothe control group. According to An et al.(2019) , only the adjusted plasma SOD merit, which lowers the MDA rate of birds, was affected by ginger extract, which did not affect the activity of GSH-PX and TAOC.More-over, ginger extract only favorably increased the lyso-zyme ( LZM ) act and did not change total protein levels, albumin, or serum globulin.Moreover, Ghasemi and Taherpour (2015) noted that mannan-oligosaccha- ride added to diet and ginger main oil (100 mg/kg)reduced cholesterol readings.Histological Examination Results showed that when compared to the control gro up, the birds administered ginger powder and frankincense oil at all levels exhibitedimproved spleen histology.
Th ese results are consistent with those made by Daudu and Mohammed (2020) ,w h o f o u n dt h a ta d d i n gg i n g e rb y - p r o d u c tm e a lt h a th a db e e ntreated with an exogenous enzyme to broiler feed,enhanced the histology of the chickens ’spleens. Moreover, Amer et al.(2023) noted that feeding frankincense oil to broiler chicks signi ﬁcantly increased the immunoexpres- sion of the CD3 and CD20 genes in the spleen.By acti-vating B- and T-lymphocytes and producing IgG and IgM antibodies, frankincense oil supplements help the body ﬁght off bacterial and viral infections ( Al-Yasiry and Kiczorowska, 2016 ).Without a doubt, the bioactive component pro ﬁle of frankincense oil contributes to its immunomodulatory effects.Frankincense oil contains abioactive substance called farnesol that possesses antibio-ﬁlm, fungicidal, antitumor, and anticancer effects ( Wang et al., 2020 ).According to Sachivkina et al.
(2022) ,f a r n e - sol boosted resistance to yeast-like fungi, indicating its antibacterial properties ( Zawrotniak et al., 2019 ). More- over, the manufacturing of prostaglandin, lipoxygenase,and leukotriene is inhibited by sesquiterpene componentssuch as a-farnesene, which modulates the anti-in ﬂamma- tory response ( Miguel, 2010 ).Ginger is an anti-in ﬂammatory that boosts the spleen ’s and immune systems ’function.Ginger can be stated that antioxidants like ginger inhibit the creation of free radi- cals because of the oxidatio n of fatty acids, causation a ﬁnal enhancement in the purpose of the humoral system.This is because ginger comprises antioxidants, which arethought to protect the fatty acids of the humoral immunesystem ( Taghdisi and Hejazi, 2019 ).
Contrarily, compared to the control diets, a closer look at the histology of the liver of the ginger powder and frankincense oil supplementation shows that there was blood vessel congestion, moderate to severe fattychanges, multifocal mild fatty changes, and fat cysts.From these outcomes, it might be concluded that addingginger powder and frankincense oil to quail diets mayharm the liver and should be used cautiously. Theseresults imply that excess consumption of ginger may betoxic to the liver.These outcomes are harmonious with those made by ( Nwaopara et al., 2007 ;Udo-Affah et al., 2014), who found that consuming too much ginger could lead to hepatic necrosis.CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that feeding ginger powder at level 500 mg/kg diet or frankincense oil at level 200 mg/ diet as natural feed additives to Japanese quail lay- ing hens improved their productive and reproductiveperformance and progressed most studied blood serumproperties compared to control birds.
