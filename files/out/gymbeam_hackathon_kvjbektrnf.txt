Keywords Ashwagandha, HepG2, cytotoxicity, antioxidants, apoptosis Date received: 17 August 2017; revised 16 November 2017; accepted: 6 December 2017 Introduction Cancer is a group of heterogeneous heredi- tary disorders that share common alterations in different cellular signalling pathways.1 Apoptosis is one of the main alterationsthat dictate malignant growth. 2Moreover, other characteristics include self-sufﬁciency in growth signalling, alteration of cellular bioenergetics, evasion of immune detection and tissue invasion and metastasis have been described.3,4Genome instability and mutations are essential for tumour progres-sion and facilitate acquisition of these hall- marks.5Coordinated processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apo- ptosis are modiﬁed, producing altered cellular phenotypes with these speciﬁc characteristics.6 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common type of cancer in the world and the second largest contributor tocancer mortality.
7More than 80% of HCC cases around the world occur in sub-Saharan Africa and in Eastern Asia, with typical inci- dence rates of more than 20 per 100 000 indi- viduals.8HCC represents approximately 11.75% of all the gastrointestinal cancers, and about 1.68% of the total malignancies in Egypt.9In Egypt, HCC arises mainly as complications of cirrhosis, which results from hepatitis C virus.10According to the Egyptian National Cancer Institute, HCC is the third most common cancer afterlymphoma in both genders (8.1%), ﬁrst in males (12.1%) and ﬁfth in females (4.0%).11 There are various treatment options for HCC such as curative resection, liver trans-plantation, radiofrequency ablation, transar-terial chemoembolization, radioembolization and systemic targeted agents such as sorafe- nib.
12Although the short-term survival of patients with HCC has improved, these treat- ments have many side-effects, which are toxic and harmful for patients, such as pain,fatigue, emotional distress and anaemia, in addition to their high cost. 13 There is now a trend toward the use of complementary medicines for treating and reducing cancer symptoms and pain.14 Since ancient times, natural products had been utilized as conventional drugs in vari- ous parts of the world including Egypt,China, Greece and India.15These botanical products had been used as prophylactic agents for the treatment of many diseases including cancer, as they have an anticancereffects against different types of cancer.16 These natural products have different mech-anisms of action including the inhibition ofcell progression, alteration of cell differentia- tion and induction of apoptosis.
17 Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera )i san a t - ural herb that has been investigated in a wide range of conditions including muscle strain,18 fatigue,19aches, skin infections, rheumatoid joint inﬂammation20and as an anticancer agent.21,22Recent studies demonstrated thatAhmed et al. 1359 Ashwagandha water extract (ASH-WX) is a powerful antioxidant and it can inhibitcancer cell growth, thus it might be a good example of a natural and economic antican- cer medicine.23,24 The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ASH-WX as an antioxidantand an anticancer agent against HCC.Materials and methods Ashwagandha water extract preparation Egyptian Ashwagandha leaves were collected from Rafah, El-Arish, Egypt in September 2015, as fresh wet leaves, which were thensun-dried, ground and ﬁltered by sievingto get a ﬁne dry powder as previouslydescribed.25ASH-WX was prepared by sus- pending 100 g of dry powder in 1 l of double-distilled water with stirring overnight at 45/C65/C14C.
Then the mixture was ﬁltered under sterile conditions. The sterile ﬁltratewas treated as 100% ASH-WX as previouslydescribed and stored at –20/C14C for future use.26 HepG2 cell culture and treatment with ASH-WX The HCC cell line HepG2 was obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,USA) as described previously.27The cells (1/C2106cells/ml) were then treated with a range of concentrations of ASH-WX (6.25 mg/ml–100 mg/ml) as described below.Cytotoxicity analysis by MTT assay and examination of cell viability The effect of ASH-WX on cell viability was estimated using a3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)assay as described previously.
28Brieﬂy, after maintaining the cells in RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h, the medium of each well wasremoved, the cells were washed twice using 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH7.4) at 25/C14C, and the medium was replaced with 100 mlo fA S H - W Xa ta range of concentrations (6.25 mg/ml– 100 mg/ml). The cells were incubated at 37/C14Ci na5 %C O 2incubator for 24 h.Then, 10 ml MTT solution (5 mg/1 ml of 1.0 M PBS pH 7.4) was added and the cells incubated for 4 h at 37/C14Ci na5 % CO 2incubator.The medium was discarded and each well was supplemented with 100 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide, mixed thoroughly using a pipette, and incubated in a dark room for 2 h.The absorbance of each well was read at 570 nm with a plate reader (SunriseTM; Tecan Group, M €annedorf, Switzerland).GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to calculate the percentage viability and the half-maximal inhibitory concentra- tion (IC 50)o fA S H - W X .
The viability of the cells was determined using an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axio Vert.A1; Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) at 40/C2magniﬁcation after incubation of HepG2 cells with ASH- WX at a range of concentrations (6.25 mg/ml–100 mg/ml) at 37/C14C in a 5% CO 2incubator for 24 h. Assessment of antioxidant activity Antioxidants are synthesized or naturalcompounds that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage.29Total antioxi- dant, glutathione S-transferase and gluta- thione reductase levels were measured in HepG2cells treated with ASH-WX at three concentrations (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/ml) after incubation for 48 h at 37/C14C in a 5% CO 2incubator using color- imetric assay kits (Biodiagnostic, Giza, Egypt) following the manufacturer’s instructions.1360 Journal of International Medical Research 46(4) Assessment of concentrations of FAS-ligand and TNF- a The Fas/Fas-ligand pathway is one of the most important pathways that induce apo-ptosis inside cells.
After incubation ofHepG2 cells with ASH-WX at the IC 50con- centration (5.0 mg/ml) for 48 h at 37/C14Ci na 5% CO 2incubator, the Fas-ligand concen- tration in HepG2 cells was measured using a colorimetric human factor-related apo- ptosis ligand (FAS-L) enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit follow-ing the manufacturer’s instructions (WkeaMed Supplies, Changchun, China). Tumour necrosis factor- a(TNF- a) is one on the most important cell signalling pro- teins (cytokines), which promotes necrosisof some types of tumours and stimulatesthe growth of other types of tumours.30 After incubation of HepG2 cells withASH-WX at the IC 50concentration (5.0mg/ ml) for 48 h at 37/C14Ci na5 %C O 2incubator, human TNF- alevels were measured using an ELISA Kit (K0331131P; KomaBiotech, Seoul, South Korea) following the manufac- turer’s instructions.Assessment of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity Apoptosis is mediated by proteolytic enzymes, called caspases, which trigger celldeath.
Caspase-3 is related to the promo-tion and enhancement of the ‘death cas-cade’ and is therefore considered animportant factor involved in the cell’s entrance into the apoptotic signalling path- way. 31Caspase-8 is involved in apoptosis and cytokine processing.32Caspase-9 is one of the most common caspases, whichis responsible for the activation of othercaspases that result in apoptosis.33After incubation of HepG2 cells with ASH-WXat the IC 50concentration (5.0 mg/ml) for 48 h at 37/C14C in a 5% CO 2incubator, the caspase- 3, -8 and -9 activities were measured usingcolorimetric assay kits (K106-25, K113- 25and K119-25 for caspase-3, -8 and -9, respectively; BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Molecular modelling and docking study Cyclin D1 is one of the most important reg-ulators of cell cycle progression inside the cell.Cyclin D1 over expression has been associated with cancer progression.
34 As the inhibition of cyclin D1 in cancer isconsidered to be one of the most important targeted therapeutic pathways, calculations of molecular modelling and local docking were estimated using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) to evaluate the binding-free energies ofAshwagandha in the cyclin D1 receptor. For the docking calculations, the structure of the target protein cyclin D1 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank ID: 2w96).Based on PyMOL soft- ware calculations, the binding afﬁnity between cyclin D1 and Ashwagandha was calculated using the binding-free energies (S-score, kcal/mol), hydrogen bonds, and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values.The RMSD value is usually used to validate the docking protocol, which provides a method of considering the crystallographic complex protein with a ligand docked within it; the optimized complex protein has the lowest RMSD values.
Cell cycle analysis The HepG2 cells were treated with ASH-WX at the IC 50concentration (5.0 mg/ml) for 24 h at 37/C14C in a 5% CO 2incubator and stained with the CytellTMCell Cycle Kit (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and then analysed using a CytellTMcell imaging system (GE Healthcare Japan).Ahmed et al. 1361 Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSSVRstatistical package, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsVR.Data are presented as mean /C6SD or median (range).Comparison of numerical variables between the study groups was undertaken using Mann– Whitney U-test for independent samples.Two-tailed P-values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Results Figure 1 shows the growth response curve for HepG2 cells following incubation for24 h with a range of concentrations of ASH-WX (6.25 mg/ml–100 mg/ml) as deter- mined using the MTT assay and presentedas the survival fraction of treated cells com-pared with control untreated cells. The IC 50 value of ASH-WX in HepG2 cells wasequivalent to approximately 5.0 mg/ml.At all concentrations of ASH-WX (6.25 mg/ml–100 mg/ml), treated cells showed marked signs of shrinkage andaccumulation of dead cells after 24 h of incubation (Figure 2).In addition, cells appeared to undergo apoptosis comparedwith the control untreated cells.HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of ASH-WX (2.5, 5.0, and10.0 mg/ml) for 48 h demonstrated a signif- icant increase in antioxidant activities com-pared with the control untreated cells(P<0.05 for all comparisons) (Table 1).
The highest activity of total antioxidant (1.8/C60.1mM/ml) was observed when HepG2 cells were treated with 5.0 mg/mlASH-WX, while the highest activity of glu- tathione reductase (80.0 /C66.0 mg/dl) was observed when HepG2cells were treatedwith 10.0 mg/ml of ASH-WX. GlutathioneS-transferase showed the highest activity(1706.7 /C67.3mM/ml) following treatment of HepG2 cells with 5.0 mg/ml ASH-WX.The results of the ELISA analyses showed a signiﬁcant increase in the FAS-L concentration ( P<0.05) and a signiﬁcant decrease in the TNF- aconcentration (P<0.05) of HepG2 cells treated with ASH-WX at the IC 50concentration (5.0 mg/ml) for 48 h compared with the con- trol untreated cells (Figure 3).The results of the caspase colorimetric assays showed signiﬁcant increases in theactivity of the three caspases in HepG2cells treated with ASH-WX at the IC 50con- centration (5.0 mg/ml) for 48 h compared with the control untreated cells ( P<0.05 for all comparisons) (Figure 4).
Molecular docking studies suggested good interactions between the three-dimensional structure of the drug targets(CCND1; Protein Data Bank ID: 2w96) Figure 1.

Discussion Hepatocellular carcinoma receives a great deal of attention from scientists,35,36dueto its late presentation, aggressiveness and poor sensitivity to traditional therapies for cancer,37which, in turn, limits the success of many cancer therapies that are also asso-ciated with many side-effects. 38Some natu- ral products have been used as traditional medicines against various diseases, wherethey have fewer side-effects and have beenshown to act as anticarcinogenic agents.39 Figure 3.The concentration of Fas-ligand (FAS-L) and tumour necrosis factor- a(TNF- a) in HepG2 cells treated with the IC 50concentration (5.0 mg/ml) of Ashwagandha water extract (ASH-WX) at 37/C14Ci na5 % CO 2incubator for 48 h.Data presented as mean /C6SD.* P<0.05 compared with the control untreated cells; Mann–Whitney U-test.Figure 4.

The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.Ahmed et al.1365 This present study investigated the anti- cancer effects of Egyptian Ashwagandha leaves, a well-known herbal medicine that is full of antioxidants, against a HCC cell line HepG2.Previous studies of Ashwagandha leaves found that theirwater extract was effective against many types of cancer.For example, one study found that Ashwagandha leaves activatedtumour suppressor proteins (p53 and pRB) and increased levels of cyclin B1 in cancer cells.25Another study showed an efﬁcient cytotoxic effect of Ashwagandha leaves on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which was stronger than that exerted onPA-1 and A-459 cancer cell lines.
40 The phytochemical analysis of EgyptianAshwagandha leaves suggests that itbelongs to chemotype III, which is different to the Indian Ashwagandha regarding the antioxidant activity. 41,42The results of the current study showed that ASH-WX had a strong cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells.ASH-WX showed a marked effect on thecells causing shrinkage and accumulation of dead HepG2 cells when compared with control untreated cells.This current ﬁndingagreed with previous research that reported a decrease in the viability as well as inhibi- tion of growth of HepG2 cells when treatedof ASH-WX.43The current study of the effect of ASH-WX on total antioxidant, glutathione S-transferase and glutathionereductase activities demonstrated a signiﬁ- cant increase in the activities of these anti- oxidants when the HepG2 cells were treatedwith different concentrations of ASH-WX.
The highest activity of total antioxidant (1.8/C60.1mM/ml) was observed when HepG2 cells were treated with 5.0 mg/ml ASH-WX, while the highest activity of glu- tathione reductase (80.0 /C66.0 mg/dl) was observed when HepG2 cells were treated with 10.0 mg/ml of ASH-WX. Glutathione S-transferase showed the highest activity(1706.7 /C67.3mM/ml) following treatment of HepG2 cells with 5.0 mg/ml ASH-WX.These current ﬁndings were in agreement with a previous study that demonstrated that Ashwagandha was a rich source of powerful antioxidants.44That previous study found an increase in the levels of three natural antioxidants (superoxide dis-mutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxi- dase) when they tested the antioxidant compounds extracted from ASH-WX onrat brains.44Another study conﬁrmed the antioxidant effect of ASH-WX in aging spinal cords of laboratory mice, where itstopped the lipid peroxidation that can lead to heart disease in humans.
45This pre- sent study also showed that ASH-WX sig-niﬁcantly increased apoptotic markers compared with control treatment and these results agreed with a study thatreported an induction of apoptosis, accom- panied by an up-regulation of Bim, t-Bid, caspase-8, caused by withaferin A, the mainactive constituent of ASH-WX. 46Also, the current study showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the concentration of TNF- ain cells treated with ASH-WX compared with con- trol untreated cells.
This current ﬁndings agreed with a report that withaferinA inhibited TNF- aand induced NF- kB activation in endothelial cells treated with the IC 50(0.5mM) dose.47ASH-WX was shown to decrease the proteins or cytokines that are involved in systemic inﬂammation and it also inhibited tumour cell growth.47 The current molecular docking analysis that investigated the interaction between Ashwagandha and cyclin D1, one of themost important regulators of cell cycle pro- gression and its over expression is consid- ered to be a hallmark in various types ofcancer, 48revealed a good and promising interaction between Ashwagandha and cyclin D1;with a score energy of –24.151,hydrogen bond lengths of 2.61A and 2.34A, and the RMSD was less than 1.5A (0.98A).
The current molecular dockingresults were conﬁrmed by the results obtained from cell cycle analysis, which1366 Journal of International Medical Research 46(4) revealed an accumulation of HepG2 cells in the G 0/G1and G 2/M phases and a corre- sponding decrease of HepG2 cells in the<2n phase following treatment with ASH-WX compared with control untreated cells. These ﬁndings agreed with those of a previous study that reported a progressive accumulation of cells in the G 0/G1 phase that correlated with a decrease inthe proportion of cells in the S phase and G 2/M phase in HepG2 cells treated with Ashwagandha extract.49 In conclusion, Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera ) water extract is a powerful anti- oxidant and has anticancer properties in HepG2 cells.It might have potential as a promising anticancer agent against HCC and these results should be conﬁrmed in animal studies.
