Whey protein isolate (WP) is a protein derived from milk that exhibits a wide rangeof bioactivities. Therefore, the present research aimed to delineate the mitigatingimpact of WP against gamma irradiation-induced lingual damage.Methods: Rats were randomized into 5 groups: Control (saline, orally, 14 days), WP (WP; 0.5 g/kg b.w., orally, 14 days), IR (saline, orally, 14 days, exposed to 6 and 3 Gyon days 4 and 6, respectively), WP+IR (WP was given orally for 14 days before andafter IR exposure; exposed to 6 and 3 Gy on days 4 and 6, respectively), and IR+WP(WP, orally, started 24 h after 1 stIR exposure till the end of the experiment) groups.Samples were collected at two-time intervals (on the 7thand 14thdays).Results and Discussion: Oxidative stress was stimulated upon IR exposure in tongue, indicated by boosted malondialdehyde (MDA) level, along with a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities.
Additionally, IR exposure depicted an increase of serumIgE, in ﬂammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α), interleukin (IL)-6, along with overexpression mRNA levels of nuclear factorkappa-B transcription factor/p65 (NF- κB/p65), and down-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 –related factor 2 (NRF2) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) mRNA levels in tongue tissue. Moreover, IR triggered alterations in lingual histologicalarchitecture.

Currently, IR is an important part of several head and neck tumor treatments.This region is an intricate area madeup of various distinctive structures, i ncluding the skin, mucosa, salivary gland, teeth, bone, and cartilage tha t respond to radiation differently, especially in patients who are expo sed to higher doses of IR over large areas ( Pandya et al., 2014 ).It has been associated with several oral adverse consequences, such as xerosto mia, mucositis, taste alteration, and mucosal ulceration ( Deshpande et al., 2018 ).
IR can directly hit DNA or indirectly by increasing the generation of free radicals, i.e., oxidative stress ( Leroi et al., 2016 ;De Ruysscher et al., 2019;Allegra et al., 2020 ). The cytotoxic effects of IR on normal cells are essentially due to the radiolysis of cellular water, leading to instantionization of water molecules, produc ing free radicals including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), such as hydrogenperoxide (H 2O2), superoxide anion (O 2-), hydroxyl radical (OH), and nitric oxide (NO).If not scavenged , this ROS/RNS causes cell injury by triggering mitochondrial perturbati on, lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA s t r a n db r e a k a g e ,p r o t e i nm i s f o l d i n g ,a n d ,e v e n t u a l l y ,a p o p t o s i s( Allegra et al., 2020 ).Furthermore, since oxidative stress and in ﬂammation are strongly related, in ﬂammation is one of the most signi ﬁcant mechanisms that follow IR exposure ( Citrin and Mitchell, 2017 ).
It is anticipated that ROS and DNA damage will initiate an intracellularsignaling cascade and enhance the release of in ﬂammatory mediators (Shanab et al., 2023 ). Therefore, the main approach to radiation mitigation is the scavenging of free radicals and modulation of theinﬂammatory response.The exploration of novel natural radioprotective compounds based o n these mechanisms to withstand I R - i n d u c e dt i s s u ed a m a g ea n dp r o m o t et i s s u er e n e w a li so fu t m o s tinterest.Whey-derived dairy proteins have recently garnered great attention not only for their nutritional bene ﬁts but also for their biological capabilities ( Corrochano et al., 2018 ).Whey protein (WP) isolates are proteins derived from milk following enzymatictreatment or the addition of organic acids or minerals with theprecipitation and removal of casein ( Costa et al., 2021 ).
They serve as an excellent source of proteins, such as lactoglobulin, peptoneprotease, immunoglobulins, albumin, lactalbumin, lactoferrin,lactoperoxidase, bovine serum, and peptides ( Corrochano et al., 2018;Giblin et al., 2019 ). These proteins contain a variety of sulfur- containing amino acids, including valine, isoleucine, and leucine, and branched-chain amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine,which are necessary for tissue growth and repair ( Sukkar andBounous, 2004 ).WPs are known as “fast proteins ”because they do not clot in the stomach ’s acidic environment and can be easily digested and absorbed, especially for cancer IR patients with poordigestive function ( Giblin et al., 2019 ).WP exhibits a wide range of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-in ﬂammatory, antihypertensive ( Pal and Ellis, 2010 ), and immunomodulatory properties ( Giblin et al., 2019 ).
The antioxidant potential of WP is attributed to its role as a precursor for GSH, the body ’s main antioxidant against ROS ( Ali et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, WP exerts an anti-in ﬂammatory effect by inhibiting the pro-in ﬂammatory cytokines and mediators, which may be regulated by the NF- κB signaling pathways ( Ali et al., 2022 ).In line with this af ﬁrmation, it is a worthy point of investigation to assess the radiotoxic effect on the rat tongue and study thepossible radioprotective and mitigating effects of WP.Therefore, asub-lethal dose of irradiation was employed, and evaluation of theserum cytokines, lingual oxidative stress parameters,histomorphology, and mRNA expression of oxidative and pro-inﬂammatory factors was performed in our study.2 Materials and methods 2.1 Whey protein isolate preparation and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy Cow whey protein powder was obtained from the Department of Dairy Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Minia University, Egypt.
WP isolate was prepared as described in Jahovic et al. (2005) .All spectra were obtained using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)spectroscopy ( Singh et al., 2011 ).2.2 Irradiation source and technique The source of radiation was a Gammacell 40 (cesium-137) installed in the National Center for Research and RadiationTechnology (NCRRT), Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, which ensures ahomogeneous distribution of whole-body irradiation.Rats werehoused in cages in the gamma irradiation chamber.Rats wereexposed to 6 and 3 Gy at a dosage rate of 3 Gy/min.2.3 Animals and design of the trial Forty adult male Sprague –Dawley rats (weighing 160 –180 g) were employed in this study.They were obtained from the animal Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Hassan et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1293230 house of the Atomic Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt.
The rats were housed, allowed to acclimatize to the ambient conditions (25°C±2°C), and granted free access to water and a balanced pelleted ratio of 25.8%protein, 62.8% carbohydrates, and 11.4% fat (Wadi Co., Giza, Egypt). As illustrated in Figure 1 , rats were randomized into ﬁve groups, comprising eight rats in each group: 1) in the control group, rats were given saline only by oral gavage, daily throughout the experimentalperiod.2) In the WP group, rats rece ived freshly prepared WP daily at a dose of 0.5 g/kg b.w., orally ( Jahovic et al., 2005 ) for 14 days (days 0 –13).3) In the IR group, animals were ex posed to two doses of whole-body radiation; the ﬁrst irradiation of 6 Gy on day 4 and the second irradiation of 3 Gy on day 6, with a total of 9 Gy accumulative dose, which was determined according to El-Rouby and El-Batouti, (2021) with some modi ﬁcations.
4) In the WP + IR group, rats received a daily dose of WP (0.5 g/kg b.w., orally) for 14 days (days 0 –13), prior and post-irradiation IR exposures. 5) In the IR + WP group, rats receivedWP (0.5 g/kg/day b.w., orally) 24 h after the ﬁrst IR exposure until the end of the experiment.2.4 Specimen collection and processing At the completion of the experiment, the rats were humanely euthanized by giving thiopental so dium (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (Abdelrahman et al., 2020 ).At 24 h after dosing of saline or WP, the samples were collected at two time intervals (on days 7 and 14).Bloodsamples were drawn from the hepatic vein and centrifuged for 15 min at3,000 × g, and the sera were gathered and preserved at −20 °Cf o rf u r t h e r IgE and cytokine analyses.Tongue specimens from each rat were swiftlydissected and washed out using ice-cold physiological saline to get rid ofany clogs and, thereafter, divided into numerous portions.
For histological examination, one portion was preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin (El-Nasr Company for Intermediate Chemicals, Giza, Egypt). Other portions of tissue were stored at −80 °C and further used for estimation of oxidative biomarkers and RNA extraction.2.5 Biochemical index bioassay ELISA kits were used for determining the serum levels of histamine (Cat.No.: K4163, BioVision, Inc.), immunoglobulin E(IgE, Cat.No.: CSB-E07984r, CUSABIO Technology LLC, TX,United States), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α, Cat.No.: MBS175904, MyBioSource, Inc., CA, United States), andinterleukin 6 (IL-6, Cat.No.: R6000B, R&D System, MN, UnitedStates).All procedures were performed as described by themanufacturers.2.6 Evaluation of antioxidants and peroxidation biomarker Malondialdehyde (MDA; an LPO marker) and the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations, along with the FIGURE 1 Experimental protocol.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 03Hassan et al.
10.3389/fphar.2023.1293230 antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)), were assessed in the lingual tissue homogenate, following the manufacturer ’s guide (Laboratory Biodiagnostics, Cairo, Egypt). 2.7 Quantitative real-time PCR Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to determine the mRNA expression of nuclear factor- κB (NF- κB/ p65), erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and heme oxygenase-1(HO-1).In brief, RNA was isolated from the tongue tissue usingTRIzol reagent, following the manufacturer ’s instructions of the RNA Puri ﬁcation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, United States).A NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, United States) was used to measure RNA.Then, RNA extractswith A260/A280 ≥1.8 were reverse-transcribed into cDNA employing a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, United States).The PCR cycle procedures were conducted as described in Habotta et al.(2023) .
The primer sequences and gene accession codes for the evaluation ofNRF2, HO-1, and NF- κB/p65 gene expression levels are listed in Table 1 . The gained data were assessed utilizing the 2 −ΔΔCTmethod.2.8 Histoarchitecture inspection The samples of lingual tissue ﬁxed with formalin were ﬁrst dehydrated in escalating alcohol concentration.Afterward, xyleneclearance was performed before embedding in paraf ﬁn.To examine the histoarchitecture, the tissue was sliced into 5-µm-thick sections,then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and imaged using acamera-integrated digital imaging system (DM300, Leica, Germany).All reagents used for dehydration, paraf ﬁn- embedding, and staining were obtained from LaboratoryBiodiagnostics, Cairo, Egypt.Next, the slides were examined blindly for assessment of the oral damage.
Each examined slide was scored and graded upon the followingcriteria: grade 0 showed normal mucosa with normal papillae, normalsubmucosal glands, and normal stri ated muscle; grade I showed mild degeneration of the ﬁliform papillae with intact root, mild hyperkeratosis, atrophy of taste buds (up to 20% loss of taste cells), fungiform, circumvallate papillae, submucosal edema, and mildsarcoplasmic degeneration of the s triated muscle; grade II showed sloughing roots of ﬁliform papillae, mode rate increase in the previous criteria with 21% –40% loss of the taste cells, edema extended deep to the muscle layer which demonstrated markedatrophy, separation of the muscle ﬁbers, and in ﬁltration of mastcells; grade III showed complete sloughing of the ﬁliform papillae with marked hyperkeratosis, 21% –60% loss of the taste cells, associated fragmentation of the muscle ﬁbers, and an increase in mast cell inﬁltration; grade IV showed marked development of the degenerative and desquamation of the oral ﬁliform papillae and keratin layer, more than 60% loss of taste cells, severe edemaextended between the degene rated and fragmented muscle ﬁbers, and marked in ﬁltration of mast cells.
2.9 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Duncan ’spost hoc test was used to compare the means of the treatment groups. First, all data were tested fornormality (Shapiro –Wilk ’s test; p>0.05) and homogeneity of variances (Levene ’s test; p>0.05) before conducting the ANOVA.All values are deemed statistically signi ﬁcant at p< 0.05 and stipulated as the mean and 95% con ﬁdence interval.Univariate data visualization was done using OriginPro software(version 2019b, OriginLab, MA, United States).The MetaboAnalystprogram was also used to create biological networks, hierarchicalheatmap, and variable importance in projection (VIP) score.3 Results 3.1 FTIR The most prevalent secondary structural components of protein areα-helix and β-sheet, which have been identi ﬁed using FTIR spectroscopy of the whey protein.
The amide-I region of FTIRspectra showed stretching vibrations of C=O and C –N groups and were directly related to protein secondary structures while the region represented C –H bending. The amide-I band (2,130 –2,160 cm −1) was generated ( Figure 2 ).3.2 Effect of WP on the oxidative status in IR-exposed tongue tissue IR-induced oxidative stress in the rat tongue was indicated, as evidenced by a decrease in the CAT and SOD activities andTAC content, along with an increase in MDA levels.Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the degree of IR-induced oxidative damage displayed a time-dependentpattern, and it increased on day 14 compared to day 7.Incontrast, the supplementation of WP improved theTABLE 1 Primers used for qRT-PCR.Gene Forward sequence (5 ′-3′) Reverse sequence (5 ′-3′) Accession No.

Additionally, as shown in Figure 5 , IR exposure evoked a systemic injury, proven by an increase in serum levels ofhistamines, IgE, and cytokines, involving TNF- αand IL-6, in relation to the control and WP groups. These levels signi ﬁcantly increased at day 14 compared to day 7 post-irradiation in a time-dependent pattern.However, the results were reversed in groupsthat received WP, and its administration before IR exposure wascapable of eliciting a stronger anti-in ﬂammatory impact than that of post-IR treatment.According to these ﬁndings, WP might be able to alleviate in ﬂammation including that occurred in the lingual tissue following IR toxicity.3.4 Histoarchitecture ﬁndings The histoarchitecture modi ﬁcation in the lingual tissues following IR exposure and/or WP administ ration was examined in order to emphasize the aforementioned ﬁndings ( Figure 6 ;Figure 7 ;Figure 8 ; Figure 9 ).
As depicted in Figure 6 , the tongue histological examination of the control and WP groups exhibited normal architectures of all tongue papillae. The ﬁliform papillae are cone-shaped and covered by the well-keratinized strati ﬁed squamous epithelium with evident keratohyalin granules in the granular cell layer.The fungiformpapillae are normally mushroom-sha ped with intra-epithelial taste buds on the top.The circumvallate papillae are barrel-shapedand contain taste buds on both sides of the trough.In contrast, theIR-exposed rats exhibited distortion in the histologic appearance of FIGURE 4 Bar plot panel of mRNA expression of antioxidant and in ﬂammation-related genes following IR exposure and/or WP supplementation in lingual tissues.(A)Nuclear factor kappa-B transcription factor/p65, NF- κB/p65; (B)nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, NRF2; (C)heme oxygenase-1, HO-1.Light- and dark-colored columns represent days 7 and 14, respectively, within the same group.

The ﬁliform papillae lost their typical conical shape; however, the taste buds ofthe fungiform and the circumvallate papillae showed little degenerativechanges. Histological alterations of tongue papillae of rats sacri ﬁced 14 days post-RT are depicted in Figure 7 .The IR-exposed animals demonstrated exaggerated effects of irradiation after a longer duration.Filiform papillae appeared necrotic andcompletely sloughed with keratinolysis.Fungiform papillaeshowed marked degeneration of their taste buds withhyperkeratosis of the neighboring epithelium.The cells of tastebuds in the trough of the circumvallate papillae were degeneratedand atrophied.Wide edematous spaces were clearly seen in laminapropria.Mononuclear in ﬂammatory cells, comprised of lymphocytes and macrophages, were observed.WP + IR showeda reduction in tongue tissue distortion to a lesser extent than in ratssubjected to IR only.
Animals of this group showed a signi ﬁcant decrease in oral epithelial tissue injury associated with mild loss oftheir ﬁliform papillae and with apparent intact taste cells of the taste buds within both fungiform and circumvallate papillae. Rats in theIR + WP group exhibited focal sloughing of the ﬁliform papillae and less atrophied taste buds.The sections of the lingual submucosa of the different groups sacriﬁced on day 7 are illustrated in Figure 8 .The control and WP groups showed a normal archite cture.The glands appeared to be composed of normally arranged serous and mucous cells.The serous secretory cells were stai ned deeply with basophilic dyes, while the mucous cells exhibited pale staining with the bubblycytoplasm and basal ﬂat nuclei.The minor glands displayed interlobular ducts with some se rous demilunes that capped mucous acini.The intrinsic striated muscle ﬁbers showed bundles of muscle ﬁbers with peripheral nu clei.
Nerve bundles were found to be composed of nerve ﬁbers with zigzag morphology due to shrinkage during histologic sectionpreparation. The bundles were surrounded by epineurium and separated by connective tissue.In contrast, IR-subjected rats FIGURE 5 Bar plot panel of serum levels of in ﬂammatory markers following IR exposure and/or WP supplementation.(A)Histamine; (B)immunoglobulin E, IgE; (C)tumor necrosis factor- α, TNF- α; and (D)interleukin-6, IL-6.Light- and dark-colored columns represent days 7 and 14, respectively, within the same group.Values are presented as mean ± SE (n = 4 for each time point per group; p<0.05).* IR vs.control group.# WP+IR or IR+WP vs.IR group.$ day 7 vs.day 14 means within the same group.@ WP+IR vs.IR+WP group.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 07Hassan et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1293230 FIGURE 6 Photomicrograph of tongue papillae from different treatment groups of rats sacri ﬁced at 7 days post-irradiation.
Control and WP groups show a gross normal architecture.

However, rats in the WP + IR group depicted a marked decrease in degenerative changes of the serousand mucous glands. The muscle ﬁbers showed focal sarcoplasmic degeneration and decreased edema and mast cell in ﬁltration,alongside mild neuronal vacuola tion.Animals treated with WP after IR revealed focal necrosis of few serous glands, decreasedstagnant mucous within th e mucous acini, moderate degeneration and fragmentation of the muscle ﬁbers, and slight signs of vacuolation and degeneration of the nervebundles with perineural edema.In addition, Figure 9 illustrates the histological changes in lingual submucosa of rats sacri ﬁced on day 14 after IR exposure.The IR group showed severe degeneration and apoptosis of the serous glands.Themucous glands exhibited degenerative changes associated with mucinretention and mononuclear in ﬂammatory cell in ﬁltration.Extensive atrophy of muscle ﬁbers with marked interstitial hemorrhage and mast cell in ﬁltration was observed.
In addition, splitting of the nerve ﬁbers was also noted. Conversely, the WP + IR group demonstrated a FIGURE 7 Photomicrographs of tongue papillae from different treatment groups of rats sacri ﬁced at 14 days post-irradiation.The IR group shows the complete loss of the ﬁliform papillae (white arrowhead) and atrophy of the fungiform papillae with disorganized taste bud cells (black arrowhead).The circumvallate papillae show severe atrophy of their taste buds (white arrow), stagnated excretory duct of the von Ebner salivary gland, and periductal mononuclear inﬂammatory cell in ﬁltration (red arrow).The WP+IR group displays a retained basophilic keratin layer and the conical shape of the ﬁliform papillae (white arrowhead), fungiform papillae with less atrophied taste buds (black arrowhead), and apoptotic cells of taste buds (white arrow).

The tissues with high cellular turnover tend to be the most radiosensitive, especially thetongue, which displays severe mucous membrane damage ( Üstün FIGURE 10 Clustering analysis of whole datasets after IR and/or WP exposure.

Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 12Hassan et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1293230 et al., 2014 ).Many compelling publications have revealed that radiation-caused damage is principally a consequence of complexinteractions among a variety of processes including theoverwhelming production of ROS and in ﬂammatory mediators (Ugurluer et al., 2016 ;De Ruysscher et al., 2019 ;Allegra et al., 2020).Overproduction of ROS causes an imbalance between the cellular pro-oxidants (O 2−,H2O2,O H, and NO) and antioxidant enzymes, thus altering nucleic acid integrity, membrane cohesion,cellular protein, and, ultimately, causing cell death ( Allegra et al., 2020;Abdeen et al., 2021 ;Elgazzar et al., 2022 ).
Herein, our present study elucidated that oxidative stress was crucial in the lingual damage caused by IR, indicated by the declineof the SOD and CAT activities, alongside the TAC level, in thetongue of exposed rats. SOD is an endogenous enzyme serving as the ﬁrst line of defense that swiftly catalyzes the dismutation of O 2−to O2and H 2O2.Thereafter, CAT degrades the generated H 2O2into H2O and O 2.Nevertheless, when CAT is dwindling, an iron- catalyzed Haber –Weiss reaction (H 2O2+F e2+→OH+O H−+ Fe3+) generates extremely harmful reactive OHradicals that can directly damage the membrane lipids, triggering LPO with a furthergeneration of another harmful substance, MDA (an LPO biomarker)(Giuranno et al., 2019 ;Abdelnaby et al., 2022 ).Even worse, MDA itself could interact with other key biomacromolecules, resulting in extensive cellular damage ( Abdelnaby et al., 2022 ).
Current investigation revealed substantial increases in MDA levels,conﬁrming the possibility of membrane insult following IR exposure. Our oxidative stress parameters were comparable withprior investigations that showed that cellular antioxidants weredecreased upon exposure to irradiation ( El-Desouky et al., 2017 ).Additionally, the aforementioned ﬁndings coincide with those of Ugurluer et al.(2016) who con ﬁrmed boosted MDA levels upon IR exposure.Increased LPO corresponded with current lingualhistology showing the degenerative changes within the lingualpapillae and submucosal tissues.Further evidence of the promotion of oxidative damage upon IR exposure in our investigation was the downregulation of NRF2 andHO-1 mRNA transcripts in the tongue tissue.The NRF2 signalingpathway is a well-known key regulator of the cellular detoxi ﬁcation mechanism and the redox condition.It boosts the capacity of cellular antioxidants such as HO-1, CAT, and SOD ( Habotta et al., 2023 ).
Our histological ﬁndings of lingual sections strikingly mirrored these ﬁndings, where they demonstrated exaggerated distortion in the histologic appearance of tongue tissues after days 7 and 14 post-irradiation in a time-dependent pattern. All tongue tissues,including papillae, glands, muscles, and nerves, showed signs ofdegeneration and degeneration and atrophy.In the same vein, Pandya et al.(2014) observed a signi ﬁcantly higher number of apoptotic bodies in irradiated tissue than the control cases.Radiation-provoked oral mucositis is the major drawback of IR of oral malignancy that has an impact on a cancer survivor ’s quality of life ( Pandya et al., 2014 ;Subramaniam and Muthukrishnan, 2019).Since there is ample evidence that oxidative stress and inﬂammation are closely related, we con ﬁrm that the inﬂammatory response is another mechanism triggering harm from IR.
ROS and DNA damage will initiate an intracellular signaling cascade and boost the expression of pro-in ﬂammatory genes, leading to the release of in ﬂammatory mediators, culminating in a profound in ﬂammatory response ( Shanab et al., 2023 ).According to the outcomes of the current investigation, IR signiﬁcantly increases serum levels of IgE, histamine, and pro- inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF- α). Furthermore, NF- κB/ p65 m-RNA gene expression was upregulated.Following exposureto IR, IgE-mediated mast cell activation triggers the production ofhistamine and causes increased expression of histamine and inﬂammatory cytokines ( Landy et al., 2019 ;Tanaka and Furuta, 2021).Histamine serves a crucial role in the local tissue inﬂammatory reaction to IR by increasing NF- κB/p65 activation and in ﬂ ammatory cytokine production ( Landy et al., 2019 ).The NF- κB/p65 pathway is a redox-regulated transcription factor and is essential for the development of mucositis ( Zhang et al., 2021 ).
TNF- αis the most signi ﬁcant in ﬂammatory mediator that triggers the activation of IL-6 and adhesion molecules, which promote the migration of leukocytes into the in ﬂammatory zone ( Ahmed et al., 2022 ). Congruent with this assertion is a study by Citrin and Mitchell (2017) that asserted IR can rapidly escalate inﬂammatory responses via a plethora of cytokines in irradiated tissues.Current histological ﬁndings of lingual tissue vividly corroborated these effects, as elucidated by desquamative lesionsof tongue papillae with substantial mononuclear in ﬂammatory cells and mast cell spillage in IR-injured tongue tissues.Similar results have been reported by Zhang et al.(2021) who found basement membrane disruption, epithelial loss, and ulceration in irradiatedtissue.Xerostomia is the most prominent complication in patients receiving head and neck radiotherapy.Destruction of the salivaryglands and their associated nerves is one of the contributing factorsto IR-triggered xerostomia.
Salivary glands are incredibly vulnerableto radiation; IR causes alteration in the volume of saliva, its consistency, and its pH ( Basu et al., 2012 ). These ﬁndings are reﬂected in the current histological investigation, where the lobules of the salivary glands displayed atrophic changes andtheir ducts and acini were partially blocked by stagnant secretorymaterial, suggesting a potential decline in salivary ﬂow, promoting xerostomia.Moreover, most head and neck cancer patients receiving IR suffer from impaired taste perception and frequently complain of being incapable of tasting their food, decreasing food intake (Deshpande et al., 2018 ).These ﬁndings were con ﬁrmed in our histology as we observed massive atrophy of taste bud cells andnerves.These results agreed with Nguyen et al.(2012) who reported that, within 1 –3 days of irradiation, taste progenitor cells experience cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
This could be explained by the extremeradiosensitivity of the taste buds and taste nerves ( El-Rouby and El- Batouti, 2021 ). WP has been proven to have therapeutic potential, besides being nutritive.It is frequently used in conventional medicine, which isprimarily credited to the biological functions of its bioactive peptides(Zou et al., 2016 ;Pezeshki et al., 2023 ).The peptides surpass the functional attributes of their parent proteins and have been paidgreat attention due to health-promoting bene ﬁts, such as antioxidant, anti-in ﬂammatory, immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and anticancer activities ( Liu et al., 2021 ).As a result, protein-derived bioactive molecules not only help cancer patients satisfy their protein needs but also produce morebiological activities that can help repair damage caused by IR(Liu et al., 2021 ).Accordingly, FTIR spectroscopy of the WP was Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 13Hassan et al.
10.3389/fphar.2023.1293230 done in our study to estimate protein secondary structures. The results revealed that α-helix and β-sheet were the most prevalent secondary structural components of protein.Our results concurwith the information provided by Wang et al.(2019) .E v i d e n c e indicates that α-helices and β-sheet secondary structures are involved in the structure of antioxidant peptides which are crucial for their antioxidant properties ( Zou et al., 2016 ).In the current study, WP consumption weakened IR-induced lingual damage as shown by the noteworthy increase in theantioxidant enzyme activity through upmodulating the expressionof oxidative stress genes (NRF2 and HO-1), along with mitigation ofLPO.Furthermore, our histopathological examination revealed thatWP had a more powerful protective action against IR-induceddamage in the irradiated tongue than using it as a treatment modality after irradiation.
The antioxidant capability of WP is pertaining to its abundance of cysteine (a thiol group-containingamino acid) that combines with glutamate and other amino acids toform GSH. Subsequently, TAC contents are increased, boosting thescavenging of free radicals generated by IR ( El-Desouky et al., 2017 ; Falkowski et al., 2018 ).In addition, the hydrolysis of WP results in the generation of bioactive peptides that have antioxidant properties.Furthermore, the scavenging capacity of tyrosine and cysteine amino acid residues in WP is primarily reliant on proton- coupled single electron or hydrogen atom transfer processes ( El- Desouky et al., 2017 ).In accordance with our data, Giblin et al.(2019) andVeskoukis et al.
(2020) reported that WP boosts the antioxidant pro ﬁle and improves the redox state.In addition, in the current study, WP exhibited potent anti- inﬂammatory effects via restoration of serum levels of histamine, TNF- α, and IL-6, along with downregulation of NF- κB/ p65 expression in tongue tissue. The most active fractions of WPextracts are β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin, which collaborated to increase neutrophils ’sensitivity to a subsequent stimulus ( Rusu et al., 2009 ).WP exhibits anti-in ﬂammatory activities by reducing the expression of the TNF- αgene ( Pal and Ellis, 2010 ).WP has been shown to decrease the in ﬂammatory reaction by constraining the NF-κB/p65 trajectory ( Ali et al., 2022 ).In the same vein, Liu et al.(2021) reported that WP effectively decreased the pro-in ﬂammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the in ﬂammatory reaction.
The present histopathological ﬁndings revealed a decrease in the desquamative lesions and in mast in ﬂammatory cell in ﬁltration in lingual tissues when WP was used in IR-exposed animals, with better amendment of irradiation damage if used before exposure, ina time-dependent pattern. In order to gather the variable contributions in ﬂuenced by various treatments on rat lingual tissue, multivariate statisticalanalysis using the DSPC network, clustering heatmap, and VIPscore was also performed.In addition, histamine on day 14 wasshown to have a more relevant position in the DSPC network and to be positively associated with most of the parameters that were looked at while being negatively correlated with HO-1, CAT,SOD, and TAC on day 7.
The clustering heatmap clearlyillustrates that IR exposure caused substantial changes in alltested parameters compared to other treatment groups, pointing FIGURE 11 Molecular mechanisms underpinning WP capacity to protect against tongue injury caused by IR exposure. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 14Hassan et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1293230 to potential adjustments in such parameters following WP supplementation.NRF2 and HO-1 (days 7 and 14) were also foundto be the top impacting variables in our study according to the VIPscore.The molecular mechanisms underpinning WP capacity to protectagainst tongue injury caused by IR exposure are depicted in Figure 11 .5 Conclusion Gamma irradiation provoked notable harmful effects on the lingual structures of rats caused by oxidative stress and in ﬂammatory reaction in a time-dependent pattern.WP supplementation could abrogate IR-induced lingual tissue damage.
This betterment has been proposed forWP antioxidant and anti-in ﬂammatory properties. When WP was given before irradiation, it resulted in a higher improvement of IR- induced damage than WP given post-exposure.Our ﬁndings advocate the addition of WP to foods of IR-treated cancer patients, owing to itsprotective and remedial effects toward IR-triggered tongue damage.However, further investigations of the current hypothesis areencouraged, particularly in clinical cases.Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material; further inquiries can be directedto the corresponding authors.Ethics statement The experiment was carried out in the animal house at the National Centre for Radiation Research and Technology, Egypt(NCRRT), Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, in accordance with the EthicsCommittee ’s guidelines for using animals in research (Approval No.44A/22).
