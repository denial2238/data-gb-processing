More than 80% of 5 –9 y old children are below recommended intakes of calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A and vitamin D. Although 89% consume dairy products daily, only 3% comply with Pakistan ’s recommended dairy consumption of 2 –3 servings/d.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the theoretical impact of substituting or adding forti ﬁed milk and/or buffalo milk in the diets of Pakistani school-aged children to address nutrient inadequacy.Methods: Dairy consumption and nutrient intakes were calculated using dietary data collected from 5842 children via a 24-h diet recall in the School-age Children Health and Nutrition Survey conducted in Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan between 2019 and 2020.
Givendaily intakes documented in the School-age Children Health and Nutrition Survey, 2 modeling scenarios were applied to test the impact onnutrient intakes of 1) substituting current milk (buffalo, cow, and goat) consumption (volume by volume) with a forti ﬁed milk beverage and 2) adding a forti ﬁed milk beverage or buffalo milk to current consumption to meet dairy consumption recommendations. Results: The hypothetical substitution of current milk consumption with forti ﬁed milk lowered nutrient inadequacies for vitamin C (by 86%), vitamin A (by 45%), thiamin (by 26%), ribo ﬂavin (by 14%), vitamin B6 (by 13%), calcium (by 8%), and iron (by 7%), compared to baseline (relative percent reduction).
Among children consuming <2 dairy servings/d, theoretically adding buffalo milk had a positive contribution to calcium, phosphorous, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, ribo ﬂavin, niacin, and folate; theoretically adding forti ﬁed milk addi- tionally reduced inadequacies of iron, thiamin, vitamin B6, and greatly reduced vitamin C inadequacy.Conclusions: Buffalo milk and forti ﬁed milk each have their own value in closing nutrient gaps. Increasing their consumption can be integrated into a multi-pronged public health strategy (including forti ﬁed foods, ensuring food security, and diet diversity) to tackle nutrient inadequacies in children.Keywords : diet modeling, nutrient inadequacy, dairy, milk, school-aged children, Pakistan Introduction Nutrition is a key enabler to promote children ’s ability to grow, learn, and develop to their full potential.Food securityand diet diversity matter to ensure children are providedwith adequate nutrient intake.
As de ﬁned by the WHO,malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition, inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, andresulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases [ 1]. Therefore, promoting nutritional solutions to ensure nutrientadequacy for children ’s development is key.Among solutions to prevent risk of malnutrition, food forti ﬁcation is generally Abbreviations: AMDR, acceptable macronutrient distribution range; EAR, estimated average requirements; RNI, reference nutrient intake; %E, percent of energy.* Corresponding author.E-mail address: myriam.afeichezehil@rd.nestle.com (M.C.Afeiche).journal homepage: https://cdn.nutrition.org/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdnut.2024.104435 Received 19 December 2022; Received in revised form 23 July 2024; Accepted 26 July 2024; Available online 8 August 2024 2475-2991/ ©2024 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of American Society for Nutrition.

The diet of Pakistani school-age children in Sindh and Punjab provinces is characterized by the consumption of dairy (mostcommonly milk tea with sugar), bread, sweets, french fries andchips, solid fats, and low consumption of fruits, vegetables, and meats [ 3,4].In addition, 68% of households have a high dietary diversity (de ﬁned by the consumption of /C216 food groups in the last 24 h).Only 47% of households in these provinces are foodsecure.Thus, inadequate micronutrient intakes are prevalent:>75% of children are below the calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A, and folate recommended intakes.
Regarding macronutrients,around 60% of children have inadequate protein intake [lowerthan the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR)],around 30% above the AMDR for total fat, whereas most childrenare within carbohydrate recommendations [ 3,4]. Milk is a reliable and effective vehicle for forti ﬁcation pur- poses due to its widespread consumption and accessibility as a staple in diets, and its consumption is recommended in food-based dietary guidelines [ 5].The complexity and nutritional stability of milk make it an ideal vehicle for providing micro-nutrients that can improve the nutritional quality of diets andthus support normal healthy growth and development in chil-dren [ 6].Although milk is a good source of calcium and protein, it contains very little iron.Forti ﬁed milk, on the contrary, is enriched with additional vitamins and minerals and can thus be avehicle for missing or inadequate nutrients.
Several observa-tional studies and randomized controlled trials found that the consumption of forti ﬁed milk-based beverages compared to un- fortiﬁed milk enhanced nutrient intake (such as iron and vitamin D) in children aged 1 y old and above [ 7,8]. Diet modeling is a valuable tool to assess the theoretical nutritional impact of howchanges to the amounts or types of foods and beverages in adietary pattern might impact meeting nutrient needs [ 9].In line with this, the Irish dietary guidelines, for example, identi ﬁed that forti ﬁed milk contributed to ensuring iron adequacy in toddlers using diet modeling [ 10].In this article, we examined how buffalo milk, the most commonly consumed milk in Pakistani school-age children, and fortiﬁed milk may contribute to alleviating inadequate nutrient intakes that are key for children ’s development.
For this, we used diet modeling to ﬁrst evaluate the theoretical impact of 1) substituting current milk consumption (volume by volume) witha forti ﬁed milk beverage and 2) adding either buffalo milk or a fortiﬁed milk beverage to current intake to meet dairy con- sumption recommendations. Methods Study population The School-age Children Health and Nutrition Survey is a cross-sectional multi-stage household survey conducted over a 6-mo period between 2019 and 2020 in the Sindh and Punjabprovinces of Pakistan [ 3,4].The survey was commissioned by the Ministries of Health in collaboration with the Trust for Vaccines and Immunizations and Aga Khan University.Demographic, household dietary diversity, child general health, anthropom-etry, and dietary assessment were collected using structuredquestionnaires in 5900 school-aged children (5 –<10 y).Further details of the survey and data collection have been previouslypublished [ 4,5].
Secondary data analysis was conducted using all data from this study. Written consent was obtained from thehead of the household prior to data collection, and informedverbal consent was obtained from the children.Dietary assessment and data processing A single multi-pass 24-h diet recall was conducted face-to- face and assessed details of products consumed, their in- gredients, and quantity (using standardized utensils such as cups, spoons, bowls, and glasses).Although a second 24 h recall wasinitially planned, it was not carried out due to the COVID-19pandemic.Children and their caregivers completed the recalltogether.Details have been described previously [ 3,4].Brie ﬂy, foods consumed were converted to nutrient intakes using a foodcomposition database developed for Pakistan in a separate studycalled “Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric In- fections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Healthand Development (MAL-ED) ”[11].
The MAL-ED database considered the oil forti ﬁcation with vitamin A but recognized that quality controls suggested variability in content and levels of fortiﬁcation [ 12,13]. Thus, oil was considered unforti ﬁed with vitamin A.Wheat ﬂour was considered unforti ﬁed as the na- tional forti ﬁcation program was only limited to a few districts in Punjab and was stopped prior to the School-age Children Healthand Nutrition Survey.In addition to total energy, analyzed nu-trients in the current survey included protein, carbohydrates,total fat, SFA, MUFA, PUFA, calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc,vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin C, thiamin, ribo ﬂavin, niacin, vitamin B6, and folate.The food composition tables available forlocal foods did not include vitamin B12 estimates, so vitamin B12 was not part of this study.
The nutrient values were summed up at the child level to calculate the intake per child per day.Outliers in energy intakes were identi ﬁed as above or below 3 standard deviations (SD) of the energy intakes mean in each 1-yage increment (5 y, 6 y, 7 y, 8 y, and 9 y old). From the initial5900 children in the study [ 3,4], 58 were excluded due to out- liers in energy intake.The ﬁnal sample size was 5842 children.Dairy consumption was calculated as the sum of milk (including tea with milk), milkshakes, dairy desserts/custards(such as kheer, sweet vermicelli), yogurt (including lassi), andice cream as per the FAO Pakistan dietary guidelines [ 14].The number of servings of dairy products consumed by each child was calculated to determine adherence to the 2 –3 recommended servings of dairy per day, with 1 serving of milk being 250 g[14].Children who consumed no dairy, or <2 servings/d, were considered not meeting the dairy recommendations.
Two typesof dairy products were evaluated in the modeling scenarios:buffalo milk (commonly consumed by Pakistani children, eitheralone or in a sweetened tea beverage) and a reconstituted forti-ﬁed milk powder (referred to as “fortiﬁed milk ”from hereon). It is also called ﬁlled milk and contains vegetable oils and essential nutrients, including calcium, iron, vitamin A, vitamin C, andvitamin D.Modeling scenarios Two dietary modeling scenarios (substitution and addition) were applied.In the ﬁrst scenario, we assessed the theoretical impact of substituting current milk consumption with forti ﬁed milk among milk consumers ( n¼4950).In this scenario, we excluded the 89 children ( n¼1.5%) already consuming forti ﬁedM.C.Afeiche et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 8 (2024) 104435 2 milk, resulting in an analytical sample of 4861 children in the substitution scenario.
In the second scenario, we evaluated thetheoretical impact of adding either buffalo milk or forti ﬁed milk to the diets of children consuming less than the dairy recom-mended consumption per day (2 servings/d) ( n¼5673). Spe- ciﬁcally, current dairy consumption was theoretically topped up with buffalo milk or forti ﬁed milk to meet Pakistani recom- mendations of /C212 dairy servings per day.For example, in chil- dren consuming <0.5 servings/d, we added 2 servings of milk; in children consuming 0.5 –0.9 servings/d, we added 1.5 servings of milk; in children consuming 1 –1.4 servings/d, we added 1 serving of milk; and in children consuming 1.5 –1.9 servings/d, we added 0.5 serving of milk.To address the concern that it maynot be feasible/realistic for all families to add /C202 servings of milk per day, we conducted a third analysis, where we added /C201 serving/d of milk to children with dairy consumption <2 serv- ings/d.
Mean intake and dietary inadequacy were computed before and after modeling scenarios. Results in the text are expressed as relative percent reductions.The composition ofbuffalo milk and forti ﬁed milk used in the modeling scenarios are reported in Supplemental Table 1 .Data analyses The estimated energy requirements were calculated using the FAO human energy requirements for children of different agesand sex for moderate physical activity [ 15].For all nutrients (except iron and zinc), the 2019 United States dietary reference intakes were used to establish adherence to nutrient recom-mendations [ 16] because estimated average requirements (EAR) have not been developed for Pakistan.Previous studies inPakistan have used similar EARs [ 3,4].Children with intake below the EAR for a given nutrient were considered inadequate.For iron and zinc, the WHO EARs were used to account for thelow red meat consumption in Pakistani children and, thus, lowiron and zinc bioavailability in their diet.
EARs for iron and zincwere calculated by dividing the WHO Reference Nutrient Intake(RNI) [ 17] by conversion factors given in WHO/FAO guidelines on food forti ﬁcation with micronutrients [ 18]. For an iron bioavailability of 5%, the WHO RNI is 12.6 mg/d for ages 5 –8y and 17.8 mg/d for age 9 y.Inadequate iron intake was calculatedusing the full probability method [ 19].The EAR for zinc was calculated by dividing the WHO RNI for low zinc bioavailabilityby the conversion factor.For ages 5 –8 y: 9.6/1.2 ¼8.0 mg/d; and for age 9 y: 11.2/1.2 ¼9.3 mg/d.Given that only 1 d of dietarydata was collected, we used the National Cancer Institute SIMPLE macro to adjust for within-person variation to estimateusual intakes and inadequate intakes [ 20].
Because of the crucial role of selecting an accurate external variance ratio in analyzingsingle-day data [ 20], we conducted sensitivity analyses with several variance ratios (ranging from 0.2 to 0.9) on the prevalence of inadequate intakes for 3 selected nutrients (Supplemental Table 2 ). These external variance ratios were selected according to 1) a database of publications and rean- alyzed datasets (by choosing age groups closest to 5 –9 y and South East Asian countries) and 2) a recommendation to test a range of values from “0.5 to 0.9, or wider, for populations >1yo f age”[21].Results Sample characteristics A total of 5842 children were included in this study.Description of the study population has been previously reported elsewhere [ 3,4].Although 89.5% of children ( n¼5231) consumed dairy products, the mean amount consumed per day(150.7 g/d) was <1 serving (250 g/d) ( Table 1 ).
The percentage of children classi ﬁed as dairy consumers did not differ signi ﬁ- cantly between weekends (89.1%) and weekdays (89.8%), P¼ 0.39. The most consumed dairy product was milk (84.7%, n¼ 4950 children), followed by yogurt (16.9%), ice cream (3.7%),dairy desserts (2.0%), and milkshakes (1.5%).Only 3% of chil-dren adhered to Pakistan dairy recommendations of more orequal to 2 servings/d, 17.8% consumed between 1 –1.9 ser- vings/d, and 68.7% <1 servings/d (results not shown).The main nutrient inadequacies were vitamin D, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin C [ 3,4].
Substitution scenario Among children consuming milk and excluding children already consuming forti ﬁed milk ( n¼4861 children, 83.1%), substituting current milk consumption with forti ﬁed milk did not signiﬁcantly in ﬂuence carbohydrate intake (99% compared with 98% of children within the AMDR), but slightly reduced thepercent children within the AMDR for protein intake (43%compared with 37% of children within the AMDR) and increasedthe percent children within the AMDR for fat (62% comparedwith 74%) ( Table 2 ). The hypothetical substitution of forti ﬁed milk instead of milk had the largest impact on lowering nutrient TABLE 1 Dairy consumption in 5 –9 y old Pakistani children ( n¼5842) from the School-age Children Health and Nutrition Survey.

For phosphorus,however, the percentage of milk consumers with inadequate intakes increased by 24% after the theoretical substitution withfortiﬁed milk. Addition scenario of ≤2 servings/d in children not meeting dairy recommendations Among children consuming <2 servings of dairy per day (97%, n¼5673), with the addition of either forti ﬁed milk or buffalo milk, mean energy intakes theoretically increased by 18% and 32%, respectively, and most micronutrient intakes(except vitamin D) were brought closer to the EARs compared tobaseline ( Table 3 ).The hypothetical addition of buffalo milk contributed to better macronutrient balance [as a percentage ofenergy (%E)] for protein.Speci ﬁcally, adding buffalo milk increased the percentage of children within AMDR for proteinfrom 44% at baseline to 99% compared with 67% when addingfortiﬁed milk.
However, buffalo milk notably increased the percentage of children above AMDR for fat (from 38% to 100%),whereas forti ﬁed milk only slightly increased the percentage of children above the AMDR for fat (from 38% to 49%). Theoreti- cally, adding buffalo milk had a positive contribution to reducinginadequacies for ribo ﬂavin (by 100%), vitamin A (by 92%), calcium (by 82%), phosphorous (by 80%), niacin (32%), folate(by 19%), vitamin C (by 16%) and zinc (by 4%) ( Figure 2 ).TABLE 2 Mean nutrient intakes and inadequacy at baseline and after substitution, in Pakistani children aged 5 –9y( n¼4861) from the School-age Children Health and Nutrition Survey.

Addition scenario of ≤1 serving/d in children not meeting dairy recommendations To address the concern that it may not be feasible/realistic for all children to increase milk consumption by 2 servings/d, we restricted the analysis to add /C201 serving/ d of either forti ﬁed milk or buffalo milk in children with dairy consumption <2 servings/d (97%, n¼5673) ( Supplemental Table 3 ). A better macronutrient distribution for protein was achieved with theaddition of buffalo milk compared to forti ﬁed milk and baseline (89%, 56%, and 44% within the AMDR, respectively).Similar tothe addition scenario of /C202 servings/d, the theoretical addition of/C201 serving/d led to a better fat intake as %E for forti ﬁed milk (57% with AMDR) compared with buffalo milk (6% within theAMDR) and comparable to baseline (62% within AMDR).
Theoretically, adding buffalo milk had a positive contribution to reducing inadequacies for ribo ﬂavin (by 99%), vitamin A (by 65%), niacin (19%), phosphorous (by 16%), folate (by 10%), andcalcium (by 8%). Forti ﬁed milk reduced nutrient inadequacies for ribo ﬂavin (by 79%), vitamin A (by 64%), niacin (8%), phosphorous (by 1%), folate (by 2%), and calcium (by 1%).However, theoretically, adding forti ﬁed milk furthermore reduced inadequate intakes of vitamin C (by 90%), thiamin (by45%), vitamin B6 (by 26%), and iron (by 2%).Sensitivity analyses to assess the prevalence of inadequate intakes using different variance ratios For calcium, percent inadequate intakes ranged from 85% for a variance ratio of 0.2 –98% for a variance of 0.9 ( Supplemental Table 2 ).For vitamin C, the percentage of inadequate intakes ranged from 23% for a variance ratio of 0.2 to 1% for a varianceratio of 0.9.
Finally, for iron, inadequate intakes were quite stable: 75% for a variance ratio of 0.2 to 73% for a variance ratio of 0.9. The external variance ratio estimate chosen for all nu-trients in Tables 2 and 3 was 0.73.It was selected from a data- base of publications and reanalyzed datasets by choosing agegroups closest to 5 –9 y and the geographical proximity of Bangladesh.Discussion The present study explored the theoretical impact of 1) substituting current milk consumption with forti ﬁed milk and 2) adding forti ﬁed milk or buffalo milk to reach the 2 servings/ d dairy recommendations on nutrient intakes and adequacy inPakistani school-aged children.The hypothetical substitution ofcurrent milk consumption with forti ﬁed milk increased energy and macronutrient intakes and lowered nutrient inadequacies forvitamin C, vitamin A, iron, calcium, and B vitamins, compared tobaseline.
In children consuming <2 dairy servings per day, the addition of forti ﬁed milk contributed to better macronutrient balance (as %E) for fat but not protein as compared to buffalomilk. Theoretically, adding buffalo milk had a larger contribution to phosphorous, calcium, folate, and zinc compared to forti ﬁed milk.Whereas the theoretical addition of forti ﬁed milk to current dairy consumption had larger reductions in vitamin C, iron,thiamin, and vitamin B6 inadequacies.Thus, buffalo milk andfortiﬁed milk each had their own value in closing different nutrient gaps.Although most children included in this diet modeling study consumed dairy products (89.5%), a large majority (97%) didnot meet the dairy recommendations of 2 servings/ d.Milk wascommonly consumed (by ~85% of children), but the meanamount consumed per day was low, less than half a serving per day (110 g/d).Similarly, for yogurt, the mean intake was equivalent to less than one- ﬁfth of a standard yogurt serving size (26.5g/d).
Overall, we found that adding milk-based products tothe diet of these school-aged children would make a signi ﬁcant contribution to improving their intake of micronutrients FIGURE 2. Percent of children 5 –9 y old consuming <2 servings/d of dairy with inadequate nutrient intakes before and after the addition of /C202 portions of forti ﬁed milk or 2 portions of buffalo milk from the School-age Children Health and Nutrition Survey in Pakistan ( n¼5673).M.C.Afeiche et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 8 (2024) 104435 6 crucially meaningful for their growth and development, including the normal function of their immune system (e.g.,folate, iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitaminD), normal cognitive functions (e.g., iron, zinc), and normal bonegrowth and development (e.g., calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus,and protein).However, macronutrients were not yet fully balanced, and inadequate nutrient intakes were still high even after substitution or addition scenarios.
Thus, increasing milkconsumption could be one of the strategies to tackle nutrientinadequacies among Pakistani school-aged children. In Punjab,44.3% of households are food insecure, and 62.6% in Sindh [ 3, 4].Thus, a multi-pronged public health plan is needed and could include the consumption of other forti ﬁed foods, improving household food security, and ensuring diet diversity, in line withthe Pakistan multi-sectoral nutrition strategy 2018 –2025 [ 22].The development of a school health and nutrition program in thecountry could be a vehicle for this strategy.This strategy can be exempli ﬁed with vitamin D and iron.
Mean intakes of vitamin D more than doubled (from 1 μg/d to 2.1μg/d in the substitution scenario and from 1.0 μg/d to 2.8 μg / di nt h ea d d i t i o ns c e n a r i ow i t hf o r t i ﬁed milk); however, virtually all children (100%) remained below the EAR, sug-gesting that even among children consuming milk, adequateintakes in vitamin D are dif ﬁcult to reach without further di- etary intervention. It should be, however, noted that the contribution to overall vitamin D concentrations, i.e., alsoincluding endogenous synthesis through sun exposure, is nottaken into account.It is highly acknowledged that the preva- lence of vitamin D de ﬁciency is usually high in the pediatric (and adult) population of developing countries [ 23].A recent review indicated that 64.6% of healthy individuals in Pakistanhad vitamin D concentrations <30 ng/mL [ 24].
Likewise, the 2018 Pakistan National Nutrition Survey (2018) found a highprevalence (62.7%) of vitamin D de ﬁciency among children below the age of 5, with a signi ﬁcant proportion of them (13.2%) having a severe de ﬁciency [ 25]. Other studies con- d u c t e di nP a k i s t a nh a v er e p o r t e dah i g hp r e v a l e n c eo fv i t a m i nDdeﬁciency in neonates (46 –75%), infants (61%), toddlers, and preschool children (17 –73%) [ 23,26–28].Based on these ﬁndings, a “nature and nurture ”strategy (i.e., sunlight exposure and supplementation) has been proposed [ 29].Iron intake in Pakistan has a low bioavailability, as red meat c o n s u m p t i o ni nc h i l d r e ni sl o w[ 3,4].Other than chicken and eggs, the main source of iron is from plant-based foods such aslentils, split peas, and chickpeas.
Consumption of a forti ﬁed milk beverage would typically help to reduce inadequate in-takes of nutrients that are not typically found in buffalo, cow,and goat milk regularly consumed by children in Pakistan, suchas iron, vitamin C, vitamin D, and some B vitamins which arekey nutrients of concern in this population, offering an alter- native to those not consuming milk and dairy on a regular basis. In addition, vitamin C consumption would increase the ab-sorption of iron.Although wheat ﬂour has been forti ﬁed with iron and folic acid in Pakistan since 2011 [ 22], consumption of meat and meat products, which have a higher iron and zincbioavailability, could be encouraged in accordance with Pak-istani dietary guidelines [ 14].
The current study used dietary modeling to test the impact of meeting dairy recommendations to reduce nutrient inadequacy.Like for any dietary modeling study, the data are to beinterpreted with caution because they represent a best-case scenario, assuming all children would comply with the recom-mendations with no compensation or adjustment to the rest ofthe diet. Another limitation is the use of a single 24 h recall toclassify children as dairy consumers compared with non-consumers.However, most children in Pakistan consume dairy products, and the percentage consuming dairy did not signi ﬁ- cantly differ by weekend compared with weekday.Thus, we donot expect a within-person variation of dairy by day of the week.Because a single 24 h recall was collected, an external varianceratio had to be selected to calculate the usual intake.
Althoughwe conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness ofusual nutrient intake distributions and inadequate intake prev-alence, it is important to acknowledge that a degree of uncer-tainty could have been introduced that could have affected theaccuracy of results. Finally, given the limitations of back-calculating the EAR from the WHO RNIs [ 30], the use of different nutrient reference values may lead to differences in the interpretation of nutrient inadequacy.However, the choice ofdietary reference intakes for iron and zinc was thoroughlyinvestigated during the data analysis phase according to thediffering bioavailability of these nutrients in the diet of Pakistanichildren.The strengths of this modeling exercise include theavailability of a recent and large sample of dietary intake dataspeciﬁc to school-aged children in Pakistan and the calculation of usual intake using one 24 h recall.
Lastly, the scenarios areplausible given that the price of forti ﬁed milk is comparable to that of buffalo and cow milk. In conclusion, both buffalo and forti ﬁed milk have their own value in closing nutrient gaps.Increasing the consumption ofmilk among school-aged children should be encouraged toreduce nutrient inadequacy as part of a multi-pronged publichealth strategy.This strategy could be implemented within aschool health and nutrition program in the country and wouldadditionally include the consumption of other forti ﬁed foods, improving household food securi ty, and ensuring diet diversity to tackle nutrient inadequacies among Pakistani school-aged children.Acknowledgments We thank the School-age Children Health and Nutrition Sur- vey investigators for access to the study data.We also thank Arjumand Rizvi for database veri ﬁcations and Natacha Rupp and Elias Mardhy for their helpful support ensuring study datamanagement and quality.
