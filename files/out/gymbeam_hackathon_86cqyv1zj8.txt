Nutrient Physiology, Metabolism, and Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions Whey Protein-Enriched and Carbohydrate-Rich Breakfasts Attenuate Insulinemic Responses to an ad libitum Lunch Relative to ExtendedMorning Fasting: A Randomized Crossover Trial Harry A.Smith, Jonathan D.Watkins, Jean-Philippe Walhin, Javier T.Gonzalez, Dylan Thompson, James A.Betts* Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism, Department for Health, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom ABSTRACT Background: Typical breakfast foods are rich in carbohydrate, so they not only elevate blood glucose during the morning, but also elicit a second-meal effect that can attenuate blood glucose responses in the afternoon.
Objectives: To determine whether a reduced-carbohydrate protein-enriched breakfast can elicit similar effects on glucose control later in the day but without hyperglycemia in the morning.Methods: In a randomized crossover design, 12 healthy men and women (age 22 /C62 y, BMI 24.1 /C63.6 kg ⋅m /C02; Mean /C6SD) completed 3 experimental conditions. In all conditions, participants consumed an ad libitum lunch at 1200 /C61 h but differed in terms of whether they had fasted all morning (control) or had consumed a standardized porridge breakfast at 0900 /C61 h (320 /C650 kcal; prescribed relative to resting metabolic rate) that was either carbohydrate-rich (50 /C610 g CHO) or protein-enriched (that is, isoenergetic substitution of car- bohydrate for 15 g whey protein isolate).Results: The protein-enriched breakfast reduced the morning glycemic response (iAUC 87 /C636 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min) relative to the carbohydrate-rich breakfast (119 /C637 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P¼0.03).
Despite similar energy intake at lunch in all 3 conditions (protein- enriched 769 /C6278 kcal; carbohydrate-rich 753 /C6223 kcal; fasting 790 /C6227 kcal), postlunch insulinemic responses were markedly attenuated when breakfasts had been consumed that were either protein-enriched (18.0 /C68.0 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min; P¼0.05) or carbohydrate-rich (16.0 /C67.7 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min; P¼0.005), relative to when lunch was consumed in an overnight fasted state (26.9 /C613.5 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min). Conclusions: Breakfast consumption attenuates insulinemic responses to a subsequent meal, achieved with consumption of energy-matched breakfasts typically high in carbohydrates or enriched with whey protein isolate relative to extended morning fasting.Trial registration number: NCT03866720 ( clinicaltrials.gov ).
Keywords : sugar, metabolism, thermogenesis, energy balance, protein Introduction Breakfast habits exhibit low day-to-day variability (that is, we typically consume similar foods upon waking every day). Dietarysurveys from various countries indicate that breakfast is consis-tently rich in carbohydrates but provides less than half the pro-tein of other daily meals [ 1–4].Nutritional interventions targeting breakfast therefore present an opportunity to in ﬂuence nutrient intake recurrently and therefore to modify overall di-etary pro ﬁle, with the added potential for carry-over effects fromthatﬁrst meal on subsequent metabolic and behavioral responses later each day.The acute effects of common breakfast foods relative to morning fasting are well established.Extending the overnightfast results in incomplete compensation of energy intake duringan ad libitum lunch, such that total energy intake tends to behigher when breakfast is consumed [ 5–9].
However, while typical carbohydrate-rich breakfasts can result in acute hyper-glycemia during the morning, this can be balanced againstimproved glucose control in the afternoon relative to when Abbreviations: iAUC, incremental area under the curve; RER, respiratory exchange ratio; tAUC, total area under the curve; TSRA, Time-Series Response Analyser. * Corresponding author.E-mail address: J.Betts@bath.ac.uk (J.A.Betts).journal homepage: https://jn.nutrition.org/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2023.08.008 Received 12 October 2022; Received in revised form 24 July 2023; Accepted 4 August 2023; Available online 7 August 2023 0022-3166/ ©2023 American Society for Nutrition.Published by Elsevier Inc.All rights reserved.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2842 –2853 breakfast has been omitted (that is, the “second-meal effect ”;[5, 6]).
Considering that most humans in middle –high income countries spend the majority of waking hours in the postprandialstate [ 10] and that the mean amplitude of postprandial glycemic and insulinemic excursions are associated with in ﬂammation and cardiometabolic disease risk, strategies to mitigate such perturbations are desirable (for example, diet) [ 11–14]. It remains unclear whether a carbohydrate-rich breakfast and/or acute hyperglycemia in the morning are necessary toelicit the second-meal effect.In particular, there are severalprotein-mediated mechanisms leading to the hypothesis thatsubstituting a portion of the carbohydrate typically consumed atbreakfast for added whey protein may elicit similar, greater,and/or additional metabolic effects.
Firstly, from a metaboliccontrol perspective, co-ingestion of carbohydrate with addedprotein results in delayed gastric emptying along with a larger,more protracted insulin response [ 15,16], thus exerting lasting effects on both glucose appearance and disposal [ 17,18] that may carry over to improve glucose tolerance at subsequent meals[19,20]. Secondly, from an energy balance perspective, protein has a greater effect on diet-induced thermogenesis than otherdietary macronutrients and so may increase metabolic re-quirements over the morning, potentially contributing towardweight-loss in the longer term [ 21–23].Finally, from a behav- ioral perspective, the physical and chemical properties of proteindirectly exert a more satiating effect than other dietary macro-nutrients, so they may help with appetite control at subsequentmeals [ 24,25].Previous studies have begun to examine the above hypotheses but with equivocal results.Allerton et al.
[ 26] reported no effect of added protein at breakfast on postlunch glycemia, althoughthe breakfasts in that study varied not just in macronutrientcomposition but also energy content [ 26]. Conversely, Meng et al.[ 14] did demonstrate attenuated glycemic responses to a subsequent meal following earlier ingestion of protein, althoughthe metabolic response to the initial meal was not characterizedin that study.Similarly, there is also no consensus regarding theeffects of added protein at breakfast on appetite regulation.Somestudies have demonstrated greater appetite suppression and/or lower energy intake at lunch following a protein-rich breakfast [27–29], whereas others have not [ 30,31].The aim of this study was therefore to isolate the metabolic effects of protein at breakfast by comparing isoenergeticcarbohydrate-rich and protein-enriched breakfasts relative toextended morning fasting as a control condition.
Primaryoutcome measures will be the glucose and insulin responses toboth breakfast and lunch; secondary outcomes included energyintake (appetite) and expenditure (substrate oxidation). It washypothesized that the reduced-carbohydrate protein-enrichedbreakfast would attenuate glycemic responses to breakfast and lunch, with greater satiation and thermogenesis than the other conditions.Methods Approach to the research question The type of protein under investigation (whey protein isolate) was selected on the basis that our hypothesis is related to insulin-mediated mechanisms [ 32]; whey (especially isolate) exhibits a relatively short gastric emptying time and thus rapidhyperaminoacidemia, with potent effects on both insulin secre- tion [ 33,34] and diet-induced thermogenesis [ 35] and was therefore deemed appropriate to enrich the breakfast meal onthis basis.
The dose of protein selected for investigation (15 g)was based on robust evidence from acute laboratory trials ofdose–response effects of whey protein on energy intake later the same day. Speci ﬁcally, the addition of 15 g of protein to an already protein-rich meal reduces energy intake at the next meal,such that the protein added at breakfast is more than fullycompensated for by reduced energy/protein intake at the nextmeal alone [ 25].Furthermore, based on data from NHANES [ 1], an additional 15 g of protein at breakfast would be appropriate toachieve a more even distribution of protein intake across the day(that is, the protein content of daily meals is typically ~10 g atbreakfast, ~20 g at lunch and ~35 g at dinner).The above type and dose of protein was included within a typical breakfast food (porridge) that delivered carbohydrate in proportion to the individual resting metabolic requirements measured at each participant ’sﬁrst visit to the laboratory.
Spe- ciﬁcally, the target rate of carbohydrate delivery (7.3 mg ⋅kJ RMR /C01) has been used in previous studies in our laboratory on the basis that it provides a suf ﬁcient metabolic challenge for the assessment of glucose tolerance. Within the context of the pre-sent study, this was also appropriate as the unforti ﬁed porridge condition would not then deliver an excessive amount of protein.Furthermore, the chosen carbohydrate delivery rate also resultsin a total breakfast energy content that meets the commonlyreported threshold de ﬁnition that breakfast should constitute /C2120% of daily energy intake [ 36].Importantly, standardization of breakfast quantity to RMR re ﬂects energy requirements during the trial (that is, rested in bed) while also accounting for RMR asa primary driver of energy intake [ 6,37].The lunch meal was also based on previous work by Chowdhury et al.
[ 5,6], the composition and dose of which (pasta —see below) again was selected on the basis that it would provide a suf ﬁcient challenge to glycemic control to meaningfully compare postprandialresponses. Experimental design Participants underwent 3 trials in a randomized crossover design with a minimum washout interval of 4 d between trials(12/C610 d; range 4 –47 d).A randomized crossover design was employed so that each participant could serve as their owncontrol, thus removing between-subject variance from the pri- mary analysis.Trial sequence was strati ﬁed based on partici- pants biological sex and habitual breakfast habit ( >209 kJ [ >50 kcal] intake within 2 h of waking on /C214 d/wk [ 38,39]) and was not counter-balanced.Diet was recorded for 48 h prior to par-ticipants ’ﬁrst visit to the laboratory and replicated before sub- sequent visits.
Participants were asked to refrain from strenuousphysical activity, caffeine, and alcohol for 24 h before each trial,conﬁrmed by a questionnaire upon entering the laboratory. Broadly, laboratory visits involved consumption of either aporridge breakfast (with or without substitution of oats for wheyprotein) or extended morning fasting, before an ad libitum pasta lunch.Eligible participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 trial orders, according to a plan with a block size of 6 generated usingwww.randomization.com .This was generated by an individual independent to the research team, who also assigned participantsto the trial sequence.Participant trial-order allocation wasH.A.Smith et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2842 –2853 2843 revealed to the primary investigator 1 d prior to each partici- pant’sﬁrst trial.
Participants were not informed of the trial order until completion of their ﬁnal trial upon which they were pro- vided with an exit questionnaire to ascertain their ability tocorrectly distinguish between the 2 breakfast consumingconditions. Participants Twelve healthy men and women participated in the study (Table 1 ).Recruitment occurred between February 2021 and February 2022.Exclusion criteria included body mass indexoutside of the range of 18 ⋅5–29 ⋅9k g ⋅m /C02, any diagnosed meta- bolic disease (for example, type 1 or type 2 diabetes), and anyreported use of substances or behaviors (for example, nonstan-dard sleep –wake cycle, shift workers) that may pose undue personal risk or introduce bias into the experiment.All partici-pants were informed of any potential risks and discomfortinvolved in the study prior to providing written and oralinformed consent.
The study was given a favorable ethicalopinion by the Research Ethics Approval Committee for Health at the University of Bath (EP 17/18 260) and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03866720). All procedures were per- formed at the University of Bath resting physiology laboratory atthe University of Bath and were carried out in accordance withthe Declaration of Helsinki.Experimental protocol Participants arrived at the laboratory at 0800 /C61 h following an overnight fast of /C2110 h and voided prior to assessment of body mass (Tanita-BC543, Japan) and waist:hip circumferenceratio (SECA).In accordance with best practice for measuringRMR, participants rested in a semisupine position (~60 /C14) prior to the collection of expired breath samples via the Douglas bagmethod [ 40].An intravenous cannula was placed in an ante- cubital vein and a baseline 10-mL sample of blood was drawn (BD Ven ﬂon Pro).Cannulae were kept patent by ﬂushing with 0.9% sodium chloride infusion (B.Braun).
Participants theneither ingested 1 of the 2 porridge breakfasts or remained in anovernight fasted state, initiating the beginning of the 180-minmorning period with their ﬁrst mouthful. Further blood sam- ples (10 mL) were drawn every 15, 30, and 60 min for the ﬁrst-, second- and third-hours, respectively, alongside hourly expiredgas samples and visual analog scales.Upon completion of thepostbreakfast phase, participants were then provided with an adlibitum lunch over a 30-min duration.Blood samples werecollected every 15 and 30 min for the ﬁrst- and second-hourspostlunch, respectively, alongside hourly expired gas and vi- sual analog scales ( Figure 1 ).Breakfast Breakfast meals were isoenergetic and consisted of boiling water added to instant porridge oats (Quaker), either unforti-ﬁed/standard (carbohydrate-rich) or forti ﬁed with whey protein isolate (protein-enriched; MyProtein, Northwich, UK).
Thecarbohydrate-rich breakfast provided 7.3 mg of carbohydrateper kJ of each individual ’s RMR. In the protein-enriched break- fast, substitution of 18.3 g of whey protein isolate powder (thatis, 15 g whey protein) into the porridge resulted in a carbohy-drate delivery of 5.73 /C60.13 mg CHO ⋅kJ /C01RMR.The difference in macronutrient compositions of the breakfasts is reported inTable 2 .During the extended morning fast, only plain water was permitted across the morning (standardized across trials) until the ad libitum lunch in the extended morning fast condition.Thecomparative overnight fasting period between the breakfast andfasting trials was therefore /C2110 h and /C2114 h, respectively.Ad libitum lunch The lunch meal consisted of penne pasta (Sainsbury ’s, UK; per 100 g: carbohydrate 32.3 g, fat 0.7 g, protein 5.2 g) includingtomato and herb Bolognese sauce (Sainsbury ’s, UK; per 100 g: carbohydrate 6.2 g, fat <0.5 g, protein 1.3 g); prepared at a ratio of 1:1 uncooked mass.
Each pasta meal was prepared accordingto standardized cooking times (20 min), with the energy densityof the cooked pasta calculated (to account for any differences inwater absorption) and the ﬁnal masses of pasta and sauce com- bined noted, to calculate the energy density for the homoge-neous mixture of pasta and sauce. The nutritional information forthe lunch meal is reported in Table 3 .Pasta meals were prepared the night before each trial and were heated in a microwave at700 W for 5 min prior to serving to participants.The pasta mealwas provided in a large bowl that was replenished every 10 min or when participants were close to ﬁnishing to minimize visual feedback relating to consumed volume and to prevent any ten-dency to ﬁnish the portion provided.Participants were asked to eat until “comfortably full ”[5,6,41] and were otherwise left alone during the lunch.
Ad libitum water intake was permittedduring participant ’sﬁrst trial, and this volume was replicated upon subsequent visits. Blood analysis Blood samples were immediately transferred into tubes treated with EDTA or clotting activators (plasma and serum, TABLE 1 Participant characteristics (mean /C6SD,n¼12).Characteristics Combined Male ( n¼8) Female ( n¼4) Age (y) 22 /C622 3 /C632 1 /C62 Body mass (kg) 75.7 /C611.2 80.2 /C611.0 66.7 /C67.2 Height (m) 1.77 /C60.08 1.81 /C60.05 1.69 /C60.01 BMI (kg ⋅m/C02) 24.1 /C63.6 24.5 /C63.3 23.3 /C62.6 Waist:Hip 0.78 /C60.05 0.80 /C60.05 0.74 /C60.04 RMR (kcal ⋅d/C01) 1851 /C6241 1960 /C6253 1634 /C6208 Habitual breakfast consumers1(n)11 8 3 1Habitual breakfast consumption de ﬁned as >209 kJ ( >50 kcal) intake within 2 h of waking on /C214 d/wk [ 38,39].FIGURE 1.Schematic representation of the study protocol.H.A.Smith et al.

Plasma samples were analyzed for glucose (intra-assay CV: 2.3 /C6 1.7%; interassay CV: 2.9 /C61.7%), NEFA (intra-assay CV: 13.6 /C6 6.2%; interassay CV: 8.2 /C62.5%), and urea (intra-assay CV: 1.68 þ0.1%; interassay CV: 4.1 /C60.1%) using a spectrophotometric analyzer (RX, Daytona, Randox Laboratories Ltd).Plasma insulinwas measured by commercially available ELISA (Mercodia,intra-assay CV: 8.9 /C69.8%; interassay CV: 4.6 /C64.9%).Incre- mental area under the curve (iAUC), peak concentration (mmol ⋅L /C01), and time to peak (minutes) were calculated using the Time-Series Response Analyser (TSRA) tool [ 42].
Expired gas analysis Expired gases were collected using 150 L Douglas bags, with concentrations of O 2and CO 2analyzed in a known volume of sample, using paramagnetic and infrared analyzers, respectively(Mini HF 5200; Servomex Group Ltd.). These analyzers were alsoused to determine the composition of inspired air to adjust forvariation in atmospheric O 2and CO 2concentrations [ 43].Total volumes of expired gas were determined using a dry gas meter(Harvard Apparatus) and temperature measured using a digital thermometer (Edale Instruments,).Substrate utilization was determined using the equations of Frayn [ 44].Diet-induced thermogenesis was calculated as the difference in increment inenergy expenditure (kcal ⋅min /C01) between the extended morning fasting trial and each of the fed trials (that is, carbohydrate-richand protein-enriched), thus controlling for the in ﬂuence of circadian variation in RMR on the thermic effect of feeding [ 45].
iAUC was then calculated from these values using the TSRA [ 42]. Appetite ratings Paper-based visual analog scales with 100-mm horizontal axes were employed to assess subjective appetite.Participantsmarked their response to questions assessing their hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and prospective consumption.Each scale pre-sented a question (for example, “How hungry do you feel?”), which participants answered by placing a vertical line on eachscale to denote their perception relative to the extremes (forexample, “not at all hungry ”compared with “as hungry as I have ever felt ”).From these questions, a composite appetite score was calculated using the following equation: Composite Appetite ¼((Hunger þProspective consumption) þ(100 /C0fullness) þ(100/C0satisfaction))/ 4 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism (Prism 9, GraphPad Software).The distribution of paired differences wasassessed using the Shapiro –Wilk test.
The separate research questions concerning the postbreakfast and postlunch phaseswere addressed by applying a separate 2-way condition /C2time repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to the morning and postlunch phases, respectively. The Greenhouse –Geisser correction was adopted for epsilon (a measure of sphericity)<0.75 and the Huynh –Feldt correction adopted for less severe asphericity.Interaction effects were then followed up withRyan –Holm –Bonferroni stepwise correction to adjust the result- ingPvalues for multiple comparisons and thus avoid in ﬂation of type I error rate (Ludbrook, 2000; Atkinson, 2002).Simple con-trasts among conditions (that is, without time-series data) such asthe energy intake data and iAUC data were analyzed using 1-wayrepeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc t-tests employed to identify the location of variance among the 3 conditions.In text values are reported as mean /C6SD unless otherwise stated.
Error values on ﬁgures are normalized con ﬁdence in- tervals corrected for between-participant variation (SPSS, IBMv28 and Microsoft Excel v16.0.13801.21072). This correction issuch that the magnitude of these con ﬁdence intervals infers the contrast between paired means at each time point rather than thevariance of individual values around each mean [ 46].Using this approach, nonoverlapping intervals between contrasted valueswould typically be deemed signi ﬁcantly different according to conventional null hypothesis testing (that is, P/C200.05).Given the crossover design, the potential for trial-order effects was examined by analyzing the iAUC or total area under the curve (tAUC), peak, and time-to-peak data of participants ’ﬁrst, second, and third laboratory visits using a 1-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA; if a signi ﬁcant effect of trial sequence was identi ﬁed then a follow-up 2-way condition /C2sequence repeated measures ANOVA was performed [ 47,48]—none was present.
Based on a postlunch difference in insulin iAUC of 24.3 /C6 20.7 nmol ⋅L /C01⋅180 min in previous work contrasting the meta- bolic responses to a subsequent meal following breakfast or anextended overnight fast, 15 participants were deemed suf ﬁcient to achieve >90% power with an alpha level of 0.05 among groups (G*Power 3.1) [ 6].

Peak glucose was similar among carbohydrate-rich and protein-enriched breakfasts ( P¼0.27).As such, morning iAUC for glucose was higher following both carbohydrate-rich (119/C636 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P<0.0001), and protein- enriched (87.7 /C636.0 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P¼0.001) break- fasts compared with extended morning fasting (22.9 /C624.4 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min) ( Figure 2 B).Notably, plasma glucose iAUC was also higher following ingestion of the carbohydrate-richcompared with protein-enriched breakfast ( P¼0.03).Postlunch Neither breakfast consumption nor composition in ﬂuenced plasma glucose across the afternoon (condition /C2time P¼0.16).
However, peak plasma glucose concentration was lowerfollowing ingestion of the carbohydrate-rich breakfast (7.76 /C6 0.97 mmol ⋅L /C01;P¼0.01) relative to the extended morning fast condition (8.76 /C61.35 mmol ⋅L/C01), which was similar to peak glucose following the protein-enriched breakfast (8.08 /C60.93 mmol ⋅L/C01;P¼0.09). Time to postlunch peak glucose was similar among conditions ( P¼0.44).Postlunch plasma glucose iAUC was similar between carbohydrate-rich (179 /C692 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min; P¼0.10), and protein-enriched (211 /C684 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min; P¼0.43) breakfasts relative to extended morning fasting (234/C6112 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min) ( Figure 2 C).Postlunch plasma glucose iAUC was also similar following carbohydrate-rich andprotein-enriched breakfasts ( P¼0.19).
Postprandial insulin Morning Regardless of composition, breakfast ingestion elicited a similar increase in insulin concentrations across the morningsuch that peak insulin was higher following carbohydrate-rich(326/C6180 pmol ⋅L /C01;P¼0.0002) and protein-enriched (362/C6135 pmol ⋅L/C01;P<0.001) breakfasts relative to extended morning fasting (32 /C611 pmol ⋅L/C01)(Figure 3 A). Plasma insulin iAUC was also then higher across the morning in both thecarbohydrate-rich (14.2 /C67.9 nmol ⋅L /C01⋅180 min; P¼0.0002) and protein-enriched (16.3 /C65.9 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P<0.001) conditions compared with extended morning fasting (0.5 /C60.7 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min) with no difference between the 2 breakfasts (P¼0.06) ( Figure 3 B).
Postlunch Postlunch peak insulin was lower following both the carbohydrate-rich (225 /C682 pmol ⋅L/C01;P¼0.01) and protein- enriched (228 /C675 pmol ⋅L/C01;P¼0.01) breakfast conditions relative to the extended morning fast condition (403 /C6215 pmol ⋅L/C01) but was similar between each breakfast condition ( P¼ 0.81). Time to postlunch peak insulin was similar among con-ditions ( P¼0.19).Postlunch plasma insulin iAUC was lower following both carbohydrate-rich (16.0 /C67.7 nmol ⋅L /C01⋅120 min; P¼0.005) and protein-enriched (18.0 /C68.0 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min; P¼0.05) breakfasts compared with extended morning fasting (26.9/C613.5 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min) ( Figure 3 C).Postlunch plasma insulin iAUC was similar between the carbohydrate-rich andprotein-enriched breakfasts ( P¼0.12).
Postprandial NEFA Morning Ingestion of breakfast suppressed plasma NEFA across the morning to a similar extent among carbohydrate-rich and protein-enriched breakfasts in contrast to the gradual increase observedwith extended morning fasting (condition x time P¼0.006; Figure 4 A). Consequently, tAUC ( Figure 4 B) for NEFA across the morning was lower following both the carbohydrate-rich (28.8 /C6 16.6 mmol ⋅L /C01⋅180 min; P¼0.02) and protein-enriched (24.6 /C6 10.6 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P¼0.003) breakfasts relative to the extended morning fasting (55.9 /C626.9 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min).tAUC was similar between breakfasts ( P¼0.38).FIGURE 2.Plasma glucose responses across the trial duration (A) time course plasma glucose responses.The dashed vertical line denotes the end of the breakfast [B] phase and start of the lunch [L] phase.(B) Morning incremental area under the curve (iAUC).(C) Postlunch incremental area under the curve (iAUC).Data are means /C6normalized CI.

As such, tAUC for NEFA following lunch was similarfollowing extended morning fasting (16.5 /C67.6 mmol ⋅L /C01⋅120 min) compared with both the carbohydrate-rich (23.9 /C629.2 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P¼0.45) and protein-enriched (18.3 /C611.8 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅180 min; P¼0.58) breakfasts ( Figure 4 C). Likewise, postlunch tAUC was similar between carbohydrate-rich andprotein-enriched breakfasts ( P¼0.56).Postprandial urea Breakfast composition altered the late morning plasma urea response (condition /C2time P¼0.05).Whereas concentrationsremained relatively stable following the protein-enriched breakfast and during the extended morning fast, plasma ureaconcentration gradually decreased in the second hour of themorning phase following the carbohydrate-rich breakfast suchthat plasma concentration was lower than the protein-enrichedbreakfast at 120 min ( Figure 5 ).Despite this, tAUC for plasma urea was similar among conditions ( P¼0.10).

Postlunch Energy expenditure was similar at the prelunch baseline among all 3 conditions. Following the lunch meal, energyexpenditure increased to a similar extent in all conditions andremained similar across all postlunch time points ( Figure 6 A).RER was similar at the prelunch baseline among all 3 conditions.Following the lunch meal, RER increased to a similar extent in allconditions and remained similar across all postlunch time points(Figure 6 C).Subjective appetite Morning Composite appetite fell comparably following consumption of the carbohydrate-rich and protein-enriched breakfasts ( Figure 7 A).Conversely, subjective appetite gradually increased across themorning during the extended morning fast (condition /C2time P< 0.001).
tAUC for composite appetite across the morning wastherefore higher following extended morning fasting (44,534 /C6 9680 mm ⋅180 min) compared with both the carbohydrate-rich (28,242 /C69867 mm ⋅180 min; P<0.001) and protein-enriched (28,416 /C69204 mm ⋅180 min; P<0.001) breakfasts. Postlunch Following ingestion of the lunch meal, composite appetite was suppressed in all conditions before gradually increasingthroughout the postlunch phase.Postlunch appetite values were similar at each time point (all P>0.05) such that tAUC was also similar among conditions ( P¼0.72).
Energy intake During the 2 breakfast conditions, participants consumed a prescribed breakfast of 1337 /C6211 kJ (320 /C650 kcal) (that is, variance proportionate to interindividual differences in RMR).Energy intake during the ad libitum lunch was not different be-tween conditions, with participants consuming 3305 /C6948 kJ (790/C6227 kcal) following the extended morning fast compared with 3149 /C6931 kJ (753 /C6223 kcal) following the carbohydrate-rich breakfast ( P¼0.50) and 3217 /C61157 kJ (769 /C6278 kcal) following the protein-enriched breakfast ( P¼0.75, Figure 7 B). As such, total energy intake across the trial was lower in extended morning fasting condition (3306 /C6948 kJ [790 /C6 227 kcal]) relative to both the carbohydrate-rich (4486 /C61003 kJ [1072 /C6240 kcal]; P¼0.001) and protein-enriched (4555 /C6 1217 kJ [1088 /C6291 kcal]; P¼0.002) breakfasts, respectively.
Combined morning and postlunch responses Plasma glucose iAUC across the laboratory visit (that is, morning and postlunch) was similar ( P¼0.27) for extended morning fasting (257 /C6110 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min), carbohydrate- rich breakfast (299 /C699 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min), and protein- enriched breakfast (299 /C6110 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min; Figure 8 A). Likewise, combined morning and afternoon plasma insulin iAUCwas similar ( P¼0.14) between extended morning fasting (27.4 /C613.4 nmol ⋅L /C01⋅300 min), carbohydrate-rich (30.2 /C614,159 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min), and protein-enriched breakfasts (34.3 /C6 13.3 nmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min) ( Figure 8 B).Finally, combined NEFA tAUC was also similar ( P¼0.15) regardless of extended morning fasting (72 /C633 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min), carbohydrate-rich break- fast (53 /C644 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min), or protein-enriched breakfast (43/C621 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅300 min; Figure 8 C).
Order effects Repeated measures 1-way ANOVA revealed an effect of trial sequence on postlunch glucose iAUC ( P¼0.04) whereby, at the group level, iAUC was higher in the ﬁrst trial (248.3 /C6107.1 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min) relative to the second (192.0 /C693.6 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min; P¼0.05) and third (185.3 /C684.2 mmol ⋅L/C01⋅120 min mmol; P¼0.04) trials, respectively. How- ever, no Sequence /C2Condition interactions in postlunch plasma glucose iAUC responses were evident ( P¼0.16).Discussion The present study revealed that ingestion of breakfast, as opposed to extended morning fasting, can attenuate the post-prandial insulin response to lunch.This observation wasconsistent irrespective of whether a typical carbohydrate-richbreakfast was ingested or a reduced-carbohydrate, protein-enriched breakfast was ingested.Despite a lower glycemic response to the protein-enriched breakfast, the second-meal effect was nonetheless effectivelystimulated.
Although glycemic responses to the ad libitum lunchmeal were similar among all conditions, consumption of eitherbreakfast attenuated the insulinemic responses to lunch.

The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2842 –2853 2848 Increases in circulating insulin (and subsequent suppression of plasma NEFA concentrations) following an initial meal primesthe pancreas and metabolic tissues in preparation for a subse-quent meal [ 32,49–51] and therefore could represent an important metabolic signal in broad alignment with waking tomaintain glucose homeostasis throughout the day [ 52]. This is especially pertinent considering the robust effects of insulinupon the circadian clock in the peripheral tissues that deal withingested nutrients [ 53,54].Interestingly, this second-meal response following either breakfast occurred despite differingpostprandial metabolic responses between the 2 isoenergetic breakfasts; ingestion of the protein-enriched breakfast reduced postprandial glycemia and accentuated the early phase insulinresponse relative to the carbohydrate-rich breakfast.
This isconsistent with previous research demonstrating acutely atten- uated postprandial glycemia with higher protein meals [ 35,55, 56] and is likely explained by dietary protein-induced stimula- tion of glucagon and insulin to maintain euglycemia [ 57], as well as the direct reduction in carbohydrate dose [ 58]. Although previous work investigating the effects of breakfast per se on sequential meal metabolism demonstrated a distinctsecond-meal effect for glucose that was not apparent in thecurrent study [ 5,6], this could be explained by differences in population age between our study and Chowdhury et al.[ 5,6], whereby the glucose concentrations are more tightly regulated in younger healthier populations relative to individuals with overweight or obesity [ 5,6,41].Finally, total glycemic and insulinemic responses across the day were similar, which is FIGURE 6.Respiratory data collected from Douglas bags across the trial duration.

[ 34] investigated the effects of a large dose of nocturnal (0400 h)protein on next meal (that is, breakfast) glycemic control.Nocturnal feeding of protein resulted in worsened glycemiccontrol at breakfast, which is most likely explained by the largedose of protein ingested (~75 g) [ 59] but may be due to feeding at a time misaligned from typical rhythms [ 60]. In the current study, the initial feed was broadly aligned with the commencement ofthe typical active/light phase for humans.Consequently, break-fast was consumed at a time during which the body is typically more insulin sensitive and anticipating energy intake [ 61–64].Aside from the smaller dose of protein used in the current study(~25 g) in contrast to that used by Smith et al.[ 34], these data could suggest that the time of day during which the initial meal isfed may also in ﬂuence the second-meal response.
Omission of breakfast resulted in a gradual increase in circu- lating NEFA concentrations across the morning, whereas ingestionof either breakfast resulted in a similar degree of NEFA suppression(Figure 3 C). This is consistent with the possibility that NEFA exposure is a key mechanism of the second-meal effect, and/or thatinsulin priming reaches a threshold whereby further insulin has no further priming effect.This was expected given the established effects of fasting and insulin upon secretion of NEFA from adiposetissue to fuel metabolism [ 65].Conversely, ingestion of breakfast resulted in a similar suppression of NEFA, regardless of the wheyprotein content of the breakfast meal.Considering the acutedetrimental in ﬂuence of NEFA upon insulin action in healthy populations [ 66–69], it is plausible that the elevation in NEFA during an extended morning fast contributes to the exaggeratedinsulin and/or glucose response following the lunchtime meal.
Appetite ratings following ingestion of breakfast were similar regardless of protein content. This is perhaps surprising given the established satiating effects of isoenergetic protein relative to carbohydrate but is consistent with previous breakfast literature[26].Conversely, subjective appetite rose across the morning during the extended morning fast —consistent with previous literature [ 5,6,26].Despite differences in appetite between breakfast omission and consumption (regardless of composi-tion), energy intake during the ad libitum lunch was almostidentical among all conditions such that total morning energy intake (that is, breakfast þlunch) was higher.A lack of differ- ence in energy intake between carbohydrate-rich and wheyprotein-enriched breakfasts may be explained by the time be- tween breakfast and lunch ingestion.
Although the 3-h post- prandial phase following breakfast ingestion is more re ﬂective of free-living conditions, this duration may have been too long forthe previously established effects of protein content of a preloadon ad libitum energy intake to carry-over. Astbury et al.[ 25] observed a clear dose –response effect of a protein preload on energy intake during a subsequent meal 90 min later, which ishalf the postprandial duration of this study.Chungchunlam et al.[70] also reported an effect of whey protein on energy intake relative to other preloads regardless of whether this was 30, 90,or 120 min before assessing energy intake; however, this is still at least 1 h shorter than the postbreakfast phase in the current study during which time the effects of added protein on appetitemay have deteriorated.Despite differing in protein content, the thermic effect of food did not differ between breakfasts.
Energy expenditure increased toa similar extent following ingestion of breakfast while remainingstable across the morning in the extended morning fasting con-dition. The thermic effect of feeding was similar between trials(~19 compared with ~24 kcal ⋅180 min in the carbohydrate-rich and protein-enriched conditions, respectively).The value for thecarbohydrate breakfast is at the lower end of the ranges of values reported by Westerterp et al.[ 21] (carbohydrate: 5% –10%, fat 0%–3%, protein 20% –30%).The measured increase in thermo- genesis after the protein-enriched breakfast is lower than even thebottom end of this range [ 21].This is surprising given that whey protein appears to have a relatively higher thermic effect offeeding relative to casein and soy [ 35].Ingestion of breakfast meals differing in protein and carbo- hydrate content following an overnight fast resulted in similarmetabolic substrate oxidation.
Speci ﬁcally, RER increased in response to both breakfasts, re ﬂective of an increase in carbo- hydrate oxidation, before gradually decreasing across the morning. In contrast, substrate selection did not vary across the morning during the extended morning fasting, re ﬂecting a greater contribution of lipids to fuel metabolism during this time[44].No difference was observed in RER postlunch; however, the pattern of response is interesting to note between the 3conditions.Although RER peaked 60 min postlunch at the grouplevel, RER continued to increase through to 120 min postlunch in FIGURE 8.Combined morning and afternoon incremental area under the curve (iAUC) data for (A) plasma glucose and (B) plasma insulin.Combined morning and afternoon total area under the curve data for (C) plasma NEFA.Means /C6normalized CI.B ¼breakfast; L ¼Lunch; 1-way repeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc t-tests employed to identify the location of variance among the 3 conditions.n¼12 for all ﬁgures.H.A.
Smith et al. The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2842 –2853 2850 both the extended morning fast and protein-enriched conditions.Although the lack of difference in postbreakfast plasma urea isinitially surprising given the difference in protein content be-tween the 2 breakfasts, data from Witard et al.[ 71] suggest that protein oxidation (and therefore plasma urea concentrations) isunlikely to differ between breakfasts containing 10 compared with 20 g and may only increase when protein is fed in doses above 40 g.However, the lack of difference in plasma urea maytherefore suggest that protein oxidation is not contributing to-ward any differences in RER across the postbreakfast phase,although urine was not collected in the current study so couldnot be analyzed for urea to conclusively state this.The current study population only included healthy young adults, with no history of metabolic dysfunction.
With greaterunderstanding of the acute metabolic effects of such breakfastsrelative to extended morning fasting future work should inves-tigate metabolic responses to these breakfasts in individuals with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. The effects of different forms of protein must also be considered wherebyslower digesting proteins (for example, casein) and naturallyhigh protein foods (for example, milk/meat) would likely resultin a lower insulin response and perhaps greater satiation due todifferences in digestion.The sample size for the present studywas calculated around observing differences in postprandialmetabolism.Although changes in postlunch insulin wereapparent, the sample size may have been insuf ﬁcient to detect differences in more typically noisy measures such as ad libitumenergy intake [ 72].Furthermore, given the central focus on the second-meal effect presently, both meals were analyzed sepa- rately.
However, using this approach, it is dif ﬁcult to determine if any effects seen in the lunch meal (for example, attenuatedinsulin) are additive or synergistic; this should be a focus offuture research. Although the initial sample size estimates indi-cated a required sample size of 15, only 12 participantscompleted the study ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).The 3 dropouts would have been replaced by rolling recruitment but the studywas ended at 12 due to the restrictions placed on human testingas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.In summary, consumption of a typical carbohydrate-rich breakfast or an energy matched whey protein isolate enriched breakfast attenuates the insulinemic response to a subsequentmeal, relative to if breakfast is skipped (that is, extended morningfasting).Interestingly, this effect occurred despite a lower im-mediate glycemic response to the whey protein-enriched break-fast.
However, despite the established metabolic effects noadditional effect of whey protein upon appetite was observed. Funding No funding was received for this study.Porridge oats were provided by Quaker Oats (Pepsico).
