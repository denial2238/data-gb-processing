RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in older people with Sarcopenia. Methods: Electronic searches in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, SPORTDiscus, Epistemonikos, and CINAHL databases were performed until 20 January 2023.Randomized clinical trials conducted on sarcopenic adults aged 60 or older were included.The studies had to compare the effectiveness of the addition of supplements based on concentrated, isolated, or hydrolyzed whey protein during RET and compare it with RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle mass and strength changes.The study selection process, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two independent reviewers.Results: Seven randomized clinical trials (591 participants) were included, and ﬁve of them provided data for quantitative synthesis.
The overall pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) estimate showed a small effect size in favor of RET plus WP for skeletal muscle mass according to appendicular muscle index, with statistically signiﬁcant differences compared with RET with or without the placebo group (SMD = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.42; p= 0.01 ; I2= 0% ,p= 0.42 ). The overall pooled mean difference (MD) estimate showed a signiﬁcant difference of +2.31 kg (MD = 2.31 kg; 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.6; p= 0.05; I2= 81%, p< 0.001) in handgrip strength in the RET plus WP group compared with the RET group with or without placebo.The narrative synthesis revealed discordance between the results of the studies on physical performance.Conclusions: WP supplementation during RET is more effective in increasing handgrip strength and skeletal muscle mass in older people with Sarcopenia compared with RET with or without placebo supplementation.
However, the effect sizes were small, and the MD did not exceed the minimally important clinical difference. The quality of the evidence was low to very low according, to the GRADE approach.Further research is needed in this ﬁeld.Keywords: Sarcopenia; elderly; whey protein; resistance exercise; strength training Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424.https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15153424 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 2 of 17 1.Background Sarcopenia is a condition characterized by decreased skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance [ 1].Sarcopenia has been positively correlated with elevated rates of disability, hospitalization, falls, fractures, and mortality risk in older adults [ 2,3].Compared with older adults without Sarcopenia, the deterioration of phys- ical performance is 3 times higher, and the mortality rate is 3.6 times higher in older adults with Sarcopenia [ 3].
Individuals with Sarcopenia present an increased risk of hos- pitalization for different adverse events [ 4]. For these reasons, preventing and treating Sarcopenia is essential to reducing healthcare costs [ 4].In this sense, different interventions have been recommended, including exercise training and nutritional supplementation [ 5].Progressive resistance exercise training (RET) of moderate to high intensity is one of the interventions with the highest degree of recommendation for the prevention and treatment of Sarcopenia [6–8].RET has been shown to increase skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in healthy older people or those with an increased risk of Sarcopenia [ 9–12].
Furthermore, RET has been shown to be superior in improving muscle strength of the upper and lower extremities, handgrip strength, depressive symptoms, physical perfor- mance, walking speed, and distance compared with other exercise modalities in healthy, sarcopenic, and hospitalized older people [ 9–13]. In addition, RET is an excellent, cost- effective modality for reducing frailty and the risk of falls in healthy older people [ 14,15].Similar results have been observed in older people with Sarcopenia on muscle strength and physical performance; however, the effects of RET on skeletal muscle mass are heteroge- neous [ 16–18].According to a recent meta-analysis, the effect of RET on skeletal muscle mass is still controversial since RET showed a small effect size (SMD = 0.28) on lower limb skeletal muscle mass but not overall or on upper limb skeletal muscle mass compared with education or maintaining the daily lifestyle in people with Sarcopenia [16].
Another important recommendation to treat and/or prevent Sarcopenia is protein supplementation [ 5]. As in healthy older people [ 19,20], it has been suggested that oral Whey Protein (WP) could maximize the effects of exercise and positively inﬂuence skeletal muscle anabolism in people with Sarcopenia [ 21].In older people, protein supplementation has been shown to increase overall lean mass and handgrip strength only when combined with RET [ 22].For example, WP plus leucine intake has been shown to induce postprandial increases in plasma amino acid levels and stimulate muscle protein synthesis in people with Sarcopenia to a greater extent than any other protein source [ 23].Regarding the use of WP , a daily dose of 20–40 g combined with RET has been shown to increase biceps strength and lower limb lean mass in post-menopausal women [24].
Although there is plausibility for the potential beneﬁt of the combination of WP with RET in older people with Sarcopenia, the magnitude of the effects on skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of WP supplementation during RET vs.RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older people with Sarcopenia.2.Methods 2.1.Protocol and Registration The report of this research was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and the recommendations of the Cochrane Manual of Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ 25,26].The protocol of this sys- tematic review was published in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42023391714.2.2.
Eligibility Criteria Studies that met the following inclusion criteria were eligible: (1) population: adults 60 years of age or older, diagnosed with Sarcopenia (low skeletal muscle mass, mus- cle strength, and/or physical performance, according to the criteria of the international Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 3 of 17 consensus of EWGSOP [ 1] or AWGSOP [ 27]), with or without concomitant diseases; (2) intervention: addition of supplements based on concentrated, isolated, or hydrolyzed WP during RET; RET was considered when the program training used machines, elastic bands, or free weights with moderate to high intensity (equal to or greater than 60% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), for a minimum of 6 weeks); (3) comparison: moderate and high-intensity RET with or without placebo supplementation; (4) primary outcomes: skele- tal muscle mass was measured using dual computed tomography scan, nuclear magnetic resonance, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), bioimpedance, or anthropometry; upper- and lower-limb muscle and grip strength were measured using dynamometry, 1RM, or load cell; physical performance was considered a secondary outcome: measurements con- ducted with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and walking speed were considered physical performance; and (5) types of studies: controlled clinical trials or randomized clinical trials published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese.
Studies were excluded if: (1) They were conducted in people with presarcopenia or dynapenia; (2) They were carried out with mixed samples of people with and without Sarcopenia; or (3) They were published only in conference proceedings. 2.3.Information Sources Electronic searches were performed in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Em- base, LILACS, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Epistemonikos from the beginning of each database until January 2023.In addition, manual searches were performed on the references of the articles included in the electronic searches.2.4.Search Strategies Two independent reviewers (JP-N and CO-D) performed the electronic search in the databases.
The search strategy was composed of the following MESH and free terms: “Sarcopenia”, “Sarcopenic”, “Sarcopaenia”, “Sarcopen”, “Strength training”, “Strength exercise”, “Weightlifting”, “Resistance training”, “Resistance exercise”, “Whey protein”, “Protein supplement”, “Whey supplement”, “Whey intake”, “Protein intake”, “Controlled Clinical Trial”, “Randomized controlled trial”, and “Clinical trial”. The search strategies for each database can be reviewed in Table S1 (Supplementary Materials).2.5.Study Selection The study selection process was carried out through the Rayyan collaborative web application [ 28].Duplicates were eliminated before starting the article selection process.Subsequently, two independent reviewers (JP-N and CO-D) reviewed the titles and abstracts of the studies.Studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria were discarded.Potentially eligible studies were reviewed for full text.
The agreement rate between reviewers for the study selection process was calculated using the Kappa statistic. Discrepancies between the reviewers’ assessments were discussed with a third reviewer (CV-A).2.6.Data Collection Process Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers (JP-N and I-CV).The following information was extracted: Characteristics of the population (sample size, age, health status, and level of physical activity); intervention (type of intervention, supple- ments, dosage); and results (skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, walking speed, physical performance, and dynamic balance).2.7.Risk of Bias Two independent reviewers (JP-N and WS-L) assessed studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool [ 29].
ROB 2 has six domains: bias arising from the randomization process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; bias in selection of the reported result; and overall bias. Each domain could be considered “low risk”, “some concerns”, or “high Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 4 of 17 risk” [ 29].Discrepancies between reviewers’ assessments were discussed with a third reviewer (IC-V).2.8.Statistical Methods A quantitative synthesis was performed if there were at least three studies with comparable data.There were insufﬁcient data to perform a meta-analysis of upper and lower limb strength (1RM), walking speed, SPPB, and TUG.A narrative synthesis of the effects of the interventions on physical performance was performed according to walking speed, SPPB, and TUG.A quantitative synthesis was performed for the skeletal muscle mass and handgrip strength outcomes.
Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each group. The calculation of the effect sizes considered the use of the raw baseline SD.A pooled estimate of the MD with 95% conﬁdence intervals was calculated for handgrip strength (kg).A pooled estimate of the SMD with 95% conﬁdence intervals was calculated for the appendicular muscle index and handgrip.The weighted sample size method was used to summarize effect sizes from multiple independent studies.Fixed-effects models with Mantel–Haenszel method or random-effects models with the DerSimonian-Laird method were used depending on the degree of heterogeneity.TheI2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity.For skeletal muscle mass, the effect size was considered trivial (SMD < 0.2), small (SMD 0.2–0.5), medium (SMD 0.6–0.8), or large (SMD > 0.8) [ 30].
Due to the lack of data for people with Sarcopenia, the threshold of 6.5 kg was considered a minimally important clinical difference for handgrip strength [ 31]. Subgroups were analyzed according to intervention time.Statistical signiﬁcance was considered with a pvalue < 0.05.In the case of missing data, the reviewers contacted the authors by email.Meta-analysis would be performed using RevMan Manager 5.4 (Copenhagen, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration).2.9.Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation The synthesis and quality of evidence for skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength were assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Eval- uation (GRADE) [ 32].GRADE proﬁle allows one to categorize the evidence as high, moder- ate, low, or very low quality [33].Results of the GRADE analysis are shown in Table S3.3.Results 3.1.Study Selection A total of 1047 articles were found through electronic searches.
Before starting the screening, 567 duplicate articles were eliminated, and a total of 480 articles were reviewed by title and abstract. Subsequently, 18 articles were reviewed in full text.The causes for the exclusion of articles can be seen in Table S2 (Supplementary Materials).Finally, seven randomized clinical trials were included [ 34–40].The agreement rate between reviewers reached a kappa value of 0.91.Details of the study selection process are shown in Figure 1.Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 5 of 17 Figure 1.PRISMA ﬂow diagram for the systematic review and meta-analysis.3.2.Study Characteristics Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the studies.The general population consisted of 591 people, 399 (67.5%) women, and 192 men (32.5%).The average age of the popula- tion was 77.3 years.All studies included untrained older adults.Four studies reported the inclusion of patients with comorbidities but did not report the details [ 34,36,37,40].
Three studies reported the inclusion of patients with obesity, hypertension, diabetes melli- tus, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, fractures, or a history of surgery [ 35,38,39]. Six studies were conducted in a hospital [ 34–38,40], or university outpatient setting [ 39].Five studies included outpatients [ 34,35,38–40] and two included a mixed sample of inpatients and outpatients [36,37].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 6 of 17 Table 1.Characteristics of the studies.Author and YearPopulation Characteristics Intervention Characteristics Results Total SampleGroups Sarcopenia DiagnosisTraining Level and ComorbiditiesTime Intervention and ContextGroupsSupplement RETOutcome MeasureControl Exp Control Exp Control Exp Rondanelli et al., 2016 [34]N= 130 ≥65 yearsN= 61 A = 80.2 ±8.5 M = 24 W = 37N= 69 A = 80.7 ±6.2 M = 29 W = 40DEXA < 7.26 kg/m2for M and <5.5 kg/m2 for W.NT.With comorbidities (NR).Without physical or cognitive impairment.Twelve weeks.

The WP supplementation was performed in three studies only on training days [ 36,37,39]. In four studies, WP supplementation was administered every day during or after meals [34,35,38,40].Regarding RET, four studies performed progressive RET until reaching 70% of 1RM [ 36,37,39,40].One study used conventional RET with an intensity of 80% of 1RM [ 38].Two studies used a conventional RET with moderate intensity (Borg 12–14) [ 34,35].The fre- quency of RET sessions varied from 2–5 days per week.The duration of the RET sessions ranged from 20 to 60 min.Studies used machine, free weight, body weight, or elastic band training.Five studies assessed skeletal muscle mass via DEXA [ 33–36] or multi-frecuency bioelectrical impedance analysis [ 38,40].Muscle strength was evaluated in seven studies.The studies used handgrip dynamometry [ 34–38,40], 1RM [ 39], and maximum voluntary isometric contraction [ 40].
Five studies evaluated physical performance through different tests: SPPB [ 35,36], TUG [ 35], 10-m walk test [ 39], walk speed with 4 m test [ 35], and usual walking speed [ 40]. Regarding the confounding variables, four studies [ 34,35,39,40] and one study [ 40] controlled the diet intake and the physical activity during the execution of the interventions, respectively.3.3.Risk of Bias Assessment Figures 2 and 3 show the results of the risk of bias assessment.As far as “overall bias” is concerned, 14.3% of the studies had a “low risk” and 85.7% had a “high risk”.Regarding the randomization process, 85.7% showed low risk, and 14.3% had some concerns.In the item deviations from intended interventions, 42.9% of the studies showed a low risk, 28.6% some concerns, and 28.6% a high risk.The studies showed a low risk of bias in 57.1% and a high risk of bias in 42.9% of the items missing outcome data.All studies showed a low risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome.
In relation to the selection of the reported result, 14.3% of the studies showed a low risk, 57.1% some concerns, and 28.6% a high risk.

It was observed that weekly SMD varied between -0.01 and 0.13 in favor of the RET plus WP group (Table S4, Supplementary Materials ). Four studies [ 34–36,38] with interventions lasting 4–12 showed a small effect size in favor of RET plus WP; however, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences compared with RET with or without a placebo group (SMD = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.47; p= 0.02), with no important heterogeneity ( I2= 11%, p= 0.34) (Figure 5).There was a low quality of evidence, according to the GRADE rating.Figure 4.Comparison of RET plus WP vs.RET with or without placebo for appendicular muscle index, at 4 to 24 weeks and 4 to 12 weeks [34–36,38,40].3.4.2.
Skeletal Muscle Mass: Appendicular Muscle Mass Three studies [ 34,36,38] that included data on appendicular muscle mass to perform the meta-analysis showed a small effect size in favor of RET plus WP , however, without statistically signiﬁcant differences compared with RET with or without the placebo group Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 11 of 17 at 4–12 weeks (SMD = 0.15; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.39; p= 0.21). Additionally, no important heterogeneity was observed ( I2= 0%, p= 0.63) (Figure 5).There was a low quality of evidence, according to the GRADE rating.Figure 5.Comparison of RET plus WP vs.RET with or without placebo for appendicular muscle mass at 4 to 12 weeks [34,36,38].3.4.3.Muscle Strength Five studies included data on handgrip strength to perform the meta-analysis [ 34–36,38,40].
The overall pooled MD estimate showed a difference of +2.31 kg in handgrip strength in the RET plus WP supplementation compared with the RET group with or without placebo supplementation at 4–24 weeks, with statistically signiﬁcant differences ( MD = 2.31 kg ; 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.6; p= 0.05) and considerable heterogeneity ( I2= 81%, p< 0.001 ) (Figure 6 ). There was a very low quality of evidence, according to the GRADE rating.Four stud- ies[34–36,38] with interventions lasting 4–12 weeks showed a difference of +2.71 kg in handgrip strength in the RET plus WP group compared with the RET group with or without placebo supplementation at 4–24 weeks, with statistically signiﬁcant differences (MD = 2.71 kg ; 95% CI, 0.06 to 5.36; p= 0.05 ) and considerable heterogeneity ( I2= 80% , p= 0.002 ) (Figure 6).There was a very low quality of evidence, according to the GRADE rating .Figure 6.Comparison of RET plus WP vs.
RET with or without placebo for handgrip strength at 4 to 24 weeks and 4 to 12 weeks [34–36,38,40]. 3.4.4.Physical Performance Two studies evaluated walking speed at four weeks [ 35] and 24 weeks [ 40].Mori et al.(2022) found no difference between groups [ 40].However, Rondanelli et al.(2020) showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements in walking speed in favor of the RET plus WP supplementation [ 35].Three studies evaluated physical performance according to SPPB at four [ 35] and 12 weeks [ 36,37].Amasene et al.(2021) observed no difference between groups [ 36].However, Rondanelli et al.(2020) showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements in physical performance in favor of the RET plus WP group [ 35].Only one Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 12 of 17 study evaluated dynamic balance through the TUG test at four weeks [ 35].The results indi- cated that the RET plus WP group was statistically more effective in improving dynamic balance [35].4.
Discussion The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of WP sup- plementation during RET vs. RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older people with Sarcopenia.Our results indicate that WP supplementation associated with RET is effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass according to the appendicular muscle index, and handgrip strength.However, we did not observe differences in appendicular muscle mass between RET plus WP supplementation and RET with or without placebo supplementation.In addition, the increase in handgrip strength did not exceed the minimally important clinical differ- ence [ 31].There were insufﬁcient data to perform a meta-analysis on physical performance.The results of the studies were discordant in relation to physical performance.The effectiveness of adding WP supplementation during RET has been well studied in other older populations [ 19,20,22,24].
However, systematic reviews focused on older people with Sarcopenia are scarce. In this sense, our results differ partially from the ﬁndings of the systematic review by Chang and Choo (2023), whose aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of WP , leucine, and vitamin D supplementation in patients with Sarcopenia [ 41].Based on two studies, the meta-analysis by Chang and Choo (2023) showed statistically signiﬁcant differences in favor of the WP , leucine, and vitamin D group, with moderate effect sizes for skeletal muscle mass and large effect sizes for handgrip strength.The ﬁndings of Chang and Choo (2023) are likely to have overestimated effect sizes.Even though our ﬁndings are supported by a larger number of studies, the certainty of the evidence demon- strates the need to improve the methodological quality of future studies to obtain more accurate conclusions.
The small increases in skeletal muscle mass and handgrip strength in older people with Sarcopenia could be due to several factors. There are reports demonstrating that older people performing RET (with and without Sarcopenia) present a higher percentage increase in muscle strength than in skeletal muscle mass [ 42,43].Additionally, these results could be explained by the characteristics of the sample, the dosage of the interventions, and the scant control of confounding variables, including physical activity and diet intake.Regarding the characteristics of the sample, 69.25% ( n= 265) of the participants included in our meta-analysis were women.Furthermore, 2/7 of the studies included in this systematic review were conducted only on women [ 34,37].This is relevant since it has been observed that older women with Sarcopenia tend to show a lower increase in skeletal muscle mass with RET [ 44].
On the other hand, the blunted stimulation of muscle protein synthesis rates is known as anabolic resistance, and it has been suggested as a theoretical framework to support interventions in people with Sarcopenia [ 45]. Aging anabolic resistance is inﬂuenced by factors such as digestion, absorption, anabolic signaling proteins, muscle perfusion, splanchnic amino acid sequestration, physical activity levels, and postprandial amino acid availability and delivery [ 45].Because of these factors, it has been suggested that a greater amount of WP supplementation (~40 g) [ 46] together with a RET program could be more effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass.However, the dose of WP ranged from 10 to 22 g in the studies included in the meta-analysis [34–36,38,40].We know that to build skeletal muscle mass, the amount and quality of food consumed (diet) are important.It has been reported that older people with Sarcopenia have alterations in their usual diet intake [ 47–50].
However, only three studies controlled diet intake during the intervention period [ 34,35,40]. In addition, it is well known that levels of physical activity can decrease anabolic resistance, thus increasing the effectiveness of nutritional and exercise interventions [ 45].However, only the study by Mori et al.(2022) monitored the levels of physical activity and diet intake before and after the intervention.They found that levels of physical activity and diet intake did not change after the intervention in either Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 13 of 17 group [ 40].Their results indicated that there were no differences between RET and RET plus WP supplementation in improving handgrip strength, knee extension strength, and relative skeletal muscle mass [40].RET programming, to obtain gains in skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength, must be individualized, progressive, and of moderate-high intensity (70–80% of 1RM).
However, several studies included in this systematic review performed moderate RET or adapted strength training by performing it with elastic bands or sandbags [ 35,38,40]. Additionally, training frequency could also inﬂuence the effects of RET on skeletal mus- cle mass.For example, Rondanelli et al.(2016; 2020) conducted training sessions ﬁve times a week and found statistically signiﬁcant differences in appendicular muscle mass and relative skeletal muscle mass in favor of RET plus WP supplementaion.In contrast, studies that had 2–3 weekly sessions found no differences between the groups after the intervention [ 35,36,38].Finally, current evidence shows us that evaluating skeletal muscle mass through a Computed Tomography Scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (especially changes in the thigh of older people) could be a better way to see changes [51].
Insufﬁcient and controversial scientiﬁc evidence exists on the effect of WP supple- mentation combined with RET on physical performance [ 35,36,40]. Rondanelli et al.(2020) showed that an intervention with RET plus WP supplementation induces positive effects on walking speed, physical performance using SPPB, and dynamic balance using TUG in older adults with Sarcopenia.This intervention also reduces hospitalization time, which is related to decreased healthcare expenditures and different adverse events associated with hospitalization time [ 4].However, the other two studies did not report signiﬁcant differ- ences in favor of WP supplementation plus RET compared with placebo supplementation plus RET [ 36,40].Mori et al.(2022) reported no beneﬁt in both interventions in improving walking speed [ 40], and Amasene et al.(2021) [ 36] reported that the physical performance measured using SPPB signiﬁcantly improved in both intervention groups regardless of protein-enriched supplementation.
Nonetheless, in that study [ 36], the intervention group demonstrated a decrease in the prevalence of frailty, as evidenced by ﬁve older adults supplemented with protein who were classiﬁed as frail at baseline but were no longer so after the intervention [ 36]. The results reported by Amasene et al.(2021) [ 36] emphasize the effectiveness of RET programs alone in improving the physical performance of older adults, as also reported in a recent systematic review [ 52].Therefore, the addition of WP supplementation during RET may not be necessary to achieve signiﬁcant improvements in physical performance among this population, and additional studies are required in this research ﬁeld to fully understand of the role of WP supplementation on physical performance during RET.Finally, the role of WP supplementation in the treatment of Sarcopenia has been previ- ously recommended by international consensus [ 1,27].
Prior research has suggested that physical exercise is beneﬁcial for individuals with Sarcopenia; however, it may not be sufﬁcient alone to achieve signiﬁcant clinical outcomes. As a result, a combined exercise program along with supplementation of WP , essential amino acids, and vitamin D has shown signiﬁcant effects when compared with exercise alone [ 34].That study highlights the potential beneﬁts of combined interventions to treat Sarcopenia and improve clinical outcomes.Although physical performance is an important clinical measurement to diag- nose Sarcopenia and is recommended by international consensus, it was measured only in two studies [ 34,35].Therefore, more studies to analyze the effect on all clinical measure- ments of Sarcopenia (skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance) are necessary.
Limitations Our results should be considered with caution due to the following limitations: First, despite searching eight databases, articles in other languages than English, Spanish, or Portuguese could have been excluded. Second, the studies have shown high clinical heterogeneity in terms of WP supplementation and RET dosing.Third, due to the small Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3424 14 of 17 number of articles included in the quantitative synthesis, the accuracy of the meta-analytic tests used may be affected.Fourth, although it is a consequence of the high clinical heterogeneity of the studies, the quantitative syntheses showed considerable statistical heterogeneity for handgrip strength.Fifth, it was not possible to perform a moderator analysis and assess publication biases due to the limited number of articles included in the meta-analyses.5.
Conclusions RET plus WP supplementation is more effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass and handgrip strength in older people with Sarcopenia compared with RET with or without placebo supplementation. However, the effect sizes were small for skeletal muscle mass, and the handgrip strength did not exceed the minimally important clinical difference.The quality of the evidence was low to very low, according to the GRADE approach.Further studies are needed in this research ﬁeld.Future research should report in detail the dosage and periodization of RET program, as well as the proportions of other ingredients that are incorporated into WP supplementation.Higher doses of WP supplementation and a higher frequency of intake could probably improve the results obtained to date.Changes in physical activity and diet intake are confounding variables that future studies should control for.
Strategies to avoid participant dropout, blinding, and reporting according to clinical trial registration protocols could reduce the risk of bias.
