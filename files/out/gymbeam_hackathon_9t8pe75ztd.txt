© 2024 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow 1The effect of iron supplementation on menstrual bleeding volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding : A randomized clinical trial Elnaz MokhtarKalimi, Marzeyeh Loripoor1, Mohsen Rezaeian2, MohammadReza Gholamrezapour3 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many women around the world avoid taking iron supplements during their menstrual bleeding, thinking that menstrual bleeding will increase after taking these supplements.Due to the lack of relevant scientific evidence in this regard, this study was performed to determine the effect of iron supplementation on menstrual blood volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this three‑blind randomized clinical trial, 160 non‑anemic female students of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences were selected through a public call and then they were randomly assigned to two intervention and control groups.
The intervention group was given a ferrous sulfate tablet containsing 50 mg of elemental iron daily in the first four days of bleeding for three consecutive menstrual cycles, and the control group received a placebo simultaneously. Before and after the intervention, the level of hemoglobin was measured and the Higham chart was completed in each menstrual cycle by the participants of the two groups.The obtained data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 21 and Chi‑square, independent t‑test, paired t‑test, analysis of variance with repeated measures, and nonparametric tests.RESULTS: Before performing the intervention, the mean Higham score and hemoglobin level of the two groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.307, P = 0.670).The mean Higham score after each intervention was not statistically significant between the two groups over time or when considering the interaction of the time group (P = 0.77, P = 0.916).
The hemoglobin level of these two groups did not change significantly after the intervention compared with that before the intervention (P = 0.444). CONCLUSION: Compared with a placebo, taking iron supplements containing 50 mg of elemental iron during the first four days of menstrual bleeding in non‑anemic women did not change the volume of menstrual bleeding and hemoglobin level.Keywords: Hemoglobin, iron, menstruation, students Introduction Iron deficiency anemia is a global health problem and the most common type of anemia.[1,2] More than 1.2 billion people worldwide suffer from iron deficiency anemia.
Moreover, it is one of the top five causes of disability, which ranks first among women.[3] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 43% of nonpregnant women in developing countries and 12% of them in developed countries have iron deficiency anemia.[4] One of the goals set by the WHO by 2025 is to reduce the frequency of anemia by 50%.[5] Iron deficiency anemia reduces mental concentration, learning ability, memory, resistance to diseases caused by weakened Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran, 1Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Geriatric Care Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran, 2Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Occupational Environment Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran, 3Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Ali Ibn Abitaleb Educational and Treatment Hospital, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, IranOriginal Article Access this article online Quick Response Code: Website: www.jehp.net DOI: 10.4103/jehp.jehp_1871_22 How to cite this article: MokhtarKalimi E, Loripoor M, Rezaeian M, Gholamrezapour M.

Illness perceptions and other beliefs may influence the actions of the individual and negatively or positively affect his or her health and taking medication. Healthcare providers need to understand the impact of cultural and other beliefs on patients’ adherence levels so that they can implement appropriate strategies to enhance adherence.[18,19] Many women avoid iron supplementation during menstruation and believe that iron supplementation during this period increases the amount of bleeding.We did not find any scientific evidence to confirm this belief in the review of scientific documents.Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of investigating the effect of iron supplementation on menstrual blood volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding in order to correct this common belief according to the results of the study.Since no study with a similar design was found in our search, this study is unique in its kind.
Material and Methods Study design and setting This study utilized a three‑blind randomized clinical trial design to investigate the effect of iron supplementation during menstrual bleeding on menstrual bleeding and hemoglobin level of female students of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences. The participant recruitment was conducted from December 2020 to January 2021.We followed the CONSORT guidelines.Study participants and sampling Samples according to the study by Bani et al.,[20] 95% confidence level, and 80% statistical power as well as the relevant statistical formula samples were estimated to be 73 individuals in each group.By considering the probability of attrition, this number was finally estimated at 80 individuals for each group.
The eligibility criteria of this study were as follows: not taking vitamin and iron supplements during the past 3 months; not taking oral or intravenous steroid hormonal drugs; not having liver, infectious, and parasitic diseases; not having blood diseases such as thalassemia and hemophilia; not having medical prohibition for taking iron; not being pregnant or lactating; not being smoker; BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2; hemoglobin greater than 12 grams per deciliter; normal menstrual cycle; no history of major surgery and blood transfusion; not using tampons or menstrual cups; and not having systemic diseases such as diabetes, thyroid problems, and overactive adrenal glands according to the individual herself. In case of any allergic reaction to iron tablets, forgetting to take more than one iron tablet per cycle, taking emergency contraceptive (EC) pills, being infected with coronavirus,[21] and injecting coronavirus vaccine,[22,23] they would be excluded from the study.
Data collection tool and technique Female students of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences were invited to participate in this study through a public call. By taking 2.5 cc of blood from the volunteers before performing the intervention, the hemoglobin level was determined in a single laboratory.If the hemoglobin level was more than 12 mg/dl, they could enter the study.The participants were divided into two groups of intervention and control by picking up sheets with codes A and B, which were prepared according to the number of study samples and then placed inside the opaque box.For blinding of the study, iron tablets and placebo were made exactly the same by Amin Pharmaceutical Company and were given to the researchers anonymously with A and B codes.
After analyzing the data of the study, it was determined that code A is related to placebo and MokhtarKalimi, et al.: The effect of iron supplementation on menstrual bleeding volume during menstrual bleedingJournal of Education and Health Promotion | Volume 13 | January 2024 3code B is related to iron tablets. Before conducting the intervention, the participants completed a demographic and menstrual profile questionnaire and the intervention group received 12 ferrous sulfate iron tablets, each one containing 50 mg[14] iron ions, and the control group received the same number of placebo for consumption during three menstrual cycles.The duration of the study was four menstrual cycles in total.In the first cycle, the individuals only recorded the amount of menstrual bleeding on the Higham chart[24] and confirmed its similarity to the pattern of the previous two cycles.Thereafter, they started taking iron and placebo pills from the next cycle.
Notably, the Higham chart is used to assess the amount of bleeding.[25] A score of 100 or more is equivalent to bleeding greater than 80 ml, and a score of less than 100 indicates less bleeding amount.[26] The Higham score is valid and has more than 80 sensitivities and characteristics in adult women whose scores are more than 100.[27,28] Moukhah et al.[29] have confirmed the validity and reliability of the Higham chart. In this study, the researcher explained how to complete the Higham chart to the participants.To prevent forgetfulness of consumption and better digestive tolerance, it was recommended to take iron tablets at a specific time before going to bed.Daily consumption was also reminded to them with a reminder message.The intervention group took iron tablets once a day for the first 4 days of menstrual bleeding, and the control group took a placebo in the same way and in each cycle, and all of them recorded the amount of bleeding on the Higham chart.
By passing one week of taking the last iron pill or placebo, the hemoglobin level was measured once again.[20] Ethical consideration This three‑blind randomized clinical trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences with the approval code IR.RUMS. REC.1399.077 and was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the registration code IRCT20160308026971N11.We followed all the ethical principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki for medical research involving human subjects.We obtained written informed consent from all study participants before their recruitment, which included the following information: the purpose of the research, the procedures to be followed during data collection, description of discomforts (if any) and benefits, confidentiality of the records, anonymity of the respondents, and the right of participation or withdrawal.
Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using the SPSS version 16 software. The Chi‑square test, independent t‑test, paired t‑test, Fisher’s exact test, and repeated‑measures analysis were used to compare the results at a statistically significant level of P < 0.05.Results In this study, 380 individuals were investigated to enter the research.Finally, 80 individuals were randomly assigned to each of the intervention and control groups.In addition, 18 individuals from the control group and seven individuals from the intervention group were excluded from the study, and finally, the analysis was performed with 73 people in the intervention group and 62 people in the control group [ Figure 1 ].There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics and menstrual history between the two study groups.There was no significant difference in hemoglobin levels between the two groups before the intervention ( P > 0.05) [ Table 1 ].
After performing the intervention, there was no significant difference in hemoglobin levels between the two groups based on the result of the independent t‑test (P = 0.681). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference when comparing hemoglobin levels between the groups after the end of the intervention based on the paired t‑test [ Table 2 ].There was no significant difference between the two study groups when considering the amount of menstrual bleeding by the Higham score before the intervention (P = 0.307).According to the results, there was no significant difference between these two groups after conducting each intervention.

Additionally, in the control group, the amount of menstrual bleeding during four menstrual cycles had no significant difference ( P = 0.382) [ Table 3 ].Based on the repeated‑measures analysis test and considering the effect of measurement time, there was no significant difference among the average amounts of menstrual bleeding in the first menstrual cycle (before the intervention), the second menstrual cycle (intervention), the third menstrual cycle (intervention), and the fourth menstrual cycle (intervention) (P = 0.77). By comparing the two groups, no statistically significant difference was found between the average amounts of menstrual bleeding before and after the intervention based on the repeated‑measures analysis test (P = 0.352).Also, by considering the interaction effect of time group, there was no significant difference between the average amounts of menstrual bleeding before and after performing the intervention (P = 0.916) [Table 4].
During four cycles in both the intervention and control groups, almost the same trend of Higham score was found [Chart 1].

The results showed that taking iron tablets during menstrual bleeding did not lead to increased menstrual bleeding. In the study by Bani et al.,[20] there was no difference in the amount of hemoglobin level and menstrual bleeding between two consecutive and intermittent iron administration methods.In the study by Bani et al.,[20] the aim was to compare the two methods of iron supplementation (including iron and folic acid) among anemic individuals.In this regard, the intervention group was given iron supplements at the time of menstrual bleeding.Moreover, the control group received that on a specific day of the week, and there was a possibility that this day could coincide with the days of menstrual bleeding.However, in this study, the aim was to investigate the effect of iron supplementation (including only iron) on the amount of bleeding and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding in non‑anemic people.
In addition, to increase the accuracy of the study, the control group used a placebo on the same days of bleeding and at the same time as the consumption of iron pills in the intervention group. The design of our study was one of the strong points of the study because the consumed iron supplement did not include other vitamins and mineral salts, and the control group consumed an iron placebo at the same time of menstrual bleeding.In a study by Rahimi et al.(2010)[30] with the aim of investigating the effect of vitamin E on menorrhagia, the intervention group received vitamin E and iron and the control group received placebo and iron during their menstrual days.As a result, menstrual bleeding significantly reduced in both groups, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the amount of menstrual bleeding.
Since the group of control received the vitamin E placebo, a decrease in the volume of menstrual bleeding was observed, which could be attributed to the use of iron tablets. Therefore, from the results of this study it can be concluded that the consumption of iron at the time of menstrual bleeding does not increase bleeding, which is in agreement with the result of our study, and even a decrease in bleeding was seen in the two groups.Another important factor that contributes to a negative iron balance in women at fertile age is menstruation.The normal monthly menstrual bleeding of women causes the loss of 10 to 40 mg of iron, stimulates the iron Table 4: Intergroup comparison of changes in average bleeding amounts in the two groups during four menstrual cycles Repeated measurement PSum of squares Df Average of squares F 0.77 5062.76 3 1687.58 2.303 Effect of measurement time 0.916 376.91 3 125.63 0.171 Interaction effect of time group 0.352 7430.42 1 7430.

(2017),[32] a significant difference was found in the iron status indicators including Hb, serum iron, TIBC, and MCV on different phases of the menstrual cycle with the highest values during the luteal phase and the lowest one during the menstrual phase. In the study by Frass (2015),[33] a significant association was found between the decreased hemoglobin level and postpartum hemorrhage.The increase in bleeding was expressed due to the role of heme in the structure of hemoglobin as well as the failure of oxygen transportation by hemoglobin to the uterus and cell function and tissue enzyme dysfunction, and as a result, a blood vessel constriction disorder was expressed.[33,34] The results of the study by Angeli et al.(2016)[16] also showed that blood loss during menses would result in more iron loss, which would consequently lead to lower hepcidin concentrations, so the release of stored iron in the body and the absorption of iron from the diet would increase.
The results of the abovementioned studies can prove the appropriateness of taking iron pills during menstrual bleeding, and based on the results of this study, the public’s concern about increased menstrual bleeding due to taking iron pills at this time is a false belief. There was no significant difference between the hemoglobin levels of the two intervention and control groups before and after the treatment, which could be due to the short period and low dose of iron consumed.Moreover, in the study by Bani et al.[20] and Rahimi et al.,[30] the hemoglobin levels of the two groups were not significantly different.Due to the limited number of available studies on the use of iron supplements during menstruation, we will discuss the results of some studies on the effect of other supplements, minerals, and vitamins on menstrual bleeding.In the study by Cueto et al.
(2015),[35] there was no clear association among the consumption of folic acid supplements or multivitamins containing folic acid and iron, cycle regularity, and duration and intensity of menstrual bleeding compared with the control group. Since there was iron in multivitamins containing folic acid and its consumption did not increase menstrual bleeding, the result of this study is in agreement with the result of our study.The results of studies showed that some food sources rich in iron were effective in reducing menstrual bleeding according to the PBAC scores.[36,37] Therefore, from the results of these studies it can be concluded that the consumption of food sources rich in iron at the time of menstrual bleeding does not increase bleeding, which is in agreement with the result of our study, and even a decrease in bleeding was observed.
However, because iron tablets were used in the present study and food sources rich in iron were used in these studies, the results of these studies may not be generalizable to the results of the present study. The results of the study by Gagnon et al.(2017)[38] showed that negative beliefs about medicines are as prevalent in the community as external barriers to accessing medicines, but negative beliefs were more significantly associated with adherence than external barriers.Physicians should identify and address patients’ negative beliefs about medicines to improve adherence rates.Since negative beliefs about medicines can influence adherence rates, the result of this study shows the importance of conducting this study and correcting the beliefs of society about compliance and consumption of iron supplement.
According to the results of the study by d’Arcangues et al.,[39] vitamin E and low‑dose aspirin, alone or in combination, have no effect on the treatment of Norplant‑induced prolonged bleeding or the vaginal bleeding patterns of these women. Łagowska (2018)[40] has shown that women with low vitamin D levels were almost five times more likely to have menstrual cycle disorders.Bahman et al.’s[41] study showed that vitamin D and calcium supplementations in women with PCOS can lead to better results in all PCOS symptoms, including regular menstruation and ovulation.It seems that the use of supplements during menstrual bleeding does not affect the amount of bleeding, but the lack of some of them, such as vitamin D and iron, can cause menstrual cycle disorders, including increased menstrual bleeding amount.Limitations and recommendation Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the closure of universities in Iran, and the unavailability of a large number of students, sampling was prolonged.
Conclusion According to the results of this study, taking iron tablets containing 50 mg of iron ions in the first four days of menstrual bleeding in non‑anemic women had no effect on menstrual bleeding and hemoglobin level compared with a placebo. Therefore, because iron absorption increases during menstrual bleeding[16] and the prevention of iron deficiency anemia is important, it is necessary to consider these points and correct their beliefs, if necessary, at the time of prescribing iron supplements to women.These findings emphasize the need to conduct more studies in this field.Abbreviations BMI: body mass index; EC: emergency contraception.Acknowledgements This study is the result of a thesis on an MS degree that is registered on December 20, 2020, in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the registry code IRCT20160308026971N11.
