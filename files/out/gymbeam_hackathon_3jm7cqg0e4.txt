Data were collected using interviews of traditional healers selected randomly. The main reporteddiseases for which E.senegalensis was used by the traditional he alers were amenorrhea, malaria, jaundice, infections, abortion, wound, and body pain (chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain etc).The fidelity level (which esti mates the agreement of traditional healers on the same area about a reported use of the plant) was calculated to co mpare the results from the three areas.Certain differences were noticed, the mo st striking was the fact that am enorrhea was the most reported d i s e a s e i n D i o i l a a n d K o l o k a n i w i t h 2 1 % o f a g reement for both areas, while this use was not reported in Koutiala at all.Similarities existe d between the three areas on the use of the plant against malaria and infections, although with diff erent degree of agreement among the healers.
We also report the results of a literature survey on compounds isolated from the plant and their biological activities. A comparison of these results with th e ethnopharmacological information from Mali and other countries showed that some of the traditional indications in Mali are scientifically supported by the literature.For instance, the use of E.senegalensis against infectious diseases (bilharzias, schistosomiasis, pneumonia etc.) is sustained by several anti bacterial and antifungal compounds isolated from different parts of the plant.The comparison also showed thatpharmacologists have not fully inve stigated all the possib le bioactivities that healers ascribe to this plant.Background Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae), locally known as "Nté", is a plant that is used in traditional medicine tocure several diseases.
In 2005, a survey was performed inthree different regions in Mali (West Africa) to collectinformation on the uses of seven plants species used in traditional medicine; E. senegalensis was included in that study [1].Little ethnopharmacological information wascollected about this plant then since the traditional useswere investigated only in one of the regions where the sur-Published: 5 March 2008 Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2008, 4:6 doi:10.1186/1746-4269-4-6Received: 21 December 2007 Accepted: 5 March 2008 This article is available from: http ://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/6 © 2008 Togola et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0 ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the orig inal work is properly cited.
Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2008, 4:6 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/6 Page 2 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)veys were performed. As part of the continuing research and development of Improved Traditional Medicine (ITM), ethnopharmacological surveys are being per-formed by the Department of Traditional Medicine ofMali (the official institute in charge of Malian traditionalmedicine).Information is collected on the traditionaluses of plants that are chosen as source of possible phy- toremedies.The aim of this study is to provide thorough information on the use of E.senegalsensis in the traditional practice of three regions of Mali and make a link between this knowl-edge and information available in the scientific literature on bioactive compounds present in the plant.
Based on these results, discussion will be raised whether the healingpotential of this tree should be limited to the traditionalpractice in Mali, or the local knowledge suggests otherpharmacological potentials to be investigated in modernbioscience. This may generate new research hypothesis forfuture studies of this plant.The results of the survey will also add knowledge about the use of E.senegalensis from areas in Mali that have not been investigated previously,and will thus be an important background for the possibledevelopment of an ITM from the plant.Methods The survey on the ethnopharmacological uses of Erythrina senegalsensis was carried out according to the method described in [1].The healers to be interviewed wereselected randomly and no appointment was made prior tothe visits.Healers that consented were asked to give theirknowledge about the diseases against which they use E.senegalensis .
Questions were asked about the method of preparation of the remedies, details of administration,including the approximate amounts and number of dosesper day or week. The healers were also asked if the remedyhad any adverse effect.The interview team was composedof pharmacists, pharmacy students, botanists, and a med- ical doctor or nurse.The conversations were performed in the national language "bambara" which was fluently spo-ken by both traditional healers and interviewers, and theinformation was directly translated and written in Eng-lish.The conversations were built on trust with the com-mon goal to improve the health situation in the countryand to preserve and increase the knowledge on medicinal plants through published data issued from the survey results.This study follows ethical aspects set by the ethicalcommittee of the Malian government.
Traditional healersare considered as part of the Malian health care systemand a collaboration has been developed by the Depart-ment of Traditional Medicine with associations of tradi- tional healers; details of this collaboration and information on the organization of Malian traditionalmedicine are given in a previous publication [2].The fidelity level (Fl) among the healers from the same district was calculated according to the following formula: Fl (%) = (Np/N) × 100Np is the number of healers from one given district that claim a use of a plant species to treat a particular disease, and N is the number of healers from the same district that use the plants as a medicine to treat any given disease. Theformula was applied in order to compare data from differ-ent districts where the survey was performed [3] The literature review was performed within the databases available via the library of the University of Oslo (Nor- way) (Scifinder, BIBYS, Biological abstract/WebSPIRS andOVID web).
The search words were Erythrina senegalensis coupled with biological activity. Results Ethnopharmacological information The traditional medical uses of E.senegalensis in Dioila, Kolokani and Koutiala are presented in Table 1, 2 and 3respectively.Apart from the commonly known name Nté,traditional healers reported other local names of the plantthat were different between the regions.In Kolokani theplant was only called Nté, but in Dioila a variety of local names was reported.These were N'tièmè, Surodolé, and Mousonidé.In Koutiala the plant was called N'gumè,Donitulu and Zoroblé.Several diseases and symptomswere reported by traditional healers against which E.sen- egalensis was used.The main reported ones were malaria, jaundice, infections, gastrointestinal disorders (gastric ulcer, diarrhoea, constipation) amenorrhoea, dysmenor- rhoea, sterility, onchocerchosis, body pain (chest pain,back pain, abdominal pain headache and body weak-ness).
The plant was also reported to have wound healingand contraceptive properties (Table 1, 2 and 3). The Fidelity Level (FL) which estimates the agreement between the traditional healers about a reported use wascalculated for the most reported diseases.The results areshown in table 4; the reported uses which did not meetmore than 5% of agreement were not included in thetable.The FL for the reported diseases was not high in gen-eral (21% for the highest FL in this study).This shows a low degree of agreement between the traditional healers on the uses of E.senegalensis.The most reported disease against which E.senegalensis was used both in Dioila and Kolokani was amenorrhoea.The FL for this use was 21% (the highest FL) for both regions.Interestingly, no report of the plant to cure amen- orrhoea was mentioned in Koutiala.This shows a differ-ence between this region and the other two.
The useagainst malaria was reported for all the survey areas with Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2008, 4:6 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/6 Page 3 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Table 1: Traditional uses of Erythrina senegalensis in Dioila Indications (Number of citationPlants parts used Mode of preparation A dded substances Mode of Administration Amenorrhoea (22 citation) Root powder Cola nitida nut (alternatively) fumigati on of sexual organs, maceration consume in porridge or coffeedecoction honey, Pennisetum sp oral meat soup or cereal consume Flower decoction Cola nitida nut oral, body bath powder consume in porridge Bark powder Cola nitida nut oral infusion oral Malaria, Neuralgic malaria (12 citations)Root powder consume in porridge or water maceration roots of Entada Africana and Cochlospermum planchoni , lemonoral decoction oral, body bath Stem bark powder Fumigation, infusion, body bath decoction oralmaceration oral Leaves and Root decoction oral Jaundice (10 citatio n) Root decoction oral maceration oralpowder water oral infusion oral Bark decoction oral maceration Pennisetum sp oral Leaves and bark decoction oral, body bath Tonic (9 citations) Root decoction oral Bark decoction Pennisetum sp oral, consume with porridge leaves decoction body bath Gastrointestinal disorders (8 citations)Root decoction Pennisetum sp , honey consume maceration milk oral Leaves decoction oral powder porridge consume Bark powder porridge consume maceration oral Dysmenorrhoea (5 citations) Root maceration Pennisetum sp oral powder water oral, fumigationdecoction oral Bark decoction body bathFlower powder consume Oedema (5 citations) Root decoction root of Entada africana , honey oral, external application on the oedema site powder watermacerate Pennisetum sp oral Infections (4 citations) Root decoction Pennisetum sp oral, external application maceration Pennisetum sp oral Bark decoction oral maceration Pennisetum sp oral Fever (4 citations) Root powder water oral Leaves/root/bark decoction oral Anuria (2 citations ) Root maceration oral Bark maceration oral Inflammation (2 citations) Bark powder Butyrospermun parkii nut butter exter nal application carbonise banana peal, bu tter external application Contraceptive (2 citations) Seeds oralSomnolence Root decoction oral Prostate Root decoction spicy ri ce or millet food consume Onchocercosis Bark dec oction leaves of Leptadenia hastata oral, body bath Backache Bark powder Butyrospermun parkii nut butter back massage with ointment Abortion Root powder fruit of Aframomun melegueta , salt oral Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2008, 4:6 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/6 Page 4 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)the second highest FL in Dioila and Kolokani (12 and 16% respectively), and the highest agreement in Koutiala (17%).
The use of the plant to cure infections reached 12.5% of agreement in Koutiala (third highest FL in thisarea) and 5% in Dioila (data not included in table 4),while this use was only reported once in Kolokani (table2). Plant parts used and mode of preparation of the remedies The most reported plant parts used differed between theregions (table 5).In Dioila, more than 50% of the reme-dies were prepared using the roots, while in Kolokani andKoutiala, the use of the stem bark was predominant (43and 48% respectively).The leaves, the flowers and theseeds were less used than the root and stem bark in all regions and the two latest were not used at all in Koutiala.The use of the plant material can also depend on its avail-ability.E.senegalensis is an evergreen tree, and leaves are always available, but the flowers and seeds have shorttime of availability.The healers agreed to some extent onthe diseases against which this plant was used, but doses varied from healer to healer.
The amount of plant part used was "traditionally estimated". The quantity of leaves,trunk bark and root was estimated as handful (250 Gapprox.).When the plant material was transformed in topowder, the amount to be used was measured as tea spoon, soup spoon, or in fingers (pinch with 2 to 5 fingers gives 10 to 15 mG approx.according to number of finger used).The traditional healers from the investigated areas agreed on the non toxicity of E.senegalensis remedies.As side effects, diarrhoea and vomiting were reported only onceeach in Dioila, the first was related to the use of the root powder against malaria, and the second to the use of the same plant part against gastrointestinal disorder.A healerfrom Kolokani reported that the oral absorption of thestem bark powder for curing chest pain was not to be usedduring pregnancy.All the survey areas showed a great similarity on the mode of preparation of the remedies.
Decoction was the mostreported one (table 5), followed by maceration of theplant parts in plain water or water used for washing thepounded seeds of Pennisetum sp . Large quantities of liq- uids were utilized to prepare the decoctions, especially when the remedy was supposed to be used as a body bath.Most of the remedies were orally administrated and at thesame time used to wash the entire body.The amount ofremedy to be drunk was also traditionally estimated.ItChild night diseases (fever, insomnia)Root maceration oral, body bath Snake-bite Root decoctio n external application Dizziness Leaves decoction steam bath, body bathSecondary sterility Leaves decoction oralNose bleeding Root carbonise nose applicationPneumonia Root decoction s team bat, body bath Anxiety Bark powder fumigation Child internal wound Bar k powder porridge consume Metroragi Leaves/bark decoction oral, body bathTable 1: Traditional uses of Erythrina senegalensis in Dioila (Continued) Table 2: Traditional uses of E.

70 mL) to tea cup (approx. 250 mL) for adults and handful of liquid for children.Most of the macerations were left overnight, but in a fewcases the maceration took place for 7 days.The time for preparation of decoctions were not precisely given, patients were supposed to proceed the cooking until halfof the liquid had evaporated or until the decoctionreached a dark colour.In each of the survey area, morethan 10% of the remedies were directly mixed with othertypes of food, e.g.powder preparations were mixed with tea or water (table 5).Other substances (honey, salt, lemon, etc.) were added to the remedies as well (table 1,2, 3).The healers reported that the taste of the food wouldmask the taste of the remedies making them easer to beconsumed by the patient.
In a few cases, plant parts wereused directly without any cooking process; they were eaten directly or locally applied on the skin or wounds as a powder (table 1).Literature survey of previous studies on compounds with biological activities isolated from E. senegalensis From the literature survey, E.senegalensis was found to have been substantially studied and several compounds have been isolated from this plant.Few studies on the bio- logical activities of the compounds isolated directly fromthe specie E.senegalensis were performed, but in the liter- ature it was found that biological activities were tested onthe same compounds isolated from other plants or otherErythrina species as shown below.The biological activities of the isolated compounds might draw a link between the modern science and the traditional use of the plant.- Antimicrobial, antiviral and antiparasitic compounds Taylor et al.isolated 2,3 dihydroauriculatin from E.sen- egalensis [4].
The same compound was also isolated from the acetone extract of the root bark of Ormosia monosperma Urb. (Fabaceae) that showed moderate activities againstoral microbial organisms ( Streptococcus mutans , Prophy-Table 3: Traditional uses of E.

Erybraedin A is a flavonoid isolated from many Erythrina species, like, E.latissima E.Mey.(Fabaceae), E.zeyheri Harv.(Fabaceae) and E.senegalensis .The compound is known as an antimicrobial agent and has been shown to have a strong activity against yeast spores [6].Erybraedinalso showed a high growth inhibitory potency againstvancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) and multiresist-ant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).These antibacterial activities were based on bacteriostatic action.
The authors also showed that the combination of erybraedin and van- comycin acts either synergistically or additively againstVRE and MRSA [7]. The isoflavonoid 6–8-diprenylgenistein isolated from the stem bark of E.senegalensis [8] inhibited in vitro 36 differ- ent strains of Staphylococcus aureus at less than 200 µg/mL, 29 strains of Shigella spp and 27 strains of Salmonellae spp both between 25 and 200 µg/mL.Pseudomonas spp and Klebsiella spp were also fairly sensitive toward the com- pound.All the bacteria strains were clinically isolatedfrom human [9].Senegalensein, (also named Lonchocarpol A) isolated from the stem bark of E.senegalensis [10] exhibited a HIV- inhibitory activity with an IC 50 of 2.7 µg/mL [11] and an antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus , methi- cillin resistant, and Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistant, with a minimal inhibition concentration value ranging between 0.78–1.56 µg/mL for both bacteria [12].
Alpumisoflavone was isolated from the methanol extract of the stem bark of E. senegalensis [8], and also isolated from the chloroform extract of the seeds of Millettia thonningii Barker (Leguminosae) and found to prevent the establishment of schistosomiasis infection when applied to mouse skin 2 to 24 hours before exposure to Schisto- soma mansoni .The mechanism was not understood, but the authors thought that cercariae may be inhibited by thesolubilised compounds in the water in which they are swimming [13].A fraction containing a mixture of alpinu-misoflavone and dimethylalpinumisoflavone in a ratio of23:14 also isolated from the dichloromethane extract ofthe seeds of Millettia thonningii , showed bioactivities against Schistosoma mansoni miracidia, cercariae and adult worms.The compounds immobilized miracidia and cer- cariae, inhibited the egg production and killed all S.man- soni adult worms at a concentration of 50 µg/mL after 24 hr of exposure.
No miracidia movement was observedafter an exposure of only 50 min to the compounds [14]. The presence of these antimicrobial, antiviral and antipar- asitic compounds in different parts of E.senegalensis might explain and validate its uses in traditional medicineagainst urinary bilharziosis, gonorrhoea, and variousother type of infections in Mali and other areas [1,15].- Cytotoxic compounds Alpinumisoflavone isolated from Erythrina indica Lam.(Fabaceae) was found to be strongly cytotoxic againsthuman solid tumour cells (KB cells).Erysenegalensein Ealso show a certain degree of toxicity [16].Wandji et al.have isolated Erysenegalensein E from the methanol extract of the stem bark of E.senegalensis [17].Erythrisenegalone and Senegalensein, two prenylated-fla- vanones, both isolated from the stem bark of E.senegalen- sis [10,18] have shown anti-tumour promoting activity in vitro in the Epstein-Barr virus early antigens (EBV-EA)inhibition test.
The EBV is known to be activated by tumour promotors, including 12- O-tetradecanoylphor- bol-13-acetate (TPA). Evaluation of EBV-EA inhibition isnow used as primary in vitro screening for anti-tumourpromoting activity.At the concentration of 1 × 10 3 mol, erythrisenegalone and senegalensein were found to show100% inhibitory activity [19].Alpinumisoflavone and derrone (the latest also isolated from the stem bark methanol extract of E.senegalensis )Table 5: Comparison of the plant parts used and the mode of preparation of the remedies between Dioila, Kolokani and Koutiala.Remedies Regions Plant parts used* (% of each ) Mode of preparation** (% of each) RS BLF S D M M F M W Dioila 53 29 10 6 2 53 21 17 9 Kolokani 22 43 22 9 4 71 12 12 5Koutiala 30 48 22 - - 48 38 14 - * R: Roots; SB: Stem Bark; L: Leaves; F: Flower, S: Seeds.

Cancer diseases are not well known by traditional healers as their practice is symptom directed.Although the samesymptoms can be encountered for several diseases, noreport of such type of illness was mentioned during the ethnopharmacological surveys in Mali.- Compounds with other activities Alpinumisoflavone, also isolated from the fruit of Cudra- nia tricuspidata [Bureau ex Lavallée (Moraceae)], signifi- cantly inhibited the total mouse brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in a concentration-dependant manner [21].MAO inhibitors may be a useful therapeuticapproach for the treatment of depressive and anxiety dis-orders, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases [22].
In ourfield work a traditional healer in Dioila reported the useof the stem bark of E. senegalensis to cure anxiety (table 1); although this was reported only once, it might have a link to this tested biological activity.Erysodine, an alkaloid isolated from the methanol extract of the seeds of E.senegalensis [23] was found to be a potent inhibitor of [ 3H]cytosine binding at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and a less potent inhibitor of [125]α-bungarotoxin binding at muscle-type nicotinic ace- tylcholine receptors.The potent and competitive naturetogether with its ability to enter the brain after systemicadministration suggest that erysodine may be a useful toolin characterising neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine recep-tors [24].Erytrinasinate, an ester isolated from the hexane stem bark extract of E.senegalensis [25], showed a weak perox- ynitrite scavenging activity [26].Discussion This research contributes to a better understanding of theuses of E.
senegalensis in traditional practice of Mali. Tradi- tional healers from Dioila, Kolokani and Koutialareported a variety of local name for E.senegalensis .When a plant is known under several local names that are differ-ent from one region to another, a sample of plant materielmay be needed during field research to avoid confusion with other plant species.Fortunately in our case, the local name Nté was recognized by the healers all over the differ-ent regions.The healers also reported a variety of ailments against which E.senegalensis is used.In some cases, the reported diseases are in fact symptoms only, which indicate that the traditional practice in these areas is symptom directed.This is the case of the traditional practice in variousregions of Mali since there are few other means of diagno- sis apart from the symptoms reported by the patients [27].
The results of this study show little difference between the regions investigated in the type of the reported diseasesapart from the interesting fact the healers from the Kou-tiala region did not mention amenorrhoea as an impor- tant ailment against which E. senegalensis was used.This was the most frequent condition mentioned in the othertwo regions.Jaundice was not mentioned as such inKolokani.As reported in the method section, the healers to be inter- viewed were chosen randomly.Dioila was the region where more healers were interviewed; consequently, moreailments were reported in this region.The potential of aplant to cure a disease can be estimated by its FL [3].Theagreement on the different ailments treated among heal-ers from the same region was low in this study comparedto what was observed in our previous study [1] where an agreement up to 54% related to the use of e.g.Opilia celt- idifolia (Guill.& Perr.) Endl.
ex Walp (Opiliaceae) against abdominal pain and 61% against malaria was noticed inthe Dioila region. The lower FL observed in the presentstudy can not be attributed to the number of healer inter-viewed because this number was approximately the same in both studies performed in the same region.Results of literature research on the traditional uses of E.senegalensis in other countries showed some similarities with our studies.E.senegalensis was the plant most fre- quently reported to be used to treat infectious diseases in Guinea [15].In Siby (Mali) amenorrhoea was the most reported disease against which the plant was used; it isalso known to cure urinary bilharzia and eye infec-tions[1].Doses and treatment durations were not pre-cisely given by traditional healer in Mali.Longuefosse etal.[28] also reported the lack of exact doses in the tradi- tional practice in Martinique.The reason for this may be that the healers did not want the reveal all their knowl-edge.
The results of the literature research where both chemical compounds and their biological activities were in focus,showed that E senegalensis has a great healing potential, especially related to infectious diseases, but also other types of ailments related to the immune system. Theseresults substantiate the use of E.senegalensis in traditional medicine in Mali.However, the healing potential as reported by traditional healers has not been fully investigated by pharmacologi- cal studies.Traditional healers strongly supported the useof E.senegalensis against amenorrhoea which was the most reported indication in four of the five regions investigated Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2008, 4:6 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/6 Page 8 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)in this and a previous studies [1], no pharmacological evi- dence was found to support this and several others utiliza- tions which indicates that E.
senegalensis is a good candidate for biological research. As the flower of E.sen- egalensis is bright red, one might also assume that this use was associated with the so-called signature doctrine,which is a frequent theory of why certain plants are used against a specific ailment.Although some of these reported indications are not well defined or are onlysymptoms that are encountered in several diseases, otherare well defined illnesses (like malaria) that need a phar-macological investigation to substantiate the traditionaluse.Several of the symptoms or ailments reported could also be covered by a single pharmacological activity.For example, an anti-schistosomal or antifungal activitymight be related to traditional indications such as diar-rhoea, abdominal pain, and even fever that can be relatedto bacterial infection.
Most of the biological activitiesreported in the literature are in vitro studies, thus further investigations ( in vivo study) are needed to correlate the ethnopharmacological uses to the biological activity of a particular compound. Most of the compounds studied have been isolated from organic extracts of the plant material while traditionalhealers use water extract to cure their patients.The ques- tion how these non-water-soluble compounds could be the active principle in phytoremedies normally given aswater extracts is interesting.One probable explanationmight be the low minimal inhibit concentrations ( µg range) of these compounds to give effect.Another couldbe that co-extraction can take place as plant material often contain compounds like saponins that will enhance the solubility of an otherwise non-soluble compound ifpresent in the same mixture.Conclusion The ethnopharmacological survey showed the healing potential of E.
senegalensis based on traditional knowledge in the regions of Dioila, Kolokani and Koutiala in Mali.Certain differences about the uses exist between the 3areas which were estimated by the fidelity level among thetraditional healers in the regions. The results of the litera-ture research showed that the antimicrobial activity of thisplant has largely been investigated and can explain parts of the traditional uses of E.senegalensis .However, when compared with the local knowledge, the literature data arefar from giving confirmation of all the activities claimedfor this plant.Several traditional uses are still to beexplored both in vitro and in vivo bioassays.E.
senegalensis is now in our laboratory undergoing further investigations for identification of other chemical compounds having biological activities that may be of importance in the viewof its use for production into an Improved TraditionalMedicine in Mali.Competing interests The author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-ests.
