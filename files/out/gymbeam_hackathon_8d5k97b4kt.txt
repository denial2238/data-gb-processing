However, studies on this topic to date have several important limitations. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current state of the art of all randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of Mg supplementation versus placebo on serum parameters of inﬂammation.We searched several databases until 23 November 2021 for RCTs.Eligible studies were RCTs investigating the effect of oral Mg supplementation vs.placebo and having serum inﬂammatory markers as an outcome.Among 2484 papers initially screened, 17 randomized controlled trials (889 participants; mean age: 46 years; females: 62.5%) were included.Generally, a low risk of bias was present.In meta-analysis, Mg supplementation signiﬁcantly decreased serum C reactive protein (CRP) and increased nitric oxide (NO) levels.
In descriptive ﬁndings, Mg supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced plasma ﬁbrinogen, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 , tumor necrosis factor-ligand superfamily member 13B, ST2 protein, and IL-1. In conclusion, Mg supplementation may signiﬁcantly reduce different human inﬂammatory markers, in particular serum CRP and NO levels.Keywords: magnesium; inﬂammation; C reactive protein; tumor necrosis factor; randomized controlled trial; meta-analysis 1.Introduction The literature regarding the health beneﬁts of magnesium (Mg) is exponentially in- creasing [ 1].In an umbrella review with 16 meta-analyses and 50 independent outcomes ﬁndings suggested that Mg is associated with several positive health outcomes [ 1].
It is widely known that Mg is involved in more than 600 enzymatic reactions [ 2], consequently having a wide spectrum of actions in pregnancy [ 3–5], as well as in cardiovascular [ 6,7], gastrointestinal [8], infectious [9], and metabolic diseases [10], such as diabetes [11,12]. It should be acknowledged that several papers have reported that Mg has positive effects on medical events likely owing to improving inﬂammatory parameters [ 13–15].For example, one observational study reported an inverse relationship between dietary magnesium intake and inﬂammatory parameter levels (in particular C-reactive protein, CRP) in people affected by obesity [ 13].However, observational studies on this topic to date have been limited by research design or heterogeneity of the participants included (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) and likely underpowered to achieve comprehensive and reliable conclusions [ 14,15].
Two meta-analyses have also shown that Mg supplementation can have differing effects on some indices of inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory indexes, Nutrients 2022 ,14, 679. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14030679 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2022 ,14, 679 2 of 10 such as CRP [ 14,15].Despite the importance of these two meta-analyses [ 14,15], many other studies are now available although the evidence is limited to CRP as an outcome.Although the pathophysiological mechanisms through which Mg may improve in- ﬂammatory status is not clear yet, it has been demonstrated in, animal models and human studies that Mg deﬁciency acts as a trigger for the inﬂammatory process [ 15].A possible explanation is that the reduction of Mg levels stimulates macrophages and inﬂux of calcium ions into cells [ 16].
The increased cell calcium levels increase the Mg necessary to block the inﬂux of calcium ions with an increased stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors that present high permeability to calcium [ 16]. Thus, the stimulation of these receptors lead to the opening of non-selective channels to cations with a consequent rise of calcium ions in neuronal cells [ 16].The result is the releasing of neurotransmitters and cytokines as IL-6 that, in turn, enhance CRP release starting the inﬂammatory response [17].Given this background, the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to sum- marize the current state of the art of all randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating the ef- fects of Mg supplementation versus placebo on serum parameters of chronic inﬂammation .2.Materials and Methods This systematic review adhered to the PRISMA statement [ 18] and followed a pre- planned, but unpublished protocol enclosed in the Supplementary Material.2.1.
Data Sources and Searches Two investigators (NV and DP) independently conducted a literature search using several databases including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science from database inception until 23 November 2021, including RCTs investigating the effect of oral Mg vs. placebo on serum inﬂammatory parameters (outcome).In PubMed, the following search strategy was used: (‘magnesium’) AND (‘inﬂam- mation’ OR ‘inﬂammatory’ OR ‘interferons’ OR ‘interferon’ OR ‘TNF’ OR ‘tumor necrosis factor’ OR ‘IL’ OR ‘interleukin’ OR ‘TGF’ OR ‘transforming growth factor’ OR ‘CRP’ OR ‘C-reactive protein’ OR ‘cytokines’ OR ‘cytokine’) AND (‘clinical trial’ OR ‘randomized controlled trial’ OR ‘placebo’), adapting the search according to the database.Any inconsis- tencies were resolved by consensus with a third author (LS).2.2.
Study Selection Inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were: (i) RCT; (ii) double-blind design; (iii) use of oral Mg supplementation; (iv) assessment of serum inﬂammatory parameters at follow- up evaluation; (v) written in English. Studies were excluded if: (i) did not include humans; (ii) used a control group taking other substances than placebo; (iii) lack of sufﬁcient infor- mation regarding serum inﬂammatory parameters.2.3.Data Extraction Two independent investigators (NV and DP) extracted key data from the included articles in a standardized Excel spread sheet and a third independent investigator (LS) checked the data.For each article, we extracted data on author names, year of publication, country, condition, study design (crossover or parallel), Mg daily dosage, and follow-up duration (in weeks).Moreover, we extracted data by Mg or placebo in relation to mean age, body mass index (BMI), and number of females at baseline.2.4.
Outcomes The primary outcomes were the values of serum parameters of inﬂammatory markers after treatment with Mg compared to placebo. 2.5.Quality Assessment Two authors (NV and DP) completed scoring using the risk of bias (RoB) tool suggested by the Cochrane group [ 19].This tool assesses several domains of the quality of each RCT, Nutrients 2022 ,14, 679 3 of 10 including: adequacy of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, incomplete data outcome (assessment of dropouts), selective outcome reporting, and the presence of other sources of bias.The potential answers were, as the Cochrane Handbook suggests, low risk of bias, high or unclear [20].2.6.Data Synthesis and Analysis All analyses were performed using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).Outcomes with at least three studies were meta-analyzed, whilst outcomes with less than three studies were reported descriptively.
The primary analysis compared serum parameters of inﬂammatory markers between participants treated with oral Mg supplementation vs. placebo at the follow-up evaluation.We calculated the difference between the means of the treatment and placebo groups using follow-up data through standardized mean differences (SMD) with their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs), applying a random-effect model [ 21].Heterogeneity across studies was assessed by the I2metric and χ2statistics.Given signiﬁcant heterogeneity (I2≥50%, p< 0.05 ) and for outcomes having at least ten studies, we conducted a series of meta- regression analyses, according to follow-up (weeks), daily Mg dose, and differences at the baseline evaluation between treated with Mg and placebo in mean BMI, age, CRP serum levels, and percentage of females.Publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots and using the Begg– Mazumdar Kendall tau [22] and the Egger bias test [23].
For all analyses, a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. 3.Results 3.1.Search Results As shown in Figure 1, among 2501 records initially screened, 31 were retrieved as full-texts: of them, 17 papers [ 17,24–39] were included in the systematic review with 15 contributing to the meta-analysis.Nutrients 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 12 Figure 1.PRISMA flow-chart.3.2.Study and patient characteristics Full details regarding descriptive findings are reported in Table 1.Among the 17 RCTs included, six were conducted in Asia, eight in North or South America, and three in Europe.The conditions ranged from metabolic disorders (includ-ing diabetes, pre-diabetes, overweight/o besity) present in 12 RCTs, pregnancy ( n = 1), cardiovascular ( n = 1), and respiratory conditions ( n = 2).The median follow-up was 12 weeks, with a range between 4 and 26.The majority of the studies ( n = 7) used a quantity of 250 mg/daily of Mg oxide ( n = 5).
Altogether, 447 participants were randomized to Mg treatment: these participants had a mean age of 47.1 ± 9.3 years, were mainly female (=62.5%) with a mean BMI of 29.0 kg/m 2. Conversely, 442 participants were rand omized to the placebo group, having a similar mean age (46.8 ± 8.7 years), % of females (59.6%), and mean BMI (29.2 kg/m2) to the intervention group (Table 1).

The conditions ranged from metabolic disorders (including diabetes, pre-diabetes, overweight/obesity) present in 12 RCTs, pregnancy ( n= 1), cardio- vascular ( n= 1), and respiratory conditions ( n= 2). The median follow-up was 12 weeks, with a range between 4 and 26.The majority of the studies ( n= 7) used a quantity of 250 mg/daily of Mg oxide ( n= 5).Altogether, 447 participants were randomized to Mg treatment: these participants had a mean age of 47.1 ±9.3 years, were mainly female (=62.5%) with a mean BMI of 29.0 kg/m2.Conversely, 442 participants were randomized to the placebo group, having a similar mean age (46.8 ±8.7 years), % of females (59.6%), and mean BMI (29.2 kg/m2) to the intervention group (Table 1).3.3.Meta-Analysis of Mg Supplementation versus Placebo on Serum Inﬂammatory Parameters Table 2 shows the effect of Mg on serum inﬂammatory parameters.
Among 737 par- ticipants in 15 RCTs, compared to placebo, Mg supplementation signiﬁcantly decreased serum CRP (SMD = −0.356; 95% CI: −0.659 to −0.054; p= 0.02) (Figure 2), although a high heterogeneity (I2= 74.8%) was observed. Similarly, Mg supplementation increased nitric oxide levels ( n= 3 studies; 194 participants; SMD = 0.321; 95% CI: 0.037 to 0.604; p= 0.026; I2= 0%) (Figure 3).On the contrary, in the meta-analyses performed with at least three studies, Mg supplementation did not affect the serum levels of IL-6, total antioxidant capac- ity, glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis factor alpha, whilst the effect on malondialdehyde (MDA) was at the limits of statistical signiﬁcance (SMD = −0.604; 95% CI: −1.224 to 0.017; p= 0.057; I2= 77.8%) (Table 2).Visual inspection of funnel plots and the Begg–Mazumdar Kendall tau and the Egger bias tests did not suggest the presence of publication bias.Table 2.Meta-analysis of magnesium supplementation on serum inﬂammatory parameters.

Meta-Analysis of Mg Supplementation v ersus Placebo on Serum Inflammatory Parameters Table 2 shows the effect of Mg on se rum inflammatory parameters.Among 737 participants in 15 RCTs, compared to plac ebo, Mg supplementation significantly de- creased serum CRP (SMD = −0.356; 95% CI: −0.659 to −0.054; p = 0.02) (Figure 2), although a high heterogeneity (I2 = 74.8%) was observed.
Similarly, Mg supplementation increased nitric oxide levels ( n = 3 studies; 194 participants; SMD = 0.321; 95% CI: 0.037 to 0.604; p = 0.026; I2 = 0%) (Figure 3). On the contrary, in th e meta-analyses perfor med with at least three studies, Mg supplementation did not affect the serum levels of IL-6, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis fa ctor alpha, whilst the effect on malondial- dehyde (MDA) was at the limits of statistical significance (SMD = −0.604; 95%CI: −1.224 to 0.017; p = 0.057; I 2 = 77.8%) (Table 2).Visual inspection of funnel plots and the Begg– Mazumdar Kendall tau and the Egger bias tests did not suggest the presence of publication bias.
Among the inflammatory parameters having less than three RCTs, Mg supplemen- tation significantly reduced plasma fibrinogen, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13B, Tu morigenicity 2 protein, and IL(interleukin)-1, while no significant variations were observed on IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum amyloid.

Meta-Regression Analysis Supplementary Table S2 reports the data of the meta-regression taking the differ- ence between treated with Mg and treated wi th placebo in serum CRP at the follow-up evaluation, as outcome. The only factor that was able to explain the heterogeneity of this outcome (I2 = 75.6%) was the difference in the percentage of women between the two groups (beta = 0.06; 95%CI: 0.004 to 0.11; p = 0.03) meaning that each increase in one per- centage point in the difference of women between groups corresponded to an increase in 0.06 units of CRP (R2 = 39%).4.Discussion The present meta-analysis including 17 RCTs with more than 800 participants found that, when compared to placebo, Mg suppl ementation significantly reduced serum CRP levels, thus supporting previous literature [14,15].In addition, we found that Mg sup- plementation increased NO levels.
Considering the inflammatory markers, assessed at least from three RCTs, no other significant variations were reported compar ing the treated vs. placebo groups.Interest- ingly, although not statistica lly significant, three such important markers IL-6, GSH and MDA showed a reduction in treated groups compared to the baseline indicating that further studies are required to confirm these findings and render possible the formula- tion of stronger conclusions.In particular, it is important to understand the effects of Mg intake on IL-6 levels [40], which is secreted by T cells and macrophages and acts as both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokine.Therefore, IL-6 may be both an indicator of acute inflammation, or undetected infection [40].
In addition, as this topic is attracting increasing attentio n, recent evidence reported that Mg supplementation sig- nificantly improved the reduction of plasma fibrinogen [36,41], tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5, TNF ligand superfamily member 13B, ST2 protein, and IL-1 [34,42]. Moreover, it has been reported that Mg de ficiency, in animal models, may increase the recruitment of phagocytic cells to perfor m their effector functions, which ultimately Figure 3.Forrest plot of the effect of magnesium versus placebo on serum nitric oxide [17,32,33].Among the inﬂammatory parameters having less than three RCTs, Mg supplemen- tation signiﬁcantly reduced plasma ﬁbrinogen, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 , tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13B, Tumorigenicity 2 protein, and IL(interleukin)-1, while no signiﬁcant variations were observed on IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, ery- throcyte sedimentation rate, and serum amyloid.3.4.
Risk of Bias The risk of bias assessment is fully reported in Supplementary Table S1. In general, the risk of bias was generally low.Only one RCT [ 35] had a suspicious high risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors.However, in the sequence generation 7/17, in the allocation concealment and in blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors 3 RCTs over 17 were at unclear risk of bias.3.5.Meta-Regression Analysis Supplementary Table S2 reports the data of the meta-regression taking the difference between treated with Mg and treated with placebo in serum CRP at the follow-up eval- uation, as outcome.
The only factor that was able to explain the heterogeneity of this outcome (I2= 75.6%) was the difference in the percentage of women between the two groups ( beta = 0.06 ; 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.11; p= 0.03) meaning that each increase in one percentage point in the difference of women between groups corresponded to an increase in 0.06 units of CRP (R2= 39%). 4.Discussion The present meta-analysis including 17 RCTs with more than 800 participants found that, when compared to placebo, Mg supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced serum CRP levels, thus supporting previous literature [ 14,15].In addition, we found that Mg supple- mentation increased NO levels.Considering the inﬂammatory markers, assessed at least from three RCTs, no other signiﬁcant variations were reported comparing the treated vs.placebo groups.
Interestingly, although not statistically signiﬁcant, three such important markers IL-6, GSH and MDA showed a reduction in treated groups compared to the baseline indicating that further stud- ies are required to conﬁrm these ﬁndings and render possible the formulation of stronger conclusions. In particular, it is important to understand the effects of Mg intake on IL-6 lev- els [40], which is secreted by T cells and macrophages and acts as both a pro-inﬂammatory and an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine.Therefore, IL-6 may be both an indicator of acute inﬂammation, or undetected infection [ 40].In addition, as this topic is attracting increasing attention, recent evidence reported that Mg supplementation signiﬁcantly improved the reduction of plasma ﬁbrinogen [ 36,41], tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5, TNF ligand superfamily member 13B, ST2 protein, and IL-1 [34,42].
Nutrients 2022 ,14, 679 7 of 10 Moreover, it has been reported that Mg deﬁciency, in animal models, may increase the recruitment of phagocytic cells to perform their effector functions, which ultimately leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species leading to an increased production of several cytokines involved in the inﬂammatory cascade, such as TNF- α[43]. At the same time, the release of these cytokines is induced by an increased level of intracellular Ca2+, which is considered a signal to start the inﬂammatory process and this condition could occur in case of Mg deﬁciency [ 44].Moreover, other in animal and in vitro studies have indicated that pro-inﬂammatory cytokine production induced in case of Mg deﬁciency involves the pathway of NF κβ, with a consequent higher production of TNF- αand IL- 1β[45].
Therefore, it is likely that all the systems involved in Mg deﬁciency may affect the inﬂammatory response in several ways and, in particular, through a modulation of intracellular calcium that regulates several pathways involved in inﬂammation [42]. Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis showing that Mg can improve NO levels.This ﬁnd could be crucial not only in terms of inﬂammatory mechanisms, but also from a cardiovascular point of view with a potential clinical impact.Interestingly, there is evidence showing that low Mg levels are associated with increased atrial ﬁbrillation and coronary heart disease risk, while Mg supplementation is implied in the secondary prevention of cardiac arrhythmias [ 46,47].Indeed, in vitro and in vivo animal studies have discovered a number of new electrophysiological properties of NO [48].
Finally, another interesting result of our systematic review and meta-analysis is that in meta-regression analyses the difference in percentage of females at baseline between treated and placebo groups was associated with a higher effect of Mg supplementation on serum CRP levels. Whilst it is known that males and females have signiﬁcantly different levels of Mg not only in serum, but also in other biological ﬂuids [ 49], the exact reason of the effect of Mg being more efﬁcacious in females than in males in lowering serum CRP levels is not known and, therefore, future research is warranted.The results of this meta-analysis should be considered taking in account its limitations.First, the RCTs included were small in sample size, had a limited follow-up time, and used different doses and types of Mg; therefore, the clinical applicability of our ﬁndings should be conﬁrmed in higher quality RCTs.Second, several studies did not include the assessment of Mg introduced in the diet.
However, it may be hypothesized that no signiﬁcant difference in this parameter was present between treated and placebo groups due to randomization. The role of dietary Mg on the effect of Mg supplementation should be better determined.Third, for several outcomes, we were not able to run a meta-analysis since these outcomes were included in less than 3 studies.Finally, when considering the outcome with the largest number of studies, i.e., serum CRP , it was characterized by a high heterogeneity that we were able to explain only partly with the meta-regression analyses.5.Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the beneﬁcial effects of Mg supple- mentation in signiﬁcantly reducing different inﬂammatory markers, in particular CRP and increasing NO levels.These data open new scenarios in clinical practice suggesting the importance of considering Mg supplementation in patient categories, with particular focus on cardiovascular diseases.
Considering the presence of inconsistent but potentially useful data regarding Mg supplementation, further studies are desirable to corroborate and better clarify these ﬁndings.
