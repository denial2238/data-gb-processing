With the availability of various preoperati ve education interv entions (POEIs), understanding which POEI results in impro vement in patient outcomes across the procedures is imperati ve. Objecti ve: This study aims to determine which POEI could be the most effective on patient outcomes by systematically reviewing all the POEIs reported in the literature.Methods: In total, 4753 articles investig ating various POEIs (eg, videos, presentations, mobile apps, and one-on-one education or coaching) were collected from the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases.Inclusion criteria were adult patients under going abdominal laparoscopic surgery, randomized controlled trials, and studies that provided postoperati ve outcomes.Exclusion criteria included studies not published in English and with no outcomes reported.
Title and abstract and full-te xt articles with POEI randomized controlled studies were screened based on the above criteria through a blinded, dual review using Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation). Study quality was assessed through the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.The included articles were analyzed for educational content, interv ention timing, interv ention type, and postoperati ve outcomes appropriate for a particular surgery.Results: Only 17 studies matched our criteria, with 1831 patients under going laparoscopic cholec ystectomy , bariatric surgery (gastric bypass and gastric sleeve), and colectomy .In total, 15 studies reported a statistically signif icant impro vement in at least 1 patient postoperati ve outcome.None of these studies were found to have an overall high risk of bias according to Cochrane standards.
In total, 41% (7/17) of the included studies using direct individual education impro ved outcomes in almost all surgery types, while educational videos had the greatest statistically signif icant impact for anxiety , nausea, and pain postoperati vely (P<.01). Direct group education demonstrated signif icant impro vement in weight, BMI, exercise, and depressi ve symptoms in 33% (2/6) of the laparoscopic gastric bypass studies.Conclusions: Direct education (individual or group based) positi vely impacts postoperati ve laparoscopic surgery outcomes.Trial Registration: PROSPER O CRD42023438698; https://www .crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=438698 (JMIR Perioper Med 2024;7:e51573) doi: 10.2196/51573 KEYW ORDS patient; education; surgeries; laparoscopic; postoperati ve; outcomes; systematic review JMIR Perioper Med 2024 | vol.7 | e51573 | p.

The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol is a systematic approach to minimize postoperati ve pain, complications, and duration of hospital stay in patients under going surgical procedures [2-4].The protocol, established by the ERAS Society , a not-for -prof it multiprofessional multidisciplinary medical-academic society , aims to determine the optimal approach for delivering care to patients under going surgical procedures, with the goal of facilitating quick er postoperati ve recovery [4].The ERAS protocol consists of patient education, preempti ve analgesia, and other practical procedures to impro ve patient outcomes [4,5].
The ERAS protocol continues to be implemented in a wide range of surgical fields and has been shown to signif icantly decrease patient complications from 35.7% to 16.4% in a prospecti ve cohort study in 2016 [6]. As the ERAS protocol demonstrates, patient compliance after laparoscopic abdominal surgery is essential to reducing postoperati ve complications [7].Nonadherence to the recommendations set by the surgical team, such as medication consumption or general lifestyle suggestions, can have a signif icant impact on postoperati ve recovery and patient complications [1,8].For instance, studies have documented that poor compliance in patients under going gastric banding surgeries results in poorer outcomes, including reduced weight loss postoperati vely [9].
Educating patients on their surgical procedure, potential postoperati ve consequences, and preventive steps to minimize complications has impro ved patient compliance and reduced hospital stays following laparoscopic surgery [5,10]. These preempti ve measures may play a profound role in mitig ating the psychological burden of pain, anxiety , and fear during recovery [11].Objecti ves As the laparoscopic approach in surgical procedures is considered to be newer, the research following its patient education for postoperati ve care is limited [12].To adapt to these novel approaches, modernized educational formats that have been shown to impro ve surgical patient outcomes includeverbal, written, multimedia, mobile apps, and one-on-one or group counseling [11,13,14].As interv ention types continue to be explored, there is no gold standard preoperati ve education interv ention (POEI) that has shown consistent impro vement in patient outcomes across the procedures.
The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature on POEIs to ascertain which POEI is more effective in impro ving outcomes in patients under going laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Methods Our review adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and EQUATOR (Enhancing the Quality and Transparenc y of Health Research) guidelines This protocol is registered in the PROSPER O database (CRD42023438698) [15].Sear ch Strategy A systematic search was performed using 3 databases: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus.The search strate gy was developed through an iterati ve process, using the methodology recommended by the Study Center of the German Society of Surgery, and included key terms related to laparoscopic abdominal surgeries and patient education [16].The full search algorithm was used to identify potential articles in all 3 databases (Multimedia Appendix 1).
Article Selection A total of 4753 articles investig ating POEI were collected from the 3 databases after the remo val of duplicates. Inclusion criteria were inclusion of a patient education interv ention, adult patients under going abdominal laparoscopic surgery, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and articles including postoperati ve outcomes (Figure 1).Exclusion criteria were articles not published in English, no patient education interv ention included, nonabdominal laparoscopic procedures, pediatric patients, and articles without outcomes reported.Eligibility criteria are described using the population, interv ention, comparator , outcomes, timing, and setting frame work (Table 1).Title and abstract and full-te xt articles were screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria via a blinded, dual review with 2 independent reviewers using Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation).
If the decision was not unanimous, discrepancies were resolv ed after further review until a consensus was reached to determine final article inclusion or exclusion.

Some interv entions included the usual preoperati ve care along with the education interv ention • If applicable, preoperati ve measures were compared to postoperati ve measures in the interv ention group and between in- tervention and control group Outcomes • Inclusion • Outcomes analyzed • Varied between interv ention type (ie, nausea, pain, anxiety , fatigue, percentage of unexpected hospitalizations, quality of life, weight, caloric intak e, complication rate, first exhaust time, first defecation time, intensi ve care unit admissions, BMI, exercise, depressi ve symptoms, Self-Care Mean Agenc y scores, Body Image Scale scores, and postoperati ve patient compliance) • Exclusion • Articles without outcomes reported • Outcomes were categorized into 3 categories: patient discomfort, surgical outcomes, and quality of life Timing • Interv entions with any follow-up period were included Setting • Any care setting (including in-patient clinics or outpatient and ambulatory care) Data Extraction and Analysis and Study Quality Study quality was assessed through the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool as all included studies were RCTs [17].
Each domain assessed (ie, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selecti ve outcome reporting, and other sources of bias) were evaluated as “high, ” “low,” or “unclear” risk of bias. An abstraction form was developed through an iterati ve process to standardize the data extraction process (Multimedia Appendix 1).Data extraction was performed via a blinded, dual review with 2 independent reviewers on Covidence, with any discrepancies resolv ed after further review.Study variables analyzed in this systematic review included educational content, interv ention timing and duration, interv ention type, surgery type, and postoperati ve outcomes related to a particular surgery.POEIs included educational videos, multimedia presentations, mobile apps,direct individual education, and direct group education.
All extracted data were compiled for analysis using Google Sheets (Google Drive; Google, LLC). Results Literatur e Selection Using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, the initial search yielded 6131 articles, of which 1378 (22.5%) duplicates were remo ved, leaving 4753 (77.5%) articles.Of the 4753 articles, during the title and abstract screening, we excluded 4713 (99.2%) and included 40 (0.8%).During the second phase, after a full-te xt review of the 40 articles, 17 (42.5%) were included in this systematic review.From the 17 studies that matched the inclusion criteria, 15 (88.2%) reported a statistically signif icant impro vement in ≥1 patient postoperati ve outcomes (Table 2) [18-34].JMIR Perioper Med 2024 | vol.7 | e51573 | p.4 https://periop.jmir .org/2024/1/e51573 (page number not for citation purposes)Maheta et al JMIR PERIOPERA TIVE MEDICINE XSL•FO RenderX Table 2.Summary of the included articles.

Nausea was signif icantly (P<.05) reduced in 2 interv ention types. Following laparoscopic cholec ystectomy , 43 patients who recei ved direct individual education demonstrated a decrease in postoperati ve nausea, as measured by the Mini Nutritional Assessment test and the simplif ied Apfel scale [21].Educational videos preoperati vely also proved to decrease patients’ reporting of nausea [30,32].The educational video study by Toğaç and Yılmaz [32] was conducted on 124 patients, and the results were obtained using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).The study by Stergiopoulou et al [30] was conducted on 60 patients, and the results were obtained using the Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 to 10.These 2 studies demonstrated statistical signif icance.Pain was reduced postoperati vely following 2 main interv entions: direct individual education [21] and educationalvideos [18,30,32,34].
Direct individual education and educational videos displayed a statistically signif icant reduction in pain (P<.05 and P<.01, respecti vely). The educational video study conducted by Abbasnia et al [18] included 145 patients, and results were obtained with the VAS and McGill Pain Questionnaire.Yayla and Mene vşe [34] analyzed 66 patients via the VAS.Anxiety was shown to be statistically decreased (P<.01) in POEIs that incorporated both educational videos [18,30] and presentations [33].The educational video interv ention used by Abbasnia et al [18] included 145 patients and collected data via the State-T rait Anxiety Inventory .While Stergiopoulou et al [30] collected data via the Amsterdam Preoperati ve Anxiety Scale and Information, Udayasankar et al [33] focused on 50 patients and reported a reduction in preoperati ve anxiety (P=.003) and postoperati ve anxiety after 6 hours (P=.001).JMIR Perioper Med 2024 | vol.7 | e51573 | p.

Percenta ge of unexpected hospitalizations postoperati vely was not signif icantly reduced when direct individual education interv ention type was introduced [31].Complication rate, ICU admission, first exhaust time,and first defecation time were all reduced postoperati vely when patients were debriefed via individual education or coaching interv ention [25,27].Molenaar et al [27] included 251 patients and measured their results via Comprehensi ve Complication Index (P=.02).Li et al [25] obtained their results via observ ation indicators.
Quality of Life Factors that affect quality of lifewere also considered to have a detrimental effect on a patient’ s long-term well-being. This category consisted of patient outcome factors such as weight , BMI, caloric intak e, exercise, depressive symptoms , fatigue , Self-Car e Mean Agency scores, and Body Image Scale scores.Patient weight was found to be statistically signif icantly decreased in both direct individual and group education POEIs (P<.01) [23,24,28,29].Petasne Nijamkin et al [29] and Nijamkin et al [28] included 144 patients in a group education setting and reported weight loss in patients who recei ved a POEI 12 months postoperati vely (P<.001).Kalarchian et al [23,24], using a structured interv ention, included 40 patients in a direct individual education method and had patients lose weight in the POEI arm at 4 months (P=.003).
BMI was also found to be statistically signif icantly decreased in patients provided with direct group education or coaching (P<.01) [28] and in patients provided with a POEI using a mobile app (P<.05) [22]. Deniz Doğan and Arslan [22] included 51 patients in the mobile app interv ention and recorded a reduced BMI (P<.05) in the first 3 months postoperati vely.Caloric intak ewas statistically decreased (P<.05) when patients recei ved a direct individual education POEI [24].An increase in exerciseand a decrease in depressive symptoms was found to be statistically signif icant (P<.01) when patients recei ved a direct group education POEI [28,29].In the study by Nijamkin et al [28], exercise was measured via the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health Enhancing Physical.In the study by Petasne Nijamkin et al [29], depression was measured via the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire and demonstrated a decrease in depression incidence after 12 months (P<.001).
Patient fatigue postoperati vely was decreased when patients were given an educational presentation (P=.008) [33]. Self-Car e Mean Agency scores and Body Image Scale scores had no signif icant increase in patients when provided with a POEI via a mobile app [22].Deniz Doğan and Arslan [22] assessed Self-Car e Mean Agency scoresvia a Likert-type Scale ranging from 0 to 4 with 35 items and Body Image Scale via a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5 with 40 items.The direct group education interv ention had a signif icant positi ve effect on weight, BMI, exercise,and depressive symptoms for patientsafter laparoscopic bariatric surgery, suggesting potential future physician consideration as a preferred interv ention choice [28,29].Direct Individual and Direct Group Education POEIs included direct individual education, direct group education, video education, multimedia presentations, and mobile apps.
Direct individual education methods included supervised and personalized training programs lasting from 1 to 3 months postoperati vely as well as nutritional guidance delivered by nurses and physicians via in-person sessions or telehealth [19,27]. POEIs that incorporated personalized training programs led to a decrease in the rate of severe complications (P<.05) and anxiety (P<.05) [19,27].Direct individual education also involved personalized preoperati ve education brochures and advice given by the patient’ s surgeon, which reduced nausea postoperati vely (P<.05) [21].In addition, patients recei ved postoperati ve portion-controlled meal deliveries and counseling over 4 weeks, provided by a registered dietitian, leading to weight loss (P<.01) and reduced caloric intak e (P<.05) [24].
Direct group education POEIs for bariatric surgeries involved 4 to 6 comprehensi ve lifestyle and behavioral or motivational sessions with the research teams and registered dieticians, and it resulted in a signif icant decrease in weight, BMI, and depressi ve symptoms (P<.01) and a signif icant increase in exercise (P<.01) [28,29]. Educational Videos and Multimedia Presentations Video education modalities involved short animations that served the goal of assuaging anxiety and operati ve fear.These animations were shown to the patient up to 3 times preoperati vely and daily postoperati vely for 1 week, which led to decreases in anxiety , pain, and nausea (P<.01) [18,34].
Likewise, preoperati ve multimedia presentations administered by registered nurses in the form of CDs and additional animations or brochures provided additional material to the patient before surgery, educating patients about the primary purpose of the surgery, preoperati ve examinations, and potential complications [20,30,33]. These POEIs led to statistically signif icant decreases in anxiety and fatigue in patients under going laparoscopic cholec ystectomy (P<.01) [20,30,33].Mobile App Finally , mobile app POEIs developed by the research teams allowed patients to access educational resources on their own time, and it included information about postsur gical care, weight tracking, nutrition, and exercise regimens with recovery goals during the first 3 months of surgery [22,26].
Patients recei ving this POEI experienced a decrease in BMI (P<.05); however, there was no statistically signif icant decrease in Self-Care Mean Agenc y scores, Body Image Scale scores, or postoperati ve patient compliance [22,26]. Discussion Principal Findings In this systematic review of RCTs, 17 studies were included, analyzing a total of 1831 patients.Approximately 38% (3/8) of the laparoscopic cholec ystectomy studies tested an educational JMIR Perioper Med 2024 | vol.7 | e51573 | p.16 https://periop.jmir .org/2024/1/e51573 (page number not for citation purposes)Maheta et al JMIR PERIOPERA TIVE MEDICINE XSL•FO RenderX video, which led to a statistically signif icant decrease in postoperati ve anxiety , pain, and nausea [18,30,32,34].Nearly 50% (7/17) of the studies included in this review found that direct individual education impro ved outcomes for a variety of surgical procedures.
Educational videos were most effective at reducing anxiety , nausea, and pain after surgery [18,30]. In about 33% (2/6) of the studies on laparoscopic gastric bypass, direct group education was shown to be effective in impro ving weight, BMI, exercise, and depressi ve symptoms.To decrease postsur gery complication rates, ICU admission, as well as first exhaust and defecation time for patients, direct individual education POEIs can be implemented before surgery [25,27].Direct Individual Education and Direct Group Education Direct individual education was the most effective POEI across all included procedure types: laparoscopic cholec ystectomy , bariatric surgery, and colectomy [19,21,23-25,27,31].
Direct individual education has been shown to be effective in other surgical procedures as it provides patients with a personalized interv ention tailored to their specif ic needs, which allows for patients to freely communicate and better understand their condition, treatment plan, and postoperati ve care [36,37]. For example, in hip or knee arthroplasty , patient education led to a signif icantly shorter length of stay (P<.001), suggesting that the effectiveness of one-on-one education or coaching found in this review is not only limited to abdominal laparoscopic procedures [10].Direct group education had signif icantly impro ved outcomes across laparoscopic gastric bypass for weight, BMI, exercise, and depressi ve symptoms (P<.01) [28,29].A group setting allows for bonding with others and building a support system, which can be a critical influence toward lifestyle changes necessary for impro ved outcomes after bariatric surgery [38,39].
In a prior systematic review analyzing POEIs in patients under going major surgery, the authors found that increased frequenc y of message exposure impro ved outcomes; however, this review suggests that the frequenc y of message exposure may not be as important as POEI type since all frequencies of one-on-one and group education or coaching POEIs had similar effectiveness across all procedure types [13]. Although the included studies incorporated in-person direct individual and group education, there are emer ging technologies, such as virtual reality , that offer a new avenue to provide patients with individual or group education and coaching through a distanced modality [40,41].Educational Videos and Multimedia Presentations POEIs with educational videos or a presentation had the most statistically signif icant impro vements on anxiety , pain, and fatigue after laparoscopic cholec ystectomy (P<.01) [18,20,30,32-34].
The use of videos to educate patients allowed for increased standardization, cost-ef fectiveness, and accessibility due to the prerecorded nature of this interv ention that can be applied broadly throughout multiple disciplines of medicine [42,43]. Incorporation of educational videos also allows for patients to recei ve the POEI from the convenience of their own home and reduces health care inequity related to access to transportation and proximity to the hospital [44-46].Preoperati ve video education has been shown to impro vephysical symptoms in the literature, as suggested by this review; however, this POEI has also been shown to impro ve knowledge, preparedness, satisf action, psychological well-being, quality of life, and health care use in other surgery types [47].Presentations allow for patients and caregivers to engage with the material and ask questions to better understand the content [48].
Both forms of POEI have demonstrated effectiveness in impro ving specif ic patient outcomes based on the content of the education; if the content is tailored toward focusing on additional aspects of the patient’ s postoperati ve recovery, more patient outcomes may be impro ved [49]. Mobile Apps Newer forms of technology are also being tested for POEIs; however, more development is required within this area.In the 2 interv entions that leveraged a mobile app for their POEI, there was impro vement in BMI (P<.01); however, no statistically signif icant impro vement was observ ed in Self-Care Mean Agenc y scores, Body Image Scale scores, or postoperati ve patient compliance [22,26].
Although there were limited signif icant impro vements in patient outcomes while using mobile apps, coupling newer technology with aspects of tested POEIs, such as in-person education, educational videos, or presentations, may be a feasible option to optimize patient outcomes after laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Use of mobile apps in plastic surgery has been shown to signif icantly impro ve understanding of the surgery and postoperati ve patient compliance; this suggests that this modality of POEI has the potential to also impro ve patient quality outcomes for abdominal laparoscopic procedures if researched further [14].Benef its of using technology through mobile apps, virtual reality , or artificial intelligence may provide increased accessibility to populations with limited mobility or access to clinical settings.These forms of communication can serve as a vital platform for enhancing the patient-ph ysician rapport [50-53].
There are challenges associated with implementing these tools as the technology of these POEIs encompasses the associated expenses, accessibility , and maintenance. In addition, these platforms will require extensi ve training to ensure a user-friendly platform for different patient populations [54,55].Limitations This study can be considered in light of the following limitations.First, the tools to report patient outcomes were not consistent across the included studies, thus a meta-analysis or further synthesis is not possible.Second, only laparoscopic cholec ystectomy , bariatric surgery (ie, gastric bypass and gastric sleeve), and colectomy surgeries were included because these were the only available surgery types with RCTs published regarding POEI.
The heterogeneity of the included studies within the review provides a more diverse and holistic review of the published POEIs, which allows a narrati ve analysis of the pros and cons of individual interv entions in each type of surgery included; however, it limits the ability to statistically compare the interv entions to determine the most efficacious POEI in laparoscopic abdominal surgery. There are numerous types of abdominal laparoscopic surgeries where POEI may be benef icial, but they were not included in this systematic review due to a lack of published RCTs.Some included studies did not JMIR Perioper Med 2024 | vol.7 | e51573 | p.

This limited the quantif ication of the effects of these features and their relationship with outcomes as there was signif icant variability in the published literature.Furthermore, the included studies may have been used for a more comprehensi ve, multidisciplinary interv ention, confounding their direct impact on patient outcomes.However, this study provides informati ve insights into the current knowledge base pertaining to POEI and its applications in the field of abdominal laparoscopic surgeries.
Conclusions This systematic review analyzed 17 RCTs that demonstrated the effect of POEIs on postoperati ve patient outcomes after abdominal laparoscopic surgeries. A total of 1831 patients under going laparoscopic cholec ystectomy , bariatric surgery (ie,gastric bypass and gastric sleeve), or colectomy were included in this analysis, and 15 studies reported a statistically signif icant impro vement in at least 1 patient postoperati ve outcome.Overall, direct individual education was the most effective POEI across all included procedure types; direct group education had the most signif icantly impro ved outcomes primarily among bariatric surgeries.POEIs that incorporated educational videos or presentations demonstrated the most statistically signif icant impro vements in anxiety , pain, and fatigue following laparoscopic cholec ystectomy .
Direct education, whether individual or group based, has been shown to have a more positi ve impact on postoperati ve outcomes than newer POEIs, such as mobile apps. The practicality of this allows surgeons to personalize the health care delivered to each patient and provide the appropriate POEI based on which outcomes are more important for that patient.Future directions include expanding the use of POEIs to additional surgical procedures and further testing POEIs that incorporate more recent technology .Conflicts of Inter est None declared.Multimedia Appendix 1 Search strate gy and abstraction guide.[DOCX File , 213 KB-Multimedia Appendix 1] Multimedia Appendix 2 PRISMA Checklist.[PDF File (Adobe PDF File), 284 KB-Multimedia Appendix 2] Refer ences 1.Ceresoli M, Brag a M.Reply to: early non compliance to enhanced recovery pathw ay might be an alert for underlying complications following colon surgery.Eur J Surg Oncol.Feb 2023;49(2):526.
