Methods: Twelve older adults (M =6, W =6, 58 ±3y e a r s ) consumed creatine monohydrate (CM) and placebo for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Pre- and post- supplementation, participants underwent a fasted venous blood draw.Plasma levels of cholesterol (CHOL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides(TG),non-HDLcholesterol(nHDLc),lowdensitylipopro- tein (LDL), very LDL (vLDL), and glucose (GLU) were then analyzed usingaPiccoloXpressclinicalchemistryanalyzer.Resultswereanalyzed by 2×2 Repeated Measures ANOVA, with significance accepted as p <0.05.Results: Following CM supplementation there were significant improvements in fasted TG (Pre: 99.81 ±35.35 mg/dL, Post: 83.82 ± 37.65mg/dL,p <.05)andGLU(Pre:103.64 ±6.28mg/dL,Post:99 ± 4.9mg/dL, p<.05),incomparisontoplacebo.Therewerenosignificant changes following CM in LDL, HDL, nHDLc, or CHOL.
There was a significant main effect of time in that vLDL decreased in both groups onaverage–2.46mg/dL Conclusions: Our findings indicate that 4 weeks of CM supple- mentation led to a significant improvement in TG and GLU, but failed to improve CHOL, LDL, HDL, or nHDLc. Considering the correlation between triglycerides and glucose and pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, these results suggest potential for creatine to serve as an adjuvant therapeutic.However, further research isrequiredtouncoverpotentialmechanismsbywhichcreatinemaybe exertingthesenovelbenefits.Funding Sources: AmericanCollegeofSportsMedicine-Doctoral ResearchGrant CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
