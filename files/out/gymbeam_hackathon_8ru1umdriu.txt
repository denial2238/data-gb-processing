PCR-conﬁrmed infected cattle were divided into control and treated groups. Selenium and vitamin E were administered to the treated group.Post-therapy, there were notable improvements in hematological indices and reduced serum nitric oxide and malondialdehyde levels.A strong correlation was found between serum nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and genetic damage.Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that substantially improved genotoxicity in treated animals.In conclusion, LSD induces oxidative stress and genotoxicity in cattle, effectively mitigated by Selenium and vitamin E therapy.Abstract: Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a contagious infection of cattle caused by a virus of the Poxviridae family, genus Capripoxvirus.In Pakistan, recent outbreaks have resulted in signiﬁcant nationwide mortality and economic losses.
A 20-day prospective cohort study was performed on sixty infected cattle with the aim to evaluate LSD-induced oxidative stress’s genotoxic role and to determine the ameliorative effect of antioxidant therapy using principal component analysis (PCA) and a multivariable ordinal logistic regression model. LSDV was identiﬁed from scab samples and nodular lesions using RPO30-speciﬁc gene primers.The infected cattle were divided into control and treated groups.The animals were observed initially and ﬁnally on day 20 to evaluate the homeostatic, oxidative, and genotoxic changes.The animals in the treated group were administered a combination of selenium (Se) and vitamin E at the standard dose rate for ﬁve consecutive days.A substantial ( p< 0.05) improvement in the hematological indices was observed in the treated group.The treated group also showed a signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05) reduction in levels of serum nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) post-therapy.
The PCA at the ﬁnal sampling data of the treated group showed that Principal Component (PC1 eigenvalue 1.429) was inﬂuenced by superoxide dismutase (SOD; 0.3632), catalase (CAT; 0.2906), and glutathione (GSH; 0.0816) and PC2 (eigenvalue 1.200) was inﬂuenced by CAT (0.4362), MDA (0.2056), and NO (0.0693). A signiﬁcant correlation between serum NO (76%) and MDA levels (80%) was observed with genetic damage index (GDI) scores.The ordinal logistic regression model regarding the use of antioxidant therapy revealed 73.95-times (95%CI; 17.36–314.96) improvement in the GDI in treated animals.The multivariable ordinal logistic regression showed that each unit increase in NO and MDA resulted in a 13% increase in genotoxicity in infected individuals.In conclusion, our study revealed that LSD-induced oxidative stress and lipid Vet.Sci.2023 ,10, 643.https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci10110643 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vetsci Vet.Sci.

Furthermore, the combined Se and vitamin E therapy signiﬁcantly alleviated oxidative stress and genotoxicity in LSD-affected cattle.Keywords: Lumpy skin disease; Pakistan; comet assay; tocopherol; selenium; oxidative stress; genotoxicity 1.Introduction LSD is a highly contagious infection of the Capri pox genus that primarily affects cattle and buffaloes.This transboundary virus has recently reemerged as a major issue [ 1].The livestock industry suffers signiﬁcant economic losses [ 2].The World Organization for Animal Health has classiﬁed LSD as a disease with substantial impact [3].In Pakistan, a total of 190,000 cases of LSD have been documented across the country, resulting in a signiﬁcant case fatality with more than 7500 deaths.Conversely, a substantial number of 141,000 animals have recovered from the infection [ 4].
Potential ﬁnancial ramiﬁcations for Pakistan due to LSD can be extrapolated from Ethiopian statistical data. The median economic deﬁcit attributable to each deceased animal in Ethiopia was evaluated to be USD 375.Additionally, there was an estimated USD 141 loss in milk production for every cow affected by the disease.By drawing parallels from these ﬁgures, one might infer the prospective economic consequences for Pakistan in the face of an LSD outbreak.[5].LSD mainly spreads through blood-sucking arthropods such as stable ﬂies and ticks [ 2].Direct contact between healthy and infected animals is not considered the transmission route of infection [ 6].This condition is characterized by fever, extreme lethargy, and skin nodules that spread to the mucous membranes and internal organs [ 7–9].Lesions in inter- nal organs result in gastrointestinal and respiratory issues such as ruminal atony, dyspnea, and pneumonia [10].It is common for outbreaks to occur in epidemics [11].
However, un- explainable gaps of several years between epidemics, irrespective of factors, are commonly observed [ 12]. The infection alters hematological and biochemical parameters while trigger- ing oxidative stress [ 13,14].Oxidative damage is a leading cause of many acute and chronic disorders resulting from the overproduction of free radicals and weakened antioxidant capacity [ 15].Elevated levels of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation biomarkers have been observed in the infected animals [13,14,16].Furthermore, the oxidative stress itself and through induced lipid peroxidation prod- ucts, including MDA, further results in genotoxicity in the body [17,18].Among the various antioxidants, vitamin E and selenium (Se) exhibit a unique feature in that they function synergistically to combat lipid peroxides (ROOH).
Vitamin E can directly engage with lipid free radicals (ROO •), while Se is an essential trace mineral [ 19] which serves as the principal co-factor for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) which is an essential enzyme facilitating the conversion of lipid peroxides into inert compounds [ 20]. Using these natural antioxidants has been shown to mitigate the negative consequences of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 21].Both Se and vitamin E have been speciﬁcally aimed at enhancing the metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and bolstering the immune and anti-inﬂammatory responses in dairy cattle [ 22].Vitamin E has been also been reported to have the capability of reducing genotoxic effects [23].However, to our knowledge, limited information is available regarding the impact of oxidative stress levels and lipid peroxidation products on the genotoxicity of blood lymphocytes of LSDV-infected animals.
Therefore, the present study was designed to eval- uate oxidative stress’s genotoxic role and determine the ameliorative effect of antioxidant therapy in LSD-affected cattle populations in Multan district, Pakistan. We performed correlation analysis and multivariable ordinal logistic regression to assess the precision of genotoxicity assessment and antioxidant therapy.Vet.Sci.2023 ,10, 643 3 of 14 2.Materials and Methods A 20-day prospective cohort study was conducted on sixty LSDV-affected cattle in Multan District, Pakistan.The individual animals were observed on day 0 to evaluate clinical and homeostatic changes (e.g., hematological, biochemical) due to the effects of LSD.The diseased cattle were divided into two categories: control and treated groups.As previously described, all the control and treated group animals were provided supportive treatment, including antipyretics, antihistaminics, and antibiotics [ 24].
To evaluate oxidative stress-induced genotoxicity in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the ameliorative effect of antioxidant therapy, the treated group was administered with Selevit Injection (Per ml containing Se 0.15 mg, Tocopherol 70 mg, Cyanocobalamin 0.1 mg, Adenosine 5-mono- phosphoric acid 5 mg, Fatro S.p.A, Ozzano dell’Emilia, Italy) at a dose rate of 10–20 mL/day for ﬁve consecutive days. The study was conducted in Multan District, Punjab, Pakistan (30.1575◦N, 71.5249◦E), and included various village cattle farms and dairy units.Initial indications of illness on the premises were documented approximately three months before the collection of samples, and physical assessments were carried out on affected livestock, as previously reported [ 25].The ethical guidelines of The College of Veterinary Sciences, Riphah International University, Lahore, were strictly followed, and all the samples were collected after obtaining permission from the corresponding owners (Rcvets-1150).
The initial sampling from the animals was conducted on the day symptoms ﬁrst appeared, with a ﬁnal sampling performed after 20 days (Figure 1). We obtained blood specimens through jugular venipunctures.To avoid bias, a single veterinary professional executed all tests and analyses involved in this study.Vet.Sci.2023 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14 However, to our knowledge, limited information is available regarding the impact of oxidative stress levels and lipid peroxida tion products on the genotoxicity of blood lym- phocytes of LSDV -infected animals.Therefore, the present study was designed to evalu- ate oxidative stress ’s genotoxic role and determine the ameliorative effect of antioxidant therapy in LSD -affected cattle pop ulations in Multan district, Pakistan.We performed correlation analysis and multivariable ordinal logistic regression to assess the precision of genotoxicity assessment and antioxidant therapy.2.
Materials and Methods A 20 -day prospective cohort study wa s conducted on sixty LSDV -affected cattle in Multan District, Pakistan. The individual animals were observed on day 0 to evaluate clin- ical and homeostatic changes (e.g., hematological, biochemical) due to the effects of LSD.The diseased cattle were divide d into two categories : control and treated groups.As pre- viously described, all the control and treated group animals were provided supportive treatment, including antipyretics, antihistaminics, and antibiotics [24].To evaluate oxida- tive stress -indu ced genotoxicity in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the ameliorative ef- fect of antioxidant therapy, the treated group was administered with Selevit Injection (Per ml containing Se 0.15 mg, Tocopherol 70 mg, Cyanocobalamin 0.1 mg, Adenosine 5 -mono - phosphor ic acid 5 mg, Fatro S.p.A, Ozzano dell’Emilia, Italy) at a dose rate of 1 0–20 mL/day for five consecutive days.
The study was conducted in Multan District, Punjab, Pakistan (30.1575° N, 71.5249° E), and included various village cattle farms and dairy units . Initial indications of illness on the premises were documented approximately three months before the collection of samples, and physical assessments were carried out on affected livestock, as previously reported [25].The ethical guidelines of The College of Veterinary Sciences, Riphah International University, Lahore, were strictly followed, and all the samples were collected after obtaining permission from the corresponding owners (Rcvets -1150).The initial sampling from the animals was conducted on the day symptoms first ap- peared, with a final sampling performed after 20 days (Figure 1).We obtained blood spec- imens through jugular venipunctures.To avoid bias, a single veterinary professional exe- cuted all tests and analyses involved in this study.Figure 1.
Indicates the timeline of the experimental procedure including initial sampling at day 0 followed by the treatment of infected animals for five consective days and final sampling at day 20. For hematology analyses, the specimens were collected in vacutainers coated with EDTA.Meanwhile, the blood specimens without EDTA were centrifuged at 3000 × g rev- olutions per minute (RPM) for 15 min and then stored at −20 ° C for biochemical investi- gations [26].Nodular lesions and scab samples were homogenized with a 50% phosphate - buffered saline (PBS) solution, diluted in 10% PBS, filtered through a 0.45 µM syringe fil- ter, and stored at −80 ° C until further use [ 11].The viral DNA was extracted by GeneJET Viral DNA/RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) per the manufacturer ’s instructions.
Previously reported primers targeting the viral attachment protein (RPO30 gene) (Forward 5′ -TCTATGTCTTGATATGTGGTGGTAG -3′, and Reverse 5′-AGTGATTAGGTGGTGTATTATTTTCC -3′) were used [27]. The PCR products were visualized with an Omega FlourPlus Gel Documentation System (San Francisco, CA, USA).The positive samples were expected to produce a 172 bp amplicon.An automatic hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to evaluate the hematological indices.Some oxidative stress parameters, such as CAT, were determined by colorimetric method using a commercial kit (CAT100 -1KT, Sigma -Al- drich®, St.Louis, MI, U SA).Reduced (GSH) and NO were estimated according to [28–30], Figure 1.Indicates the timeline of the experimental procedure including initial sampling at day 0 followed by the treatment of infected animals for ﬁve consective days and ﬁnal sampling at day 20.For hematology analyses, the specimens were collected in vacutainers coated with EDTA.
Meanwhile, the blood specimens without EDTA were centrifuged at 3000 ×g revolutions per minute (RPM) for 15 min and then stored at −20◦C for biochemical investigations [ 26]. Nodular lesions and scab samples were homogenized with a 50% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, diluted in 10% PBS, ﬁltered through a 0.45 µM syringe ﬁlter, and stored at −80◦C until further use [ 11].The viral DNA was extracted by GeneJET Viral DNA/RNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions.Previously reported primers targeting the viral attachment protein (RPO30 gene) (Forward 5′-TCTATGTCTTGATATGTGGTGGTAG-3′, and Reverse 5′-AGTGATTAGGTGGTGTATTATTTTCC-3′) were used [ 27].The PCR products were visualized with an Omega FlourPlus Gel Documentation System (San Francisco, CA, USA).The positive samples were expected to produce a 172 bp amplicon.
An automatic hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to evaluate the hematological indices. Some oxidative stress parameters, such as CAT, were determined by colorimetric method using a commercial kit (CAT100-1KT, Sigma- Aldrich®, St.Louis, MI, USA).Reduced (GSH) and NO were estimated according to [ 28–30], respectively.In the hemolysates, the SOD enzyme was assessed using the photooxidation method [31].The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the plasma samples were quantiﬁed using a colorimetric reaction method of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) [32].To perform the comet assay, lymphocytes were isolated from the sample.A mixture of 4 mL of Histopaque (lymphocyte separating media) and 3 mL of blood was prepared and centrifuged for 45 min at 800 ×gand 25◦C.The band of lymphocytes was then carefully aspirated and mixed with Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 Medium (RPMI).
After a second round of centrifugation for 10 min at 250 ×g, the pallet produced was re-suspended Vet. Sci.2023 ,10, 643 4 of 14 in 1 mL PBS before the Neubauer chamber was used to count them [ 33].Comet assay was conducted using the alkaline method [ 34].A sample of 10 µL (0.1×105cells) was placed into 0.2 mL polypropylene tubes and mixed with 75 µL of low-melting-point agarose (LMPA in 0.7% PBS) at 37◦C [35], smeared on 76 mm ×26 mm microscope slides coated with 1.5% normal-melting-point agarose in PBS, and heated to 60◦C.The slides were then left to dry overnight at 22◦C.After the agarose had solidiﬁed for 10 min at 4◦C, the coverslips were removed, and the slides were immersed in a lysis solution (100 mM Na2EDTA, 2.5 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO and 10 mM Tris-HCl) for 1 h at 4◦C.The slides were then set in a horizontal electrophoresis apparatus ﬁlled with a buffer comprising 300 mM NaOH and 1 mM Na 2EDTA at 4◦C.
The slides were incubated for 40 min in the buffer to unfold the DNA. The electrophoresis was performed at 25 Volts (0.83 V/cm) for 20 min and 300 mA in the dark to prevent DNA damage.The slides were washed thrice with neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), followed by a single wash with 100% ethanol [36].Slides were exposed to freezing water, prepared for microscopy, and then cells from the slides were examined.The comet tail length of the cells was used to categorize them into four groups: 0, intact cells; I, cells with a head diameter of the nucleus equal to or greater than the tail length; II, cells with a head diameter of the nucleus less than the tail length but with a tail length less than double head diameter; and III, cells with tail lengths more signiﬁcant than twice their head diameter [ 37].The slides were then analyzed using Casplab version 1.2.3 beta 2 for the comet head and tail parameters.The genetic damage index was calculated as described by Aroosa et al.

Indices with eigenvalues above 1.0 were classiﬁed as PC, with the higher one being known as the ﬁrst PC [ 38]. An ordinal logistic regression model was employed to analyze the effect of oxida- tive stress parameters and antioxidant therapy on the likelihood of a change in genotoxicity using Minitab®21.3.1 (64-bit).A Pearson’s test was conducted to assess the goodness of ﬁt of the model.The measure of association between the model’s response variable and the predicted variable was analyzed using Goodman–Kruskal Gamma.Furthermore, the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests, was used to compare the mean rank sums of the comet assay scores among both groups at different sampling points using GraphPad Prism version 9.5.A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant [39,40].3.Results 3.1.

PC2 followed closely with an eigenvalue of 1.194 (23.88% of the variance).For PC1, the NO had the highest positive contribution (0.3754), followed by GSH (0.4218), and then MDA, CAT, and SOD.Conversely, MDA had the highest positive contribution (0.3225) to PC2, with SOD (0.3664) also contributing signiﬁcantly.The PCA of the treated group at initial sampling revealed the eigenvalues for PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, and PC5 were 1.509, 1.138, 0.8747, 0.8564, and 0.6213, respectively.
In PC1, the NO exhibited a minimal positive contribution (0.0011), whereas MDA and GSH showed notable contributions of 0.2565 and 0.1308, respectively. CAT contributed signiﬁcantly (0.3775), and SOD also had a discernible positive inﬂuence (0.2341).PC2 was primarily inﬂuenced by the NO (0.6522).The eigenvalues for each PC in the control group at the ﬁnal sampling stage were as follows; PC1 (1.470), PC2 (1.274), PC3 (1.200), PC4 (0.7659), and PC5 (0.2904).For PC1, the NO had a substantial contribution (0.3557), followed by GSH (0.1370) and SOD (0.4496).Meanwhile, in PC2, GSH exhibited the highest contribution (0.4471), followed by NO (0.3989) and MDA (0.1511).The PCA summary of the treated group at ﬁnal sampling data revealed that PC1 accounted for 28.59% of the total variance (eigenvalue of 1.429).PC2 represented 23.78% of the variance, while PC3, PC4, and PC5 accounted for 17.70%, 16.25%, and 13.69%, respectively.
In PC1, SOD (0.3632) was recorded as the most signiﬁcant variable, followed by CAT (0.2906) and GSH (0.0816). Conversely, PC2 was predominantly inﬂuenced by CAT (0.4362), MDA (0.2056), and NO (0.0693) (Figure 5).The multivariable ordinal logistic regression results regarding the inﬂuence of NO, MDA, GSH, CAT, and SOD on GDI did not show a signiﬁcant ( p> 0.05) effect in the model.However, the bivariable model analysis revealed that each unit increase in NO and MDA resulted in a 13% (OR; 0.87 95%CI; 77–99 and 95%CI; 82–93, respectively) increase in the genotoxicity of infected individuals.Based on the results of the Pearson test ( p =1.000), the model analysis regarding NO and MDA revealed a statistically signiﬁcant impact.Moreover, the ordinal logistic model regarding the use of antioxidant therapy revealed 73.95-times (95%CI; 17.36–314.96) increase in the chances of amelioration in the GDI score in treated animals as compared to the control animals.
Pearson’s test showed the model’s goodness of ﬁt ( p =0.843), whereas the Goodman–Kruskal gamma value (0.91) deﬁned the perfect association between the response variable and the predicted probabilities.

Discussion LSD has been classified as a transboundary livestock disease because it has the po- tential to spread between countries and have significant economic, trade, and food secu- rity implications [41]. The present study focuses on the correlation of oxidative stress markers with the extent of DNA damage using comet assay parameters and the amelio- rative use of Se and vitamin E antioxidants in LSD -affected cattle under natural conditions in Pakistan.PCR i s the most reliable technique for confirming the presence of LSDV and has been found to have a high sensitivity when detecting its genome in skin nodules [7].The high level of virus detection through PCR testing may be explained by the virus’ tendency to affect the skin and its ability to remain at high concentrations in cutaneous tissues [13].In addition, the infected animals had depleted leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eo- sinophils, which suggests a viral infection [42].
Excessive corticosteroid pro duction de- creases the number of lymphocytes [41]. The present study ’s findings align with previous result s [6,13 ].Previous studies have also observed thrombocytopenia mainly due to short- ened platelet lifespan [13,25 ].Systemic vasculitis is often the underlying trigger in LSDV infection due to endothelial damage leading to excessive platelet consumption.In response to viral infection, the activation of cellular stress mechanisms in infected cells is a complicated process that simultaneously stimulates cell survival and death mech- anisms.Poxviruses utilize the cellular de -novo biosynthesis of fatty acids, with a particu- lar emphasis on the synthesis of palmitates.Each o f these molecules undergo the process of beta -oxidation within the mitochondria.Additionally, in conjunction with the catabo- lism of glutamine, they produce acetyl -CoA and alpha -ketoglutarate, respectively [43].
Both molecules are utilized as substantial energy sources within the infected cells as sub- stitutes for the glucose TCA cycle [44–46].

Excessive corticosteroid production decreases the number of lymphocytes [ 41]. The present study’s ﬁndings align with previous results [ 6,13].Previous studies have also observed thrombocytopenia mainly due to shortened platelet lifespan [ 13,25].Systemic vasculitis is often the underlying trigger in LSDV infection due to endothelial damage leading to excessive platelet consumption.In response to viral infection, the activation of cellular stress mechanisms in infected cells is a complicated process that simultaneously stimulates cell survival and death mech- anisms.Poxviruses utilize the cellular de-novo biosynthesis of fatty acids, with a particular emphasis on the synthesis of palmitates.Each of these molecules undergo the process of beta-oxidation within the mitochondria.Additionally, in conjunction with the catabolism of glutamine, they produce acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate, respectively [ 43].
Both molecules are utilized as substantial energy sources within the infected cells as substi- tutes for the glucose TCA cycle [ 44–46]. Through this metabolic pathway, oxygen plays a Vet.Sci.2023 ,10, 643 10 of 14 crucial role as the primary electron acceptor in the electron transport chain of oxidative phosphorylation.This process generates water (H 2O) and other ROS [ 47,48].ROS induce detrimental effects on cellular structures, such as protein denaturation, lipoperoxidation, and DNA degradation.However, ROS can serve as a secondary messenger in the modula- tion of inﬂammation, promoting cell proliferation and regulating apoptosis, all of which contribute to maintaining the cellular homeostasis [ 49–52].Due to cytotoxic activity, antiox- idant enzymes and vitamins tightly limit cellular ROS levels.These mechanisms are called oxidative stress responses [48].
Meanwhile, elevated nitric oxide (NO) production is typically attributed to the induc- tion of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which is frequently expressed by immunological phagocytes, epithelial and neuronal cells [ 53–55]. iNOS has the potential to release an increased and sustained amount of nitric oxide compared to neuronal NOS or endothe- lial NOS.iNOS is expressed ubiquitously during in vivo viral replication.The induction of iNOS during virus infection is upregulated by pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as interferon- γ(IFN- γ) [50].Furthermore, IFN- γis linked to activating type 1 helper T cell (Th1) responses [ 56].The outcomes show that IFN- γis essential in inducing the overex- pression of iNOS and NO, which are involved in the progression of viral infection [ 57].MDA is the primary lipid peroxidation marker extensively explored as an oxidative stress biomarker.The extent of oxidative stress can be determined by measuring the concentration of MDA [ 58,59].
Endogenous aldehydes, such as MDA, are highly reactive and capable of forming aldehyde-derived DNA adducts, which result in DNA damage [60]. So far no research study has worked on the relationship between NO and MDA levels with DNA damage as reﬂected in the comet assay.Our results showed a positive relationship between serum levels of NO and MDA with the GDI, thus suggesting that LSDV-induced oxidative stress may result in DNA damage in infected animals.The GDI scores of the individuals revealed a strong correlation (80%) with serum MDA and (76%) NO levels, indicating that oxidative stress-induced MDA production in LSD is directly linked with genotoxicity in the infected animals.Moreover, the results are supported by the ordinal logistic regression model ﬁnding, which showed that each unit increase in the serum level of NO and MDA results in a 13% increase in the odds of genotoxicity in infected animals, respectively.
Genotoxicity was also negatively correlated with the antioxidant capacity of the cattle. Serum GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were negatively associated (83%, 84%, and 87%, respectively) with genetic damage.Vitamin E’s primary function as an antioxidant is to capture lipid peroxyl radicals, which initiate and propagate lipid oxidation [ 61,62].Se is a structural component of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin.It counters the toxic effects of some toxic chemicals and protects the tissues against free radical injury [ 63,64].Furthermore, in the present study, the combined therapy of animals with Se and vitamin E was effective against oxidative stress and genotoxicity in the LSD-affected animals.Results of ordinal logistic regression revealed that using antioxidant therapy results in almost 74-times increased odds of amelioration in the genotoxicity compared to the individuals of the control group.
The results are consistent with previous studies, which showed that Vitamin E and Se can signiﬁcantly reduce oxidative stress-induced genetic damage to peripheral lymphocytes [65–68]. 5.Conclusions In conclusion, our study revealed that LSD-induced oxidative stress and lipid per- oxidation products including NO and MDA, cause genotoxicity in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of affected animals.It is further suggested that the intervention of antioxidant therapy combined with supportive treatment results in the signiﬁcant amelioration of the hematological indices, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity in LSD-affected cattle.Vet.Sci.2023 ,10, 643 11 of 14 Supplementary Materials: The raw data recorded during experimentation used for analysis can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/vetsci10110643/s1.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, W.A.and A.S.; methodology, W.A., M.A.(Mehmood Ahmad), M.W.A., A.I.and R.M.Z.M.; software, W.A.; validation, M.Y.T.
