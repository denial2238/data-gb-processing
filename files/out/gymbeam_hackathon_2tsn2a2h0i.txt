The study involved 761 mothers and their chil dren. After analysis of the inclusion and exclusion criterion, the information provid ed by women 699 aged 21–48 years was included in the ﬁnal data analysis.In the study gro up, most children were breastfed for 6 months to 1 year ( n=256, 36.7%), 1 year to 2 years ( n=179, 25.6%) and over 2 years ( n=71, 10.2%).Starting dietary expansion before 17 weeks of ag e wasimplementedin47(6.7%)children,betweenand17–26wee ksofagein328(46.9%) children,andafter26weeksofagein324(46.3%)children.F eedingfoodanddishesfrom the family table was practiced by 518 (74.1%) mothers.Spoon -feeding was practiced by 529 (75.6%) children, 157 (22.4%) children were fed this w ay sometimes.Taking into account the above data, feeding with the BLW method was u sed in 170 children (24.2%).In the examined group of mothers the use of the BLW me thod in feeding their children, especially during diet expansion, was declared b y 408 women (74.8%).
The child’s independent decision concerning what the child wil l eat and what is according to the BLW method is accepted by 434 (62.1%) mothers. Among the p ositive aspects of using the BLW method, the women surveyed indicated the child ’s independence, while among the disadvantages, the omnipresent mess and chaos whe n eating meals.Keywords: Child Nutrition, Baby Led Weaning (BLW), expandi ng the diet of infants, complementary feeding, child diet INTRODUCTION In the postnatal period, and especially in the ﬁrst 33 months of a child’s life, nutrition is a form of synbiotic directed at the gastrointestinal tract, more spec iﬁcally at the intestinal microbiota, with a regulatory eﬀect on the gut-brain axis.Because of this issu e, it is important to shape pro-healthy eating habits in children ( 1).The recommended way of diet expansion, which at the same time introduces alotofcontroversies,isthe Baby Led Weaning (BLW)feeding model ( 2,3).ThePolish Białek-Dratwa et al.
Practical Implementation of the BLW Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Child Nutritio n (PTGHiZD) deﬁnes this method of feeding as feeding with the omission of mushy consistency served with cutlery, with the exclusive implementation of solid consistency eaten by an in fant on its own ( 4). It is a method of expanding and supplementing feeding between 17 and 26 weeks of age ( 4).According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a baby should be breastfed exclusively with breast milk for the ﬁrst 6 months.After the introduction of complementary foods, WHO and ESPGHAN recommend continuing breastfeeding for as long as desired by mother and child ( 5,6).WHO recommends starting the introductionofcomplementaryfoodsaroundthesixthmontho f a child’s life ( 6).On the other hand, ESPGHAN and PTGHiZD recommend starting the introduction of solid foods after th e 17th and no later than the 26th week of a child’s life.
These two diﬀerent positions may confuse parents as to when they should start expanding the child’s diet ( 4,5). The introduction of new products to the infant’s diet also aims to prepare the infant for a more varied diet later in life, including learni ng tastes and textures ( 7,8).In most infants, between 17 and 26 weeks of age, the ability to accept solid foods matures.It is not until the infant is 17 weeks old that the gastrointestina l tract and kidneys are mature enough for the infant to assimil ate non-dairy foods.The swallowing reﬂex and the ability to acc ept puréed food from a spoon appear between 4 and 6 months of age.The introduction of foods before the age of 3–4 months also carries a risk of allergy ( 5).Infants between 17 and 26 weeks of age develop the ability to sit with support, acquire neuromuscular maturity that allows them to control head and neck movements, and to eat from a spoon.
At this time, the reﬂex to remove foreign bodies from the mouth, which made feeding with food other than liquid diﬃcult, ceases ( 4–6). All these aspects allow for the introduction of feeding with the B LW method.Numerous parents’ doubts about its use, not based on scientiﬁc reports (Evidence-Based Medicine—EBM), focus on the fear of nutritional deﬁciencies (especially of microele ments, e.g., iron, zinc, vitamin B 12), growth retardation, disorders of psychomotor development, and choking deﬁned as a life- threatening condition involving partial or complete obstruct ion of the upper airways.Often their concerns also relate to wasti ng food,aswellastheappearanceoftheenvironmentafterthechi ld has eaten a meal on their own ( 2,4).In the BLW method, eating togetherasafamilyandatmealtimesisimportant.Thisapproac h can give the infant more control over food intake.This can lead to better eating patterns and reduce the risk of overweig ht and obesity.
Given the self-selection of parents and infants who currently use the BLW method, and the limited observational data available however, it is not possible to draw conclusion s. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on whether infants who are traditionally spoon-fed receive suﬃcient nutrients, in cluding energyandiron,orwhethertheyconsumemoreortheyconsume a greater variety of foods.ESPHGAN indicates that these iss ues shouldbeinvestigatedinRCTs.AmodiﬁedversionofBLWcall ed BLISS—emphasizes the importance of introducing iron- and energy-richenergy-richcomplementaryfoodsandtheavoida nce offoodsthatmaypresentchokinghazards.Asmallobservatio nal pilot study suggests that this approach had some beneﬁt inTABLE 1 | Proposal of implementation of complementary products.

increasing iron-rich foods consumed by infants ( 4,5). In a study by Neves et al.( 9) note that there is still insuﬃcient scientiﬁc and quality evidence to conﬁrm that the BLW method is the most appropriate form of feeding into the diet of infants.Health professionals from New Zealand and Canada were concerned about the potential for energy and iron deﬁciencies in BLW children, which can cause disruption to children’s growth and normaldevelopment( 9–11).In response to these concerns, suggestions for safe products adapted to the age of the child can be made, based on the experience of a specialist in clinical and pediatric dietetics( 12)(Table1).Anothermethodaimedatpartiallyalleviatingparents’anxie ty isBaby-Led Introduction to Solids (BLISS).This modiﬁcation consistsinintroducingproductsadaptedtothechild’sdevel oped body motor mechanism, followed by biting, chewing and swallowing, and fortiﬁcation in the presence of iron.
When implementing both dietary models, it is important to keep in mind the sensory sensitivity of the child without leading to the appearanceofaversion( 13,14).Thesensorydiversityofchildren is an important issue, so three criteria referring to the leve l of inclination toward the child’s food preferences should be ta ken into account ( 15) (Table2). BLISS resources are consistent with the BLW philosophy but address three key concerns that some health professionals have expressed about BLW: inadequate ir on intake, choking and stunted growth.By: checking foods befo re serving to make sure they are soft enough, avoiding foods tha t formacrumbinthemouth,foodsshouldbeatleastaslongasth e baby’sﬁst,atleastonesideofthefood,thebaby’ssittingpo sition so they sit up straight while eating—never leaning back, tha t an adult is always with the baby, and that the baby does not put whole foods in their mouth—the baby needs to do this at their ownpaceandundertheirowncontrol( 16).
Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 890843 Białek-Dratwa et al. Practical Implementation of the BLW TABLE 2 | Examples of sensory diversity among children.The tendency to the child’s food preferences(1) Food habituation to milk consumption with a concomitant desire to consume introduced new products (vegetables, fruit, eggs, porridge, meat) occurs in breastfed and artiﬁcially mixed children (2) Eating habits focusing exclusively on milk consumption through breastfeeding and the introduction of artiﬁcial mixtures—modiﬁed milk, with aversion to new complementary products (3) Food habits focusing on food aversion toward milk in the form of a bottle and breastfed, but sensory inclination toward complementary products initially in thick form served with a spoon (porridge, soups, fruit), then in solid form (pieces of products).Ownelaborationbasedonwhatdohappytoddlerseat?NutritionalPublishers ,2020(15).
The key inﬂuence on the positive eﬀects of their application and the introduction of complementary foods is the clinical condition of the infant. Simultaneously occurring symptoms of food neophobia or food selectivity and the period of product administration (preferably after 6 months of age), the acceptance of known foods (facilitates the introduction of new products), the method of breastfeeding (brings many beneﬁts), as well as the prenatal period in the past inﬂuence the way of expanding the diet of a small child.According to the concept of metabolic programming, already the diet of a pregnant woman shows an inﬂuence on the composition of amniotic ﬂuid, and this, in time, will inﬂuence the way of diet expansion in an infant and his/her willingness to learn new tastes ( 17–20).The use of dietary expansion methods in the form of BLW or BLISS predisposes to the appearance of elements of dietoprophylaxis and health prevention in the later stages of a child’s adolescence.
They include low risk of metabolic diseases (overweight, obesity, hybrid diabet es), correct regulation of the hunger and satiety center—contro l of physiological hunger, developed on a diﬀerentiated, ration al level eating habits by regulating the food given by the infan t independently. Therefore, it is the toddler who will decide on the number of portions in conditions devoid of emotional pressure by the parents, with all the hygienic and safety rules monitored by them, maintained during the meal.It should be mentioned that among the pro-health elements there is also the education of parents and the use of the family table method.Next, it seems important to shape motor skills among infants and an independent relationship with food, as well as to stimulate the child’s masticatory system(21–23).The aim of the study was to verify the knowledge of the Baby Led Weaning feeding model among mothers of children up to 3 yearsofageandtheirpracticalimplementationofthismethod .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Test Group An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted from Apri l to June 2021 among randomly selected 761 mothers and theirchildren, aged up to 3 years, residing in Upper Silesia. Mothers were recruited at randomly selected nurseries and pediatric clinics during mandatory vaccination visits.A list of public and private nurseries has been compiled, as well as a list of pediatri c clinics where vaccinations are carried out for children age d 0–3 years—these establishments are both public and non-public an d have a contract with the Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia (National Health Fund), which ﬁnances vaccinations in Poland.We have deﬁnedrandomizationnurseriesandpediatricoutpatientclin ics.10 nurseries and 10 pediatric outpatient clinics were drawn from the list.In each nursery and pediatric clinic 40 parents of children aged 0–3 years were invited to participate in the stud y.
All participants were informed about the purpose of the study, voluntary participation in the study, and anonymity, and were asked to accept the data sharing policy. After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, information collected f rom 699 womenwasincludedintheﬁnalanalysis.Due to the nature of the study, consent was sought from the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Silesia i n Katowice.By the Resolution No.KNW/0022/KB1/151/I/11 the Bioethics Committee issued a positive opinion on the project.ThestudyisinaccordancewiththeDeclarationofHelsinki.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria were: female sex, having a child aged 0–3 6 months (up to 3 years) of age, consenting to the study, and completingthequestionnairecorrectlyandcompletely.
On the other hand, the criteria for exclusion from the study were: lack of consent to participate in the study, incorrectly completed questionnaire, including non-response to question s, andthechild’sageabove36months. Research Tool Theresearchtool was asurvey questionnaire,whichconsisted of several parts.The survey was conducted personally by qualiﬁe d interviewers who were thoroughly trained on how to ﬁll in the questionnaires—they were students of Dietetics at the Medic al University of Silesia in Katowice.The questionnaires were ﬁ lled in and entered by the interviewers in electronic form using tablets.The ﬁrst part was a metric that asked women about their age, place of residence, education, height, and body we ight.In the study conducted at the pediatric outpatient clinic, all childrenhadtheirweightandlength/heightmeasuredbynur ses.Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 890843 Białek-Dratwa et al.
Practical Implementation of the BLW In the nursery, on the other hand, weight and length/height measurements were taken by staﬀ employed in the institution. Mothers,ontheotherhand,enteredtheirownweightandheigh t.There were also questions about the current work situation, education, marital status, number of children, and age of th e youngestchild.The next part of the questionnaire concerned the basic knowledge about expanding the diet of a child and expanding the diet of a child using the BLW method.The part of the questionnaire concerning the method of extending the diet of a child included questions about the time of starting and the method of extending the diet of a child, the use of the BLW method, and indicating the advantages and disadvantages of this method or risks in independent eating by a child.
At the same time, the questionnaire included questions about giving food to the child from the family table, feeding the child with a spoon, allowing the child to decide independently what and how much to eat, the order of introducing particular food products to the diet, the consistency of meals from which the expansion of the child’s diet should begin, the type of thermal processing used to prepare meals, the time when the child received sweets for the ﬁrsttime. The questionnaire was based on current dietary recommendations for the group of the youngest children and the method of dietary expansion developed by PTGHiZD (4).A pilot study was conducted on a group of 50 mothers in order to validate the questionnaire and to check the relevance and acceptability of the questions included in it.Reproducibility of responses was tested by comparing responses in the same group of subjects.Pilot study 2 took place 1 month after the pilot study to avoid freshness eﬀects.
To assess the reproducibility of the results obtained with the questionna ire used, the xparameter (Kappa) was calculated for each question in the questionnaire (results obtained in the pilot study and pilot study 2). For 67.3% of the questions, a very good ( x≥ 0.80) concordance of responses was obtained, and for 28.4% of the questions a good (0.79 ≥x≥0.60) concordance of methods was obtained.For only 4.3% of the questions in the questionnaire analyzed, the concordance between the resul ts obtained at baseline and in the repeat survey was moderate ( x <0.59).Also analyzed, Cronbach’s αcoeﬃcient for the normalization sample was 0.87, which indicates high reliability and repeatability of the questionnaire.The pilot study allowed us to validate the questions included in the questionnaire.Cronbach’s alpha for the relevant part of the study was estimatedat0.86.Statistical Analysis Statisticalanalysiswas performed using the software in Sta tistica v.13.1 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
Non-parametric tests were used for statistical elaboration. Diﬀerences between g roups were tested by Pearson’s Chi-square test, with Fisher’s exa ct, Yates, and the level of statistical signiﬁcance was taken at p <0.05.TABLE 3 | Characteristics of the study group of mothers.

Of the 545 mothers who declared knowledge of the BLW method, 480 (88.1%) considered this method asappropriate.The use of the BLW method in feeding their children, especially during diet expansion, was declared by 408 (74.8%) women.
The implementation of this model of feeding by the examined women was induced by the child’s independence, due to the accelerated psychomotor development ( n=202; 37.0%), the wish to familiarize the child with various tastes and to s hape thesensorydiversity( n=55;10.1%),thedesiretobroadenfamily ties by using the method of eating from the family table ( n= 50;9.1%).Theobservationsmadebymothersduringtheprocess of dietary expansion with the BLW method were mainly the occurrence of mess ( n=147, 36.0%), the necessity to feed the child(n=15,3.7%),foodwastage( n=13,3.2%),lackofmaturity ofthechildfortheBLWmethod( n=7,1.7%)andtreatingfood asagame( n=3,0.7%).Asmanyas45(11.1%)mothersindicated theoccurrenceofafoodchokingincident. Independent eating by children was indicated by 563 (80.5%) mothers.The child’s independent decision concerning what to eat, which is in accordance with the BLW method, is accepted by 434 (62.1%) mothers.
39 (5.6%) mothers do not allow their children to choose what to eat and 15 (2.15%) of them do not allow their children to decide how much to eat(Table6).

A statistically signiﬁcant relationship was found—those m others who declared the use of BLW more often use these elements in the process of expanding the child’s diet than those who did not makesuchadeclaration.DISCUSSION Balanced nutrition, dietary supplementation, and the nutrit ional status of the pregnant woman are of great importance in terms of the nutritional status of the child at diﬀerent stages of psychomotor and neurodevelopmental development.Learning the principles of healthy eating starts at an early age.
The development of individual food preferences that consist of learning about and getting used to new tastes contributes to t he acquisition of healthy eating habits that will bear fruit in the future. An indispensable component for this is the nutritiona l knowledge of the parents, who introduce meals to their child i n thepostnatalperiod( 26,27).In the author’s study, the degree of women’s knowledge was characterized by a high level.The analysis of our results al lows us to state that the elements from the scope of knowledge concerning BLW: knowledge of the method, terminology, and the validity of its use constituted more than a good level, at the same time taking into account the extension of this scope of issues using the Internet.Comparing the study of Brown and Lee it shows an analogy with the author’s analysis because also the degree of the range of skills?was also at a high level, but t he subjectswereinformedbyhealthprofessionals( 28).
The process of introducing complementary products to breastfeeding as well as for babies fed with modiﬁed milk is important for the baby’s microbiome. This is due to the type of food products that contain natural prebiotics such as fruct o- oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides.By expand ing the baby’s diet and introducing products such as yogurt, keﬁr, buttermilk and products fortiﬁed with probiotics we inﬂuence Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 890843 Białek-Dratwa et al.Practical Implementation of the BLW TABLE 8 | Relationship between BLW use and sociodemographic factors .

By taking advantage of the regionality of product groups and relying on products such as sauerkraut, pickled cucumbers and other pickles, we promote the formation of an immunomodulatory barrier. Popular Polish regional products such as sauerkraut, pickled cucumbers and fermented milk products contain probiotic bacteria.Additionally, prod ucts specially enriched with probiotic bacteria can be purchased on the Polish market.It has been shown that probiotic bacteria, through colonization in the intestines of the host, among ot her things,reducetheriskofgrowthofpotentialpathogenicbact eria and aﬀect the anatomical-physical and microbiological barri ers of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as aﬀect the immunity of the macroorganism, including the local immunity of the gastrointestinal tract ( 29–32).
It has been found that diﬀerent strains of bacteria, even though they belong to the same speci es, can have diﬀerent eﬀects on the organism, so when selecting bacteria used in probiotics, it is important to choose those th at showgoodclinicaleﬀects( 31,33). Probiotic bacteria show a wide spectrum of action, including stimulating the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) immune system—also called the common mucosal immune system (CMIS) ( 34,35).The MALT or CMIS system is formed, among others, by elements of immunity of the gastrointestinal tract (GALT—gut associated lymphoid tiss ue), respiratory system (BALT—bronchus associated lymphoid tissue), genitourinary associated lymphoid tissue (GUALT) ,and skin SALT—skin associated lymphoid tissue.
The immune response of the MALT system, is characterized by activation of natural and acquired immunity mechanisms, through production of a whole range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, as well as immunoglobulins class: G, M, A, including secretory immunoglobulins S-IgA and S-IgM ( 34– 37). As the last mentioned antibodies, min.by coating and agglutinatingmicroorganisms,theypreventtheiradhesion tothe gastrointestinal epithelium, although they also show regula tory eﬀects, including through S-IgM antibodies, on elements of the immune system.
Thus, the MALT system shows not only a combative or destructive eﬀect against bacteria, viruses, f ungi and parasites, but also causes neutralization of bacterial a nd fungaltoxinsProbioticsshowasigniﬁcanteﬀectontheeleme nts of the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract (GALT), which results in increased local, but also general immunity, which in turn leads to a reduction in the impact of infections, including bacterial, viral and other on the macroorganism. This eﬀect is combined with and depends on the appropriate strain of bacteria used in the probiotic and this is, it seems, crucia l for a good eﬀect in the use of probiotics, although its eﬀect is also inﬂuencedbyitsdoseandtimeofadministration,butalsobyt he immunestatusofthemacroorganism( 30,31,36–41).

The knowledge of the principles of dietary expansion of infants translates into the level of frequency of its application.Our study shows the reﬂection of knowledge in the frequency of BLW implementation by mothers.
The universality of this form of dietary expansion is conﬁrmed by the results of a study by other authors, which also allowed to demonstrate a relation ship between a higher level of education and an increased frequen cy ofusingthemethodofintroducingsolidproducts( 28). Nutritional patterns reﬂected in the parents’ diet are reproduced and implemented in children’s nutrition.The mechanism of metabolic programming has been shown to inﬂuence the pathomechanism of the development of metabolic and diet-related diseases, the regulation of leptin and ghre lin synthesis in the hypothalamus, and the nutritional status of the child ( 43,44).Based on scientiﬁc reports, the timing of administration of speciﬁc products is important to the occurrence of later eating habits.In the case of sweet produc ts, they should be introduced as late as possible and at least meet 5% of the energy value of the whole-day ration, due to strong taste habits.
The researchers Townsend and Pitchfor d proved the positive inﬂuence on health-promoting habits in the case of using the BLW method in comparison with children not eating this way, additionally demonstrating in them an increased inclination to sweet products ( 14,45). Additionally, the authors Brown and Lee emphasize the positive and safe quality of food prepared using the BLW method(28).Our results show the predominance of the mixed form of complementary feeding and the lower frequency of the full BLW method.Among mothers who did not use this method, an increased tendency not to give products from the family table was observed, as well as a more frequent lack of parents’consent to decide independently about the quantity and quali ty ofeatenproducts.
Theanalysisoftheauthor’sstudyshowsthatthedietarymode l wasexpandedtoincludevegetables,fruitsintheﬁrstplace,u sing favorable thermal treatment including methods such as boil ing, steaming, baking, stewing which are the correct techniques for preparing meals according to the nutritional recommendation s forchildren( 26). The variety of controversies arising around the BLW method is conditioned by the disadvantages and advantages attribu ted to this way of nutrition.The disadvantages include chaos during meal consumption, the possibility of choking, increas e in saturatedfatsupply,nutritionaldeﬁciencies,insuﬃcientco verage of nutritional ﬁber requirements, wasting of food ( 26,28).
The increased incidence of choking, which is the main concern among parents and health care professionals, is not conﬁrmed according to scientiﬁc reports, as it occurs similarly in spoo n- fed children and is regulated by the defense mechanism of the developedunconditionedreﬂexToavoidchoking,checkthefo od before serving to make sure it is soft enough. Avoid food that forms crumbs in the mouth or that can stick to the palate.The child should eat at his own pace and under his own control—no one should force the child to eat more quickly.Small foodstu ﬀs, such as chickpeas, grapes and blueberries, should always be mashedﬁrstandcutupproperly.Itisalsoforbiddentogivebaby nuts whole, but blended nuts in the form of nut butter, cashew butter or walnut butter can be given.The child should have a stablesittingposition whileeating—itshouldnot leanback orto thesides.Andanadultshouldalwaysbewiththechild( 45–47).
Among the elements inducing the implementation of BLW, according to the studies of other researchers and in the auth or’s study, the following are important: expansion of family ties through the use of the family table method, the pleasure of meal consumption, the formation of healthy eating habits (increa sed Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 890843 Białek-Dratwa et al. Practical Implementation of the BLW supply of vegetables, fruit, whole grain products), the taste a nd organoleptic diversity, the formation of independence in foo d consumptionandtheformationofself-controlintherelatio nship with food and, above all, the feeling of satiety ( 28,48,49).It is also worth noting that in our study it was observed that there is a percentage of mothers who, despite the lack of declaration ofusingtheBLWmethodwiththeirchild,implementinfeeding theirchildrenelementswhichareadeparturefromthetradit ional model of nutrition.
Such a relationship is also demonstrate d in thestudybyBrown( 50). Itisnecessarytoimplementcontinuousnutritionaleducati on on the nutrition of infants, children, as well as women planning pregnancy, with ongoing pregnancy and during lactation, including elements of psychodietetics based, fo r example, on motivational dialogue.The principles of anti- inﬂammatory dietoprophylaxis used among people trying to have a baby are common.The typical anti-inﬂammatory diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean protein, nuts, seed s, and omega-3 fatty acids.Many products are eliminated from the diet, incl.Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids include: high-fat dairy products (such as milk, cheese, butter, and ice cream), margarine, meats, peanuts.It is important that parents follow healthy eating principles when expanding their child’s diet rather than restrictively eliminating foods.
Such restrictions may predispose to food aversion, food neophobia and even to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (AFRI D) (51,52). CONCLUSIONS The level of women’s knowledge in the scope of dietary expansion of infants by the BLW method is high, taking into account the necessity of continuous nutritional education .The use of the mixed method of dietary expansion is dominant among the mothers participating in the study.The frequency of implementation of the BLW method depended on the level of education; women with higher education use it more often.Among the positive aspects of using the BLW method, the womensurveyedindicatethechild’sindependence,whileamo ng the disadvantages, mess, and chaos.There is a group of mothe rs who, despite not being identiﬁed with the BLW method, useits elements in the child’s everyday feeding, such as the chi ld decidingonitsownhowmuchandwhattoeat.LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY Theresultsofthestudyshouldbeinterpretedtakingintoacc ount its limitations.
