In a meta-bolic ward where the environment was str ictly controlled, we measured energy intake, energy expenditure, and energy output (fecal and urinary). The primary endpoint was the within-participant dif ference in host metabolizable energy between experimental conditions [Con trol, Western Diet (WD) vs.MBD].The secondary endpoints were enteroendo crine hormones, hunger/satiety, and food intake.Here we show that, compared to the WD, the MBD leads to anadditional 116 ± 56 kcals (P < 0.0001) los t in feces daily and thus, lower meta- bolizable energy for the host (89.5 ± 0.73%; range 84.2-96.1% on the MBD vs.95.4 ± 0.21%; range 94.1-97.0% on th eW D ;P<0 .0 0 0 1 )w i t h o u tc h a n g e si n energy expenditure, hunger/satiety or food intake (P > 0.05).
Microbial 16SrRNA gene copy number (a surrogate of biomass) increases (P < 0.0001), beta-diversity changes (whole genome shotgun sequencing; P = 0.02), and fer-mentation products increase (P < 0.01) on an MBD as compared to a WD alongwith signi ﬁcant changes in the host enteroendocrine system (P < 0.0001). The substantial interindividual variability in metabolizable energy on the MBD isexplained in part by fecal SCFAs and bi omass.Our results reveal the complex host-diet-microbiome interplay that modulates energy balance.Microbial communities in the colon have a profound effect on host physiology, including immune function, inter-organ communication, and metabolism1.The majority of studies in humans have correlated the gut microbiota ’s composition, gene expression, and metabolismwith human health endpoints such as body weight, glycemic control, and in ﬂammatory bowel diseases2,3.
What remains to be determined is whether the gut microbiome is a causal driver or merely a re ﬂection of host physiology4.Received: 18 January 2023 Accepted: 12 May 2023 Check for updates A full list of af ﬁliations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: Dr.Rosy@asu.edu ;Steven.R.Smith@AdventHealth.com Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,; The effect of the gut microbiome on weight regulation has been a topic of high interest5.Obesity is a major public health concern that is at the nexus of metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes 6.The gut microbiome has emerged as a control center for host energy balance through its impacts on energy harvest from food, gut hormones, and signalingthrough metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 5.Existing data are largely restricted to preclinical models or observationalstudies 7–9.
Prior controlled feeding studies have demonstrated that high- ﬁber diets are associated with reduced host metabolizable energy10and that varying dietary energy load can alter energy harvest efﬁciency in a way that correlates to phyla in the gut microbiota11. Despite these advances, studies to date lack a comprehensive quanti-tative evaluation of the contribution of the gut microbiome to theentire energy balance equation, including energy intake, energy expenditure, and fecal energy losses.Prior studies were also insuf ﬁ- ciently precise to detect potentially modest differences in the com-position of the gut microbiome, which can vary dramatically betweenindividuals, particularly when appropriate environmental controlswere not implemented.
To address these critical knowledge gaps, here we describe the results of the intersection of host-diet-gut microbiome factors onhuman energy balance generated by performing a controlled feedingstudy in a metabolic ward using a deep-phenotyping paradigm ofquantitative bioenergetics (NCT02939703) 12(Supplementary Fig. 1).The primary endpoint for the protocol was the within-participant dif- ference in 24-h fecal energy normalized to the total daily energy intake measured during the 6-day calorimetry block within each domicileddiet period.We hypothesized that with the MBD, there would behigher fecal energy (and thus lower host metabolizable energy) due tothe greater availability of dietary substrates to the colonic gutmicrobes 13.This hypothesis also was supported by our in silico math- ematical model14that predicted an additional 110 kcals of additional fecal energy loss on the MBD per 2000 kcal consumed as compared tothe WD.
The principal secondary endpoints tested hypotheses abouthow diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota might change enter-oendocrine hormone secretion, hunger/satiety, and food intake. These measures were evaluated during the ﬁnal two days of each domiciled diet period.With this paradigm, we ﬁnd that delivery of more dietary substrates to the gut microbiome leads to a net negative energy bal-ance that is accompanied by a robust remodeling of gut microbiotacomposition, diversity and function and changes in host enteroendo-crine hormones.Results Validation of study paradigm The details of participant ﬂow from enrollment through analysis are detailed in Supplementary Fig.2.The intervention implemented in this trial included a highly digestible control Western Diet (WD) and a Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD).
The MBD maximized the availabilityof dietary substrates to the gut microbiome and included four dietarydrivers: dietary ﬁber, resistant starch, large food particle size, and limited processed foods (Supplementary Fig. 1).Our design providedequivalent dietary metabolizable energy (kcal) and total macro-nutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates) based on classic principles andequations of food digestibility 15.Diets were prepared in our metabolic kitchen and validated by measuring energy content via chemical ana-lysis.Analysis of intake during the nine domiciled days that providedmeals exactly as designed (i.e., excluding an ad libitum feeding day anda gastric emptying test day which required a liquid meal) demon- strated that the diets consumed by study participants delivered the planned energy, macronutrients, and gut microbiome dietary drivers(Supplementary Table 1).
To avoid the confounding effects of over- or underfeeding on host and microbial metabolism, we evaluated energy balance by real-timeassessment of energy intake (personalized to the energy needs of each participant 12) and energy expenditure (measured via whole-room indirect calorimetry). We found that energy balance was maintainedwithin our target of ±50 kcals per 6-day calorimeter stay (WD 4.1 ± 5.1 kcal/day; MBD 5.4 ± 2.8 kcal/day; P= 0.8; Supplementary Fig.3a).Weight stability was a secondary criterion for evaluatingenergy balance, and we previously reported that weight was stableduring the 6-day calorimetry assessment period whilst the primaryendpoint was measured and data were being generated without a linkto diet assignment 12.Surveillance of adverse events revealed minimal gastrointestinal or other side effects that did not differ by diet (Supplementary Data 1).Adherence was equivalent between diets during the metabolic wardperiod (99.6 ± 0.19% on MBD vs.
99.9 ± 0.10% on WD, P=0 . 2 7 ; S u p - plementary Fig.3b).Therefore, our validated paradigm was well tol- erated by study participants.Participant characteristics Young, healthy, weight-stable individuals were enrolled to quantify whole-body bioenergetics without the confounding effects of age and metabolic disease16and to establish the comparative data needed for future studies enrolling people with various health conditions(Table 1).We excluded people with recent antibiotic use or chronic health conditions that were evaluated by medical history, physicalexam and standard clinical labs.The study sample was 30.8 ± 1.9 yearsof age, with a BMI within the normal weight to overweight range (Table 1).All participants reported normal stool patterns based on the Bristol Stool Scale 17and sleep duration of 5.95 ± 0.32 h (Table 1).

Free-living intake of macronutrients was similar to those in the study diets (Table 1).The total sleep period during the 6-days in the calorimeter (when our primary endpoint was measured) was held constant between diets (8 h; SupplementaryTable 2), which is important because sleep duration impacts hunger,circadian rhythms and downstream host and microbial phenotypes 19.
With our radar-based motion detector, we calculated motion-freesleep, which is a surrogate of high-quality sleep that we use to mini-mize the effects of small amounts of involuntary motion during sleepon sleep energy expenditure 20. We found that sleep was not different between the two diet conditions during the calorimetry stay (mean ±s.e.m.motion-free sleep duration was 3.5 ± 0.75 h on WD and 3.5 ± 0.5 hon MBD; Supplementary Fig.3c) Diet modulated host metabolizable energy The overall goal of our study was to modulate the gut microbiome andemploy a quantitative paradigm with enough precision to detectwithin-participant responses to the diet intervention.A key contribu-tion to understanding the role of the gut microbiome on energy bal-ance involves fecal energy.
Prior methods lack precision and oftenprovide results as energy per gram of feces, which does not con-textualize fecal energy in terms of dietary intake (which we preciselycontrolled) and makes it dif ﬁcult to interpret the relationships of fecal energy to host phenotypes 21. To this end, according to the method ofPak22, we administered a low, non-laxative dose of non-absorbable non-digestible polyethylene glycol (PEG) with each meal.We measuredthe PEG concentration in fecal samples to normalize each fecal mea-surement to 24-h based on expected daily PEG excretion.To quantify fecal energy loss, we used chemical oxygen demand (COD), a measure of electron equivalents in organic carbon 23a n da d j u s t e dt h er e s u l tt o PEG recovery.COD is typically used for microbial bioenergetics inenvironmental biotechnology 16.We previously reported that, for food items, COD correlates highly to the commonly used bomb calorimetrymethod ( R²=0 .9 7 ) 24.
COD is a less expensive alternative that provides relevant information for microbial electron balances, and more phy-siologically relevant measurements since COD does not include theoxidation of ammonia, which humans do not utilize as an electrondonor 23,24. Additionally, COD is advantageous because it simulta- neously measures electrons available to humans and microbes, thus enabling electron balances to quantify energy ﬂow23.B a s e do n this (fecal energy as COD adjusted to PEG recovery), the MBDincreased mean daily fecal energy losses, compared to the WD, overthe six calorimetry days of the domiciled controlled-feedingperiod (73.0 ± 6.1 gCOD/day on MBD vs.32.1 ± 2.5 gCOD/day on WD;P=2 .9 6 × 1 0 −7; Fig.1a).When fecal energy loss was adjusted to total energy intake to calculate host metabolizable energy (primary end-point), we found that it was lower with the MBD (89.5 ± 0.73% on theMBD vs.95.4 ± 0.21% on the WD (Fig.1b;P=2 .

COD Chemical Oxygen Demand, MBD Microbiome Enhancer Diet (green), WD Western Diet (purple).Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38778-x Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 3 Diet modulated the gut microbiome Given our primary ﬁnding that the MBD produced a signi ﬁcant decrease in host metabolizable energy compared to the WD, therebyreducing energy available to the host, we next evaluated the microbialphenotype associated with host energy balance. Mean daily fecalweight was higher on the MBD ( P=1 .2 4× 1 0 −5; Supplementary Fig.4a), and a proportion of this additional weight was due to a signi ﬁcant increase in 16S rRNA gene copy number ( P=5 .0 5 × 1 0−8;F i g .2a), a surrogate of fecal bacterial biomass.Supporting this result, the MBD was predicted by our in silico mathematical model25to produce 19.6 ± 3.5 gCOD/day of microbial biomass compared to 9.4 ± 1.2 gCOD/day on the WD, which is >25% of the total energy content of feces onboth diets.
Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), we evaluated whether the increase in bacterial biomass was accompanied by a change inmicrobial diversity. Alpha-diversity assessed by species richness andevenness did not differ between diets (Supplementary Fig.4b, c).Incontrast, beta-diversity showed signi ﬁcant and stark separation by diet whether evaluated by Bray –Curtis (Dis)similarity ( P=0 .0 2 ;F i g .2b) or Jaccard Similarity ( P= 0.02; Supplementary Fig.4d).To further explore the compositional changes in the microbiome associated with our two experimental diets, we derived regressioncoefﬁcients testing differences in microbial species relative abundance (WGS) by diet using MaAsLin2 ’s compound Poisson regression model, which adeptly handles zero-in ﬂated data 26,a n dc a p i t a l i z e so nt h estatistical power of the crossover design.
Although relative abundance did not differ between the diets at the phylum and family levels(Supplementary Table 3), we found 53 differentially abundant taxa atthe species level ( P< 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 5a, b), of which 10 had a Q< 0.05 and differential effect size ≥2( F i g .2c).In accordance with dietary substrate availability, six species had a higher relative abun-dance on the MBD and included dietary ﬁber degraders (Prevotella copri , uncharacterized Prevotella ,a n d Lachnospira pectinoschiza 27; Q=1 .4 6× 1 0−06, 0.0005, and 0.001, respectively) and/or butyrate pro- ducers [( Lachnospira pectinoschiza28,Eubacterium eligans29, and likely the uncharacterized Oscillibacter (CAG_241 and 57_20)30(Q = 1.46 ×10−06,0 .0 0 1 ,7 .4 4× 1 0−07, 0.01 and 2.27 ×10−07, respectively)].
In con- trast, the 4 species with a higher relative abundance on the WDincluded Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Bi ﬁdobacterium pseudocatenula- tum, uncharacterized Blautia CAG:257 , and uncharacterized Actino- myces ICM7 (Q = 0.006, 5.6 ×10 −05, 0.001, 0.02, respectively). These four species derive their source of fermentation from host-glycans,simple sugars 31,32, or fermentation products generated by other gut microbes, mainly CO 233and H 234.As a means of validation, we repeated this analysis with ANCOM-BC35–37, and retained the signi ﬁcance of most of the identi ﬁed species in the signature (Supplementary Data 2).The observed diet-induced changes in microbial composition were paralleled by an increase in fermentation, evidenced by higherSCFAs on the MBD vs.WD in feces (total, acetate, propionate, andbutyrate; P= 0.001, 0.002, 0.007, and 0.0005, respectively; Fig.3a)Fig.2 | Diet modulated the gut microbiome.

Although we previously showed that weight was stable withinindividuals during each domiciled calorimetry period when the dietswere consumed in random order 12, we uncovered a small, clinically insigni ﬁcant body weight reduction on both diets during the metabolic ward periods, and the loss was greater on the MBD than on the WD(−625.6 ± 196.5 g MBD; −134.4 ± 156.1 g WD; P=0 . 0 4 ; F i g .4a).This change in weight was accompanied by a trend towards greater loss off a tm a s so nt h eM B Dt h a no nt h eW D( −289.9 ± 97.30 g MBD; −64.7 ± 84.6 g WD; P= 0.06) without a change in lean mass (−365.9 ± 251.2 g MBD; −99.14 ± 201.7 g WD; P= 0.45; Fig.4b, c).This suggests that the additional fecal energy loss on the MBD was suf ﬁ- cient to promote a modest change in body composition despiteequivalent metabolizable energy intake based strictly on existing fooddigestibility paradigms.These paradigms do not account speci ﬁcally for the microbial biomass or microbial energy harvest 15.
One of the gaps in prior human studies was the lack of a precise quantitation of the entire energy b alance equation. In addition to our evaluation of energy intake (Supplementary Table 1, SupplementaryFig.3b) and fecal energy loss to derive host metabolizable energy(Fig.1a–c), we measured energy expenditure with whole room indirect calorimetry over 6 days and found no diet difference in sleep meta- bolic rate (in kcal/day) by diet ( P=0 .1 6 ;F i g .4d), despite being able to detect an a posteriori 26.5 kcal/day difference 12.This suggests that, under conditions of ﬁxed energy intake, the main quantitative con- tribution of the gut microbiome to host energy balance was through itseffect on energy harvested from the diet, particularly whensufﬁcient substrates were available for microbial fermentation, as with the MBD.
The relationships among diet c omposition, gut microbes, and colonic transit time (CTT) are complex, multi-directional, and varywithin individuals over time and between individuals 38.G i v e nt h e potential importance of CTT on the m icrobiota-driven host response to dietary manipulations, we evaluated whole-gut transit using a pH-sensing radiotransmitter device. This device has advantages to othermethods (such as the use of scinti graphy or radio-opaque markers) including that it is noninvasive, generates pH, temperature and pressuredata, provides whole gut and regional data, and importantly, the test isstandardized to improve reliability of interindividual and longitudinal assessments 39.In addition, the assessment was done under conditions of energy balance and with controlled diets that were customized tomeet exactly the needs of each participant.
This differs from otherapproaches that have evaluated gut microbiome-CTT interactions 40and is an important advancement given the critical role of diet compositionand quantity on both the gut microbiome and CTT. We did not ﬁnd a statistically signi ﬁcant difference in CTT by diet (29.7 ± 4.4 h on MBD vs.39.2 ± 6.2 h on WD; P=0 .1 4 ; F i g .4e).Gastric emptying evaluated by acetaminophen appeara nce in the blood after a ﬁxed liquid meal also was not different by diet (Supplementary Fig.6a).The pH of the coloncan be an indicator of microbial fermentation activity.Neither the median pH of the entire colon (which re ﬂe c t sb o t hf e r m e n t a t i o na n dt h e impact of food mixing in the colon) nor the median pH within a 1-hwindow of the ileocecal passage (which is impacted primarily bymicrobial fermentation products) 41differed by diet ( P= 0.11 and 0.23, respectively; Fig.4f; Supplementary Fig.6b).
The lack of statistically signiﬁcant effects was likely due to the substantial amount of inter- individual variability in CTT, gastric emptying and colonic pH inresponse to each diet, con ﬁrming the complex and individualized relationships between diet and each of these parameters, which may becritical to understanding the host-microbiota axis within individuals 38. We hypothesized that the MBD might decrease appetite relative to the WD via the inclusion of high- ﬁber foods and production of metabolites through gut microbial fermentation42.W ee v a l u a t e dt h i s via subjective appetite scores (visual analog scale) and ad libitum foodintake (secondary endpoints).This hypothesis was not substantiatedby our data (Supplementary Fig.6c –h).

The mammalian gut senses nutrients and microbial fermentation products and is part of the larger enteroendocrine system that plays akey role in maintenance of energy homeostasis 43.Cumulative negative energy balances can result in body weight reductions.However, the regulation of body energy stores involves neural circuits in the hind-brain and hypothalamus, proximal and distal gut hormone secretionsand adipose tissue neural and endocrine signals to the brain 44.W e explored several potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiomemight regulate body weight beyond the observed negative energy balance.
On the second-to-last day of each domiciled period, wemeasured fasting and postprandial levels of several circulating hor-mones known to regulate appetite at 18 timepoints over 12-h (sec- ondary endpoints). Consistent with the slight, but measurable decrease in body fat stores on the MBD, secretion of the adipose tissue hormone leptin had a signi ﬁcantly lower incremental area under the curve (iAUC) on the MBD ( P=2 .3 9 × 1 0 −5; Fig.5a).A reduction in cir- culating leptin is known to increase food intake45.

Furtherexperiments should pursue this hypothesis. Microbial contribution to human energy balance Given the robust response to our diet intervention by the gut micro-b i o m ea n dh o s t ,w es o u g h tt od e t e r m i n et h eq u a n t i t a t i v ec o n t r i b u -tions of the gut microbiome to energy balance versus the impactdriven solely by food digestibility 10.Host metabolizable energy on the WD showed little interindividual variability (94.1 –97.0%; Fig.1b) since most nutrients were absorbed in the small intestine and were inac- cessible to the gut microbiome.However, the range of host metabo- lizable energy in response to the MBD was much broader (84.2 –96.1%; Fig.1b).The range translates to 73 –390 non-metabolized kcals/day (vs.59–185 kcals/day on the WD), a clinically meaningful quantitative dif- ference that could tip the scale towards a greater negative energybalance.
This led us to postulate that the quantitatively important varia- bility in host energy balance could be associated with the repertoire ofgut microbes in the colon. To test this, we asked whether the variabilityin host metabolizable energy on the MBD could be related to a uniquemicrobial signature.To identify those microbial signatures, we derived regression coef ﬁcients describing each microbe ’s association with the independent variable of host metabolizable energy using MaAsLin2 ’s compound Poisson regression model 26.In total, host metabolizable energy was associated with the relative abundance of 16 species(Supplementary Fig.7a, b).Four of those species had Q < 0.05 andeffect size ≥2 and have been identi ﬁed as differentially abundant after weight loss (due to bariatric surgery 47or caloric restriction48)a n di n bile acid metabolism49, suggesting a potential role in weight regula- tion.
Our results were not reproducible with an alternative nonpara-metric method (Kendall ’s tau-b correlation 50; Supplementary Data 3) and should be considered hypothesis-generating. Future studies that are designed and powered to explore the microbial species that explain the variability in host ME on the MBD are needed to con ﬁrm these results.We next embarked on a series of mathematical modeling runs25to estimate the gut microbial contribution to host energy balance.Wepreviously reported that our in silico model estimates the dual impactof host digestion and microbial fermentation on macronutrient uptakein the small and large intestine and ultimately, on host metabolizableenergy.The model also estimates the amount of SCFAs absorbed bythe host due to microbial fermentation in the colon and the associatedbiomass 14.
We applied an updated version of this model25to predict the host metabolizable energy we measured in our study by inputting actual energy intake components and fecal energy in grams COD/day.Our previously published model used a ﬁxed CTT of 48 h, which is a reasonable population-level estimate for healthy adults 51.W i t ha ﬁxed CTT, the mean modeled host metabolizable energy for participants onthe MBD was 92.4 ± 0.001% and for WD was 95.2 ± 0.001% (Fig. 6a).This is similar to the mean host metabolizable energy we measured onthe MBD and the WD (89.5 ± 0.73% and 95.4 ± 0.21%, respectively;Fig.1b).However, the model was biased as evidenced by the linear distribution of the points which estimated essentially the same meta-bolizable energy for each person in contrast to the variability in themeasured metabolizable energy (Fig.6a) and Bland –Altman plot (Supplementary Fig.7c).
We hypothesized that we could reduce the model ’s bias by incorporating measured CTT since it is a key mod- ulator of microbial composition, fermentation, and host energybalance 38. Incorporating the measured CTT values reduced bias based on greater reproducibility (concordance correlation coef ﬁcient: 0.5148:30AM 9:30AM 10:30P M 11:30P M 12:30P M 1:30PM 2:30PM 3:30PM 4:30PM 5:30PM 6:30PM 7:30PM 8:30PM010000200003000040000 TimeLeptin (pg/mL)MBDWDrenniD hcnuL tsafkaerB P=2.39 x 10-5 8:30AM 9:30AM 10:30P M 11:30P M 12:30P M 1:30PM 2:30PM 3:30PM 4:30PM 5:30PM 6:30PM 7:30PM 8:30PM020406080 TimeGLP-1 total (pM)WD MBDBreakfast Lunch Dinner P=0.10 8:30AM 9:30AM 10:30P M 11:30P M 12:30P M 1:30PM 2:30PM 3:30PM 4:30PM 5:30PM 6:30PM 7:30PM 8:30PM0100200300400500600700 TimePancreatic polypeptide (mg/dL)WD MBDBreakfast Lunch Dinner P=6.09 x 10-5a b c Fig.5 | An adipose-pancreas-gut appetite-modulating axis in response to diet.

Furthermore, systematic and proportional biases were minimized, as shown by a Bland –Altman plot (Supplementary Fig. 7d).Collectively, these data suggest that CTT is an important factor for estimating host metabolizable energy.High- ﬁber diets should increase absorption of SCFAs due to colonic microbial fermentation of ﬁber and resistant starch52.O u r model predicted that more total energy (g COD) as SCFAs was absor-bed by the host on the MBD, compared to the WD (72.3 ± 3.2 gCOD/dayof microbially-derived SCFAs on the MBD vs.36.4 ± 1.02 gCOD/day onthe WD; P=7 .2 5× 1 0 −9;F i g .6c).When we adjusted the SCFA absorption for energy intake and calculated a percentage, we found a nearly 2-foldgreater absorption of energy as SCFAs on the MBD as compared to theWD ( P=2 .6 0× 1 0 −10;F i g .6d).Therefore, despite less total energy being absorbed by the host on the MBD, a larger proportion was derived from SCFAs.
Consistent with our experimental data, our modelstrongly supports a signi ﬁcant microbial contribution to host meta- bolizable energy and, therefore, the overall energy balance. The wide interindividual variability in host metabolizable energy in response to the MBD is likely related to a combination of host andmicrobial factors.We postulated that we would be able to identify keyparameters within our study sample that explain a portion of thisvariability.Thus, we undertook an exploratory, multi-step statisticalprocess to identify potential host and microbial determinants of hostmetabolizable energy using data from the MBD only.We did so with an aim to consider a limited number of factors given our sample size.Following consideration of 15 potential factors as described in Meth-ods, the ﬁnal step in this process was a multivariate selection proce- dure into which one host factor (CTT) and two microbial factors (fecalpropionate and biomass) were entered.
The selection procedure chosefecal propionate and biomass —both microbial factors —for the ﬁnal optimized model and revealed that these two variables jointly explain58% of the variance in host metabolizable energy. According to theﬁnal model, each standard deviation (SD) increment in 6-day fecal propionate (858.6 mg) was associated with a 2.1% lower host metabo-lizable energy (95% CI 0.95, 3.2), while each SD increase in biomass (0.49 log of 16S rRNA gene copy number) was associated with a 1.6% lower host metabolizable energy (95% CI 0.44, 2.7) (Fig.6e).Discussion Microbial communities in the gut have a profound impact on mam- malian host endocrinology, physiology, and energy balance, with mostcausal inferences historically restricted to preclinical animalmodels 5,7,8.
Prior human studies exploring the relationships among the gut microbiome, obesity and energy balance lacked the deep pheno-typing, precise methodologies, and rigorous controls that are instru-mental for drawing causal inferences with respect to human health. Our central ﬁnding was that a diet designed to feed and modulate the colonic gut microbiome, under conditions of ﬁxed energy intake and physical activity, led to reduced metabolizable energy to the host dueto increased fecal energy output consisting of undigested food, 16SrRNA gene copy number (a surrogate of fecal bacterial biomass), andmicrobial metabolites but not to changes in energy expenditure.Thus,the greater fecal energy loss on the MBD was not just due to undi-gested food, but also to an in increase in fermenting gut microbes andtheir metabolites.
Although higher energy harvest by microbes isbelieved to lead to more energy being absorbed by the host basedprimarily on preclinical models 8, our results show the opposite: host metabolizable energy was lower due to higher fecal energy loss on the MBD. The greater fecal energy loss translated to an additional 116 kcal/ day lost in feces when participants were fed the MBD as compared tothe WD.The clinical signi ﬁcance of this difference can be inferred from the reduction in food intake needed to maintain a weight-reducedstate with obesity pharmacotherapy which has been modeled to be approximately 200 kcal/day 53.In addition, the cumulative impact over time of a 116 kcal/day energy de ﬁcit is in alignment with the population-level impact of “small changes ”in energy balance to pro- mote weight loss54.The direction of change in energy absorbed from the diet by the host (lower on the MBD) was consistent in 16 out of 17 study partici-pants.
This means that the gut microbiome of most of our participantshad the capacity to utilize available dietary substrates as evidenced bychanges in relative abundance of species capable of utilizing thosesubstrates. This observation is contrary to the “extinction ”hypothesis proposed in mice 55and suggests that, with rigorously controlled dietary conditions that vary markedly in the amount of substratedelivered to the colon with a comparable kcal and total macronutrientproﬁle, healthy humans harbor microbiomes which are adaptable and/ or have suf ﬁcient functional redundancy to overcome certain extinc- tions that might be imposed by diet or other factors.The reduction in host metabolizable energy on the MBD relative to the WD was not accompanied by a change in energy expenditure oran increase in hunger or ad libitum energy intake.
However, the sig-niﬁcant diet-induced modulation of the gut microbiome was accom- panied by a modest change in weight/body composition and robustenteroendocrine signals from the adipose-pancreas-gut axis. Ourresults support the hypothesis that an intentional remodeling of thegut microbiome through provision of adequate dietary ﬁber, resistant starch, and a focus on whole, minimally processed foods resets the integrated sensing mechanisms known to affect food intake and body energy stores.One or more of these mechanisms or other unknownmechanisms might be responsible for the associations between adiverse human gut microbiome and lower body mass index in free-living humans 5.Future host-diet-gut microbiome research should delve into the complex and interrelated systems that control bodyweight.The quantitative contributions of gut microbes to host energy balance were addressed in two ways.
First, the microbial biomass wasmodeled to contribute to >25% of the total fecal energy on both diets.Second, fermentation increased as evidenced by increased fecal and serum SCFAs on the MBD as compared to the WD. Thus, host energy absorption shifted towards microbially produced SCFAs and awayfrom proximally digested and absorbed nutrients.While the quanti-tative contribution of microbially generated SCFAs as inputs to hostenergy balance was negated by the additional loss of microbial bio-mass in the feces, the uptake of more microbially produced SCFAs wasassociated with increased total GLP-1 and PP concentrations which maytrigger important energy homeostasis signaling cascades to promotesatiety and suppress hunger 56,57.We also found a taxonomic signature that was in alignment with the expected impacts of the substrates available to the gut microbes on the two diets.Many of the species detected at higher abundance on the MBD were ﬁber degraders and/or butyrate producers.
We posit that the higher relative abundance of microbes that produce SCFAscould modulate several components of the energy balance equation.For example, Lachnospira pectinoschiza ,Eubacterium eligans ,a n d likely the uncharacterized Oscillibacter a r eb u t y r a t ep r o d u c e r s 28–30. Butyrate plays important roles in host energy balance by stimulatingthe release of satiety hormones such as GLP-1 58and accelerating CTT59.In addition, acetate stimulates the release of satiety hormones60and acts as a satiety signal61.Host metabolizable energy was highly variable on the MBD.Given our tight control of energy intake and energy expenditure, this sug- gests that the microbial contribution to this variability was greater in some hosts than others.Indeed, with a proportionally equivalent inputof substrates for microbes, fecal energy losses varied over an ~5-foldrange.
Next steps should include investigating the mechanisms bywhich the microbial communities in the human colon modulate energyArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38778-x Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 9 balance and their interaction with host factors such as CTT, which will provide valuable quantitative data to drive personalized strategies tooptimize host-microbiota-diet interactions and prevent or treatobesity. Our in silico mathematical model, which accurately estimated host metabolizable energy measured in our study, allowed us to pre-dict the quantitative contribution of biomass to fecal energy harvestand the 2-fold greater uptake of microbial derived SCFAs on theMBD than on the WD.In addition, we found that microbial biomass andfecal propionate (a surrogate of colonic fermentation) explained overhalf of the variance in host metabolizable energy.
This further supportsour hypothesis that the gut microbiome is an important component ofdiet modulation of host energy balance. We believe that by optimizingCTT, biomass, and SCFA production through diet, among other factorsthat may be revealed in future studies, the highly adaptable gut microbiome can serve as a target for personalized medicine 62.Our results collectively indicate that when dietary substrates are less available to the gut microbes (as with the WD), the microbes are“starved ”of host diet-derived substrates.This is in agreement with the ﬁndings from Sonnenberg et al.13.The lower 16S rRNA gene copy number on the WD suggests a decrease in microbial biomass due inpart to lower fermentable substrate availability to the microbes fromthe diet.Lower fecal and serum SCFAs on the WD point to lowermicrobial fermentation, which is an indicator of reduced microbialenergy harvest 8.
In addition, the increased relative abundance of mucin degraders on the WD suggests that the microbiota was “starved ” of diet-derived substrates and turned to the host-derived energy sources such as mucin. Mouse models have shown that B.thetaiotao- micron , which normally degrades glycans from plant-based foods, consumes host-derived mucin when diet-derived glycans are notavailable in suf ﬁcient quantitites 63.Similarly, mucin-degrading bacteria are more abundant in humans on calorie restricted diets or sufferingfrom anorexia nervosa 64.Our study had several limitations that should be considered when interpreting our results.Although our data revealed key gut micro-biome contributions to human energy balance, we were unable todeconvolute the complex human host-diet-gut microbiome interac- tions and therefore, cannot establish whether the changes in energy balance we observed are causally attributable to the diet, the microbes,or some combination.
Future directions to address these gaps includeimplementing bioinformatic pipelines that allow for absolute quanti-ﬁcation of microbial species 65and the proportion of fecal energy contributed by the gut microbes ( vs. undigested food).Additional mechanistic experiments are needed in preclinical models and bior-eactors to establish the speci ﬁc physiological pathways driven by communities of microbes 66, identify systemic lipids, metabolites or proteins that mediate diet-host-microbe interactions, and understandhow microbes utilize dietary components 67.Given the small sample size of our precisely controlled study, selection bias may limit gen- eralizability to other populations.Future studies should con ﬁrm and expand our ﬁndings in larger study samples.Nonetheless, the rando- mized crossover design vastly reduces the likelihood of confounderbias and yields outstanding internal validity.
Larger studies couldenable subgroup analyses to inform whether effect sizes vary by sex orother participant characteristics. A key open question to advance this ﬁeld is whether and how obesity or caloric restriction impact diet-gut microbiome effects onhuman energy balance.Given the size and scope of the global obesityepidemic and its continued increase, new solutions are needed.Thescienti ﬁc community has recently reoriented itself towards population interventions that promote small changes in energy intake and expenditure as a means of preventing weight gain 54.T h i ss t u d y demonstrates the potential to enact the “small changes ”54principle through the consumption of whole foods to modulate the gut micro-biome.Such a simple principle could be a useful population-level tooltoﬁght the global obesity epidemic.
Future experiments should focus on the microbial or host mechanisms that underly the observed largeinter-individual variability in the response to delivery of greater dietarysubstrates to the gut microbes. These mechanisms can then be tar- geted with precision nutrition approaches.Methods The details of the design of this trial (NCT02939703) have been pre- viously reported12.We summarize key elements below and include details on elements not reported elsewhere.The full study protocol isprovided in Supplementary Data 4.Study participants The results presented are from a clinical trial conducted in compliancewith all applicable ethical and institutional research requirements.The study was approved by the AdventHealth Institutional Review board (Orlando, FL, USA).All participants provided informed consent.Remuneration was done in accordance with local norms and with theapproval of our Association for the Accreditation of Human ResearchProtection Programs, Inc.
(AAHRPP) Accredited IRB to ensure weprovided fair compensation without inducement. There were no majorchanges to the methods after the trial commenced.We made twominor changes: 1) clari ﬁed the depression exclusion to provide a clear timeline for diagnosis and severity parameters warranting exclusion; 2)added an anemia exclusionary criterion out of an abundance of cau-tion due to the multiple blood draws at the end each diet period.We recruited approximately equal numbers of males and females 18 –45 years of age with a BMI ≤30 kg/m 2who were weight stable, otherwise healthy, and had not used antibiotics for the 3 months prior toscreening between June of 2017 and August of 2019 12.The last parti- cipant visit occurred in October of 2019.Adverse events were mon-itored at each contact with the participant and reported according toInstitutional Review Board guidelines.
Design overview This was a randomized crossover study with a control Western Diet(WD) compared to a Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD) where each participant served as their own control, thereby minimizing the impact of confounders 68. We applied block randomization strati ﬁed by sex.The randomization code was generated by the study statistician whoworked directly with the study dietitian in charge of assigning menusto participants.Participants were enrolled by the study coordinator.Inorder to balance sex, we randomly assigned 3 blocks to each sex.Within each block ( n= 6), participants were randomly assigned using simple randomization to one of two diet sequences with a 1:1 allocationratio using SAS PROC PLAN.Eight participants were randomized tosequence 1 (WD followed by MBD) and 9 participants were randomizedto sequence 2 (MBD followed by WD).
After an initial assessment period to establish outpatient dietary intake requirements (Days 1 –9), all food was provided to participants, and they consumed the meals outpatient for 11 days (Days 10 –20 and 39–49) and inpatient for 12 days (Days 21 –32 and 50 –61). Included was a minimum 14-day washout between diet periods.During the 14-daywashout, participants returned home and were instructed to resumetheir usual diet and physical activity.The following additional restric-tions were implemented prior to each study period: avoidance ofalcohol during outpatient feeding periods, no caffeine up to 72 hbefore admission, no arti ﬁcial sweeteners, and no strenuous physical activity 48 h prior to admission.All endpoint assessments were con-ducted while participants were housed in our metabolic ward 12.
Armband accelerometry An armband accelerometer was placed to measure activity and esti-mate free-living energy expenditure (SenseWear Pro 3 Armband,BodyMedia Inc.) as well as free-living sleep duration, as previouslyArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38778-x Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 10 described12. These data were used to estimate outpatient calorie requirements.Clinical assessments Health status was determined by medical history, physical examina-tion, standard blood chemistries (AdventHealth Laboratory, Orlando,FL, USA), and the Bristol Stool Scale to evaluate stool type based onshape and consistency, with scores of 3-4 indicating neither con-stipation nor loose stools 17.
Whole-room indirect calorimetry Energy expenditure and all its subcomponents was evaluated every 24-hours with whole room calorimetry in two 6-day blocks per diet (days24–29 and 53 –58 12) following published standards of operation69.W e present the results of sleep metabolic rate (kcal/24-h) because it has the lowest interindividual variability. Activity was tightly controlled during the day to maintain spontaneous physical activity consistentwithin and between participants and to ensure consistent times ofmeals, exercise, type of activity, rest and sleep 12.Motion-free sleep was calculated from the radar motion detector in the calorimeter byremoving all minutes with ≥6 counts of movement.This is a surrogate of high-quality sleep that we use to minimize the effects of smallamounts of involuntary motion during sleep on sleep energyexpenditure 20.Supplementary Table 2 demonstrates the calorimetry schedule.
Energy balance Energy balance was estimated by subtracting estimated metabolizableenergy intake (calculated by menu design software based on actualfood intake) from energy expenditure measured by whole roomcalorimetry 70. Host metabolizable energy To calculate host metabolizable energy (primary endpoint), we con-verted energy intake in kcals to grams COD using our publishedmodel 24.That allowed us to compute the percent of energy metabo- lized by the host after accounting for fecal energy loss which was also measured in COD.To relate this percentage back to kcals and deter- mine the number of daily kcals that were not absorbed by the host, wemultiplied host metabolizable energy percentage by energy intakein kcals.Dietary intervention Our study diets were designed to maximize the differences of dietarysubstrate availability to gut microbes with the MBD while minimizing itwith the WD.
To achieve this, the MBD was higher in ﬁber and resistant starch, which are known substrates for microbial fermentation 13.W e also provided larger food particles (whole nuts vs. nut butter, for example) because ﬁne grinding of foods makes nutrients more bioa- vailable to the human host and thus, less available to the gutmicrobes 71,72.O n e ﬁnal element of our diets was minimizing processed foods on the MBD, in contrast to the known excess of processed foodsin the WD.Accumulating evidence indicates that processed foods, inaddition to lacking ﬁber and having smaller particle sizes, negatively impact host health in part via the gut microbiome 73.Details of the diet design, including sample menus can be found in our trial designpublication 12.Diets were prepared in our metabolic kitchen based on kcals needed to maintain energy balance as determined by whole-roomindirect calorimetry.
Diets were designed with menu software (Pro- Nutra Version 3.5, Viocare, Inc, Princeton, NJ) that proportionately calculated diets based on each participant ’se n e r g yn e e d s .D u p l i c a t e meals were prepared during all calorimetry days and evaluated forenergy content as a quality-control step (Euro ﬁns, Madison, WI). Nutritional composition of the diets was based on the menu softwaredatabase (USDA Database Standard ref.23), with the exception of resistant starch, because it is absent from all currently availablenutritional databases.We limited foods containing resistant starch onthe WD and then estimated the content on both diets based on pub- lished estimates of resistant starch content of common foods 74.D i e t s were equivalent in metabolizable energy and proportions of macro-nutrients.As much as possible, we used similar types of foods on bothdiets to minimize differences in micronutrients.
SupplementaryTable 1 shows the energy, macronutrient, and drivers in each diet.Consumption of 100% of provided foods was required. Diet adherencewas monitored during the 11-day outpatient phase at clinic visits 2 or 3times per week where at least one meal was consumed on site.Duringthe domiciled metabolic ward phases, all meals were monitored.Adherence was calculated by weighing back uneaten food (if any) andrecalculating dietary intake as a percentage of provided diet vs.unconsumed diet 12.Sample menus are available as supplementary material in our trial design publication12.Free-living dietary intake Outpatient dietary intake was evaluated using the validated food fre-quency questionnaire, the Diet History Questionnaire II (Diet HistoryQuestionnaire, Version 2.0.National Institutes of Health, Epidemiologyand Genomics Research Program, National Cancer Institute, 2010), onwhich patients self-reported the frequency and portion sizes of fooditems consumed over the past 12 months.
Diet Calc software was usedto estimate nutrients consumed based upon the United States Department of Agriculture food database (Diet*Calc Analysis Program, Version 1.5. National Cancer Institute, Applied Research Program).Sample collection, processing and shipment Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected in our metabolic unitusing standard protocols (Translational Research Institute, Orlando,FL, USA).Fecal samples were collected each time they were producedduring the 6-day measurement periods in the whole room calorimeter.Sample weights were tracked upon collection and as aliquots wereprepared.Fecal samples were processed within an hour of productionunder an anaerobic hood and were maintained on ice during proces- sing.After mixing with a sterile spatula, samples were sub-aliquoted for various downstream applications.Samples for metagenomic sequen-cing and SCFAs were snap frozen without additives and stored at−80 °C.They were shipped overnight on dry ice.
Any fecal sample not needed for method-speci ﬁc aliquots were stored (sealed) in the ori- ginal collection container at −20 °C within 60 min of collection. At the end of each 6-day calorimetry period, all collection containers wereopened, and all frozen samples were transferred into a single, large,homogenization container to create a composite sample (withoutadditives) that was used to measure fecal energy and biomass.Thecomposite was partially thawed on ice while remaining sealed and then homogenized, on ice, using a sterile paddle homogenizer.The com- posite sample was stored at −80 °C until used or shipped overnight on dry ice 12.Weight and body composition Weight (fasting and in a gown) was measured daily during the 12-daymetabolic ward stay on a calibrated scale.
Body composition wasassessed with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry the day prior toentering the calorimeter (Days 23 and 52) and after exiting thecalorimeter (Days 31 and 60) with a two-day window allowed for thepre or post measurement. Fecal energy Fecal energy was measured with chemical oxygen demand (COD) atthe AdventHealth Translational Research Institute (Orlando, FL, USA)as per our previous publication 24.B r i e ﬂy, COD was measured per manufacturer ’s protocol using a reactor digestion method with high-Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38778-x Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 11 range digestion vials followed by a colorimetric assay (HACH, Love- land, CO; Product # 2125925).To ensure that fecal energy was accu-rately re ﬂective of 24-hour fecal production, we utilized the non- absorbable, non-digestible fecal marker polyethylene glycol (PEG).Participants consumed 1.5 g/day (0.5 g/meal) of PEG of molecular weight 3350 g/mol (PEG3350).
The PEG3350 was procured by a com-pounding pharmacy that prepared 0.5 g capsules (percent error = 2.8%) (Pharmacy Specialists, Altamonte Springs, FL). The details of the PEG assay are below.Fecal energy was measured in 6-day compositesof feces collected in our calorimeters.We normalized fecal energyproduced to the weight of all feces produced in those 6-days and thento PEG recovery.Fecal energy loss was converted to host metaboliz-able energy by calculating the percentage of energy that was lost infeces (in g COD) relative to total energy intake (in g COD).The con-version from energy in COD to kcals lost in feces per day (non-meta- bolizable kcals) was calculated by multiplying total EI in kcals by the percent host metabolizable energy.
Polyethylene glycol assay We utilized a method that is slightly modi ﬁed from the initial published method by Sadilek et al.75.K e ym o d i ﬁcations include quantitation based on the +2 charged PEG3350 polymers instead of the +4 chargedpolymers and the inclusion of an internal standard. Sample prepara-tion was also slightly modi ﬁed.Brie ﬂy, samples were prepared by a 1:1 dilution with Nanopure water and homogenized.Two grams of samplewas diluted in 14 ml Nanopure water that included a ﬁnal concentra- tion of 1.5 uM internal standard (monodispersed PEG, MW 2160 g/mol; Quanta Biodesign, Plain City, OH; Product # 10897).An HPLC-MSmethod was used for the separation and detection of PEG3350 inhuman fecal samples 75.T h em o d ﬁed assay was transferred to ARL Biopharma for subsequent PEG quanti ﬁcation on study samples (Oklahoma City, OK).The assay is linear as evidenced by the R2of the calibration curve (0.9987).
The linear range of the assay was from0.1 uM to 20 uM with PEG3350 recovery ranging from 96.2 to 104.5%.The relative standard deviation of the assay was 1.8%. There was no co-elution of analyte with expected excipients or related compounds inchromatograms demonstrating the assay is speci ﬁc for PEG3350.Quanti ﬁcation of bacterial 16S rRNA genes Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed (Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA) with triplicate PCR reactions as previouslydescribed 76in a Thermo ﬁsher Applied Biosystems Quant Studio 3.Universal primers 926F (5 ′–AAACTCAAAKGAATTGACGG −3′)a n d 1062R (5 ′- CTCACRRCACGAGCTGAC −3′) were used.Calibration curves using 7 data points were generated on each run using plasmidswith 16S rRNA genes, and adding a plasmid concentration to achievecopy numbers in the range from 10 1to 109per reaction.
Reaction mixtures with a ﬁnal volume of 20 µL, comprised of 10 µL 2× Fast-Start SYBR green, 0.6 µL each forward and reverse primer ( ﬁnal concentra- tion, 0.3 µM), 2 µL DNA template (equilibrated to 10 ng), and deionized H2Ot o2 0 µL. Themocycler conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 61.5 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, and aﬁnal elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min.Standards were made by cloning the E.coli 16S rRNA gene using the ThermoFisher TOPO TA Cloning Kit.Plasmids were puri ﬁed using the Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit.Puri ﬁed plasmids were quanti ﬁed by Qubit.
Plasmid copy number was then calculated using the following formula: Copy Number = DNAng μL/C16/C17 hi *6:022*1023 Plasmid length bp ðÞ*109*660ð1Þ 16S rRNA gene copy numbers per gram of feces were used to calculate daily copy numbers by multiplying by fecal weight and adjusting to PEG recovery.DNA sequencing Fecal sample processing, nucleic acid extraction, library preparation,and whole genome shotgun sequencing were performed at the Uni-versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Microbiome Core (Chapel Hill, NC, USA), which is supported by the following grants: Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease (CGIBD P30 DK034987) and the UNC NutritionObesity Research Center (NORC P30 DK056350). DNA was extractedusing the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit and library was preparedusing the Swift 2S Turbo DNA library kit.DNA was sequenced on theIllumina HiSeq 4000 PE 150 platform.Positive controls includedZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard (Cat.No.D6300),Microbial Community DNA standard (Cat.No.
D6305), and GutMicrobiome Standard (Cat. No.D6331).DNA-free deionized water wasused as a negative control and to detect possible contamination.Toavoid batch effects, fecal samples were randomized prior to nucleic acid extraction and all samples were sequenced at the same time.Mean total reads were 18,339,758, with similar read depth on each diet(19,475,004 for the WD and 17,204,513 for the MBD).DNA sequence processing DNA sequencing output was quality controlled with FastQC (Version0.12.0) 77.Adapters were trimmed using TrimGalore (Version 0.6.5)78.DNA sequences were aligned to Hg38 (GRCh38.p14) using bowtie2(Version 2.4.5) 79.Sequences were ﬁltered in the alignment step of sequence processing.Reads were paired.Count data was used as inputinto software packages for analysis.Software packages then used total sum scaling (TSS) to calculate relative abundance.DNA sequences were then analyzed for taxonomic composition with MetaPhlAn3(Version 3.0.14) 80, using standard parameters.
Species alpha- and beta-diversity All calculations and analyses were conducted in R (Version 4.2.2)81. Taxonomic composition output from MetaPhlAn3 (Version 3.0.14) wasprocessed for beta-diversity analysis using the “phyloseq ”Rp a c k a g e (Version 1.42.0) 82.A rarefaction curve was created using the “vegan ”R package (Version 2.6-40)83to determine the optimal count-depth for rarefaction.Once the optimal count-depth was determined, rarefac- tion was performed using phyloseq (Version 1.42.0).Alpha-diversity metrics were calculated using the “microbiome ”Rp a c k a g e( V e r s i o n 1.20.0)84.A f t e rs a m p l e sw e r er a r i ﬁed, each sample had 3,578,445 sequences.Bray –Curtis and Jaccard distance matrices were calculated on the rare ﬁed count data using vegan (Version 2.6-40).The distance matrices were tested for signi ﬁcance by PERMANOVA using vegan (Version 2.6-40).Diet was the only signi ﬁcant term for both metrics (Bray –Curtis: P= 0.017, Jaccard: P= 0.016).
Beta-dispersion was calculated, and the results tested for signi ﬁc a n c ew i t ht h eA N O V A - like permutation test and Tukey ’s HSD in vegan (Version 2.6-40). Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) ordination was performed with vegan (Version 2.6-40).CAP is a multivariate linear method85that we used to assess how much of the variation in the beta- diversity could be explained by diet.Consistent with the linear mixedmodel approach used for analyzing the clinical data, diet, sequence,a n dp e r i o dw e r e ﬁxed, and participant was a random factor.Statistical signiﬁcance testing was performed with PERMANOVA in base R.Beta- diversity ordination ﬁgures were created using the “ggplot2 ”Rp a c k - age (Version 3.4.1) 86.Differential abundance heatmap ﬁgures were created using the “ComplexHeatmap ”R package (Version 2.14.0)87.
Differential abundance Differential abundance testing by diet and associations of species relative abundance with host metabolizable energy were carried out using the output of MetaPhlAn3 in the “MaAsLin2 ”Rp a c k a g e( V e r s i o n 1.12.0)26. Taxonomic counts were ﬁltered with a 25% prevalence cut-off.Compound Poisson multivariate linear models were used to accountfor zero-in ﬂated data 26.For differential abundance testing, diet,Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38778-x Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 12 sequence, and period were ﬁxed, with participant as the random fac- tor.For analyzing associations of species relative abundance with hostmetabolizable energy, metabolizable energy was the ﬁxed indepen- dent factor, because the analysis was restricted to samples in the MBD only.For rigor and reproducibility, we repeated the differential abun- dance analyses with a different method using the same parameters asthe original analyses.
We validated our results related to differentialabundance by diet with ANCOM-BC, an approach often used to evaluatedifferential abundance that has been found to produce results thatfrequently overlap with other approaches 37. For validating correlations between relative abundance and m etabolizable energy on the MBD only, we employed Kendall ’s tau-b correlation coef ﬁcient50because it is a non-parametric test that is often used to explore the relationshipbetween relative abundance and continuous or ordinal variables 88.Short-chain fatty acids A targeted SCFA panel including acetate, propionate and butyrate wasconducted for both fecal and serum SCFA (Metabolon, Inc., Moores-ville, NC).For fecal SCFAs, the concentrations were adjusted for totalfeces produced and PEG recovery to calculate the total fecal SCFAsover the 6 inpatient calorimetry days.Acetate, butyrate, and propio-nate were summed to calculate total fecal SCFA and total serum SCFA.
Appetite Subjective ratings of appetite (secondary endpoint) were determined using visual analog scales (VAS) administered at −30,−1 5 ,+ 3 0 ,+ 6 0 , +120, and +180 min pre/post each meal. Breakfast was ﬁxed at 500 kcals and lunch and dinner provided 1.5 X the energy content ofeach participant ’s energy balanced diet consumed while in the whole room calorimeter, which is equivalent to 1.3X the energy needed infree-living conditions on our metabolic ward.Ad libitum intake (sec-ondary endpoint) was allowed at lunch and dinner for assessment ofchanges in food intake 12.The trapezoidal rule was used to calculate the iAUC per meal and diet for each appetite scale89.Gut transit time A radiotransmitter motility capsule was used to determine transit timeand pH in the colon (SmartPill ™; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) 12,90.T h e SmartPill ™was administered while participants were in the whole- room calorimeter under a standardized protocol.It was consumedimmediately after breakfast.
Gastric emptying Gastric emptying was assessed via acetaminophen appearance inserum after a test meal. Acetaminophen (1,500 mg) was administeredat nominal timepoint zero 12.The measurement assay was performed at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (Baton Rouge, LA, USA).Enteroendocrine hormones Enteroendocrine hormones (secondary endpoint) in plasma wereevaluated after a test meal (Boost Plus or equivalent, 500 kcal) andlunch/dinner from their assigned diet at nominal timepoints −30,−15, + 30, +60, + 120, and +180 min pre/post each meal 12(Translational Research Institute; Orlando, FL, USA).GLP-1 (active), Leptin, and Pan-creatic Polypeptide were measured with V-PLEX Metabolic Panel 1Human Kit (MesoScale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD; Product #K15325D).For enteroendocrine hormones, the iAUC for the total timeof measurement (~11 h) was calculated by diet.The trapezoidal rule wasused to calculate the iAUC 91.
Mathematical modeling Previously, we developed an in silico multicompartment transit, reac-tion, and absorption model with these 3 compartments: uppergastrointestinal tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, and the remaining human body 14. The model estimates human dietary absorption for the general population and humans who had sections of small intestinesand large intestines surgically removed.Speci ﬁcally, the model calcu- lates the host absorption of carbohydrates, protein, and fat in the upper gastrointestinal tract and microbe-derived SCFAs in the lowergastrointestinal tract 14.For each participant, we had daily and cumu- lative values for grams of carbohydrates, proteins, fat, total ﬁber, and resistant starch consumed based on our designed menus.
To use thisinformation in our mathematical model, we systematically convertedthe measurements into gCOD/day of a) Available Sugar and Starch;CHO (g) - Resistant Starch (g) –ﬁbers (g), b) Resistant Starch (RS), c) Non-Starch Polysaccharides (NSP), d) Proteins, and e) Fat. These datawere input into the model to estimate host metabolizable energy andcompare it to our measured data.We then improved the model by using the measured CTT and evaluated the impact of this change by comparing actual versus modeled data.The performance of the modelfor estimating host metabolizable energy was evaluated by analyzingconcordance correlation coef ﬁcient components: bias correction fac- tor (Cb)- accuracy; Pearson ’s correlation coef ﬁcient (r) between mea- sured and modeled metabolizable energy- precision; concordancecoefﬁcient correlation ( ρc)- precision 92.
We evaluated systematic and proportional bias with a Bland –Altman plot93.W ec o m p a r e dt h e absolute and proportional SCFA absorption with a paired two-tailed t-test. The model code with revisions speci ﬁc to this manuscript can be found here: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/634925145 25.Statistics and reproducibility Details of the sample size determination have been previously published12.B r i e ﬂy, our prior modeling experiments predicted a dif- ference of 110 kcal of fecal energy loss (COD g/day) on the MBD vs.WDfor a person consuming 2000 kcal/day.Our power analysis was basedon prior data on repeated measures of 24-h and sleeping energyexpenditure 94and prior COD measurements where replicate variability was known.Our sample size was adequate to detect a 120 kcal/daydifference in energy expenditure and an 80 kcal/day difference in fecalCOD.
This small sample size was made possible by the repeated mea- sures, precision of our measurements, crossover design, and tight control of diet and environment. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean if normally distributed or as median(interquartile range) if non-normally distributed; categorical variablesare shown as counts and percentages.Appropriate to our randomized crossover design, we used a linear mixed model (SAS PROC MIXED) with diet, period, and sequence asﬁxed effects and participant as a random effect to compare differences by diet in our primary endpoint (host metabolizable energy: fecalenergy loss adjusted to energy intake) and most other secondary and exploratory endpoints.When the distribution of the model residuals was found to deviate considerably from normality, a logarithmictransformation was applied.
For each endpoint, we included onlyparticipants with complete data for both diet interventions when thedata were considered to be missing not at random. Otherwise, no datawere excluded from the analyses.Three values that were considered tobe missing at random for the enteroendocrine hormone data (one outof 18 serial timepoints over the day was missing for each of threeparticipants due to temporary issues with blood draw or laboratoryanalysis, but not because the entire sample was missing) were imputedusing the interpolation method (i.e., averaging the previous and sub-sequent values) 95.
We imputed the last (+180) timepoint of 6 serial timepoints for one participant for the gastric emptying assay using the last observation carried forward approach, given the relative stabilityof the +120 min and +180 min timepoints (median difference 0.55 ng/mL; IQR −0.55, 1.55) 95.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38778-x Nature Communications | (2023) 14:3161 13 To identify host and microbial determinants of host metaboliz- able energy, we ﬁrst constructed a correlation matrix with hypothesis-driven host and microbial factors that might in ﬂuence the efﬁciency of dietary energy harvest. We evaluated a total of 15 factors in the following domains: biomass, gut transit time (small intestinal and colonic), ileocecal passage pH, SCFAs (circulating and fecalacetate, propionate, butyrate, total, and acetate to propionate ratio),and total GLP-1.
We elected not to include relative microbial abun-dance data given the inability of a general linear model to appro-priately handle zero-in ﬂated data. We eliminated independent variables that were highly correlated to each other and selected onlyvariables with reasonable correlations with host metabolizableenergy ( Pvalue < 0.2 for Pearson or Spearman correlation coef ﬁ- cients) for inclusion in a general linear regression variable selectionprocedure.For variables from same “family ”(e.g., SCFA and micro- bial species), we selected the variable most highly correlated with host ME.Relevant to our results, fecal acetate and butyratewere highly intercorrelated with propionate.Since propionatehad the strongest correlation with host metabolizable energy, itwas selected as the representative SCFA.For variables not from thesame family (e.g., colonic transit, SCFA), we retained variablesunless correlations prohibitively high (i.e., Pearson or Spearman ’s rho≥0.75).
Based on these criteria, from our original list of 15 variables, three variables (CTT, fecal propionate, and biomass) wereincluded in a stepwise linear regression selection procedure(PROC GLMSELECT in SAS). The selection procedure primarily used Pvalues to determine which variables should be included or excluded from stepwise models, and the model with thelowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 96was chosen as the ﬁnal model.Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and R 4.2.2.A Pvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.When using the false discovery rate (FDR)97to correct for multiple compar- isons for differential abundance analysis of gut microbial compositionand associations of gut microbes with host metabolizable energy, anFDR Qvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Since inadvertent visualization of the diets could unblind investigators, the study could not be conducted in a blinded manner.
However, the treatment assignment was not revealed to investigators and all datawere collected and maintained blinded to treatment assignment untilthe database was locked upon study enrollment completion and sta-tistical analyses were completed.
