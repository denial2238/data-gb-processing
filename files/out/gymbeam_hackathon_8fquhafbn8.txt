Context: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent in 25–30% of British and European populations, representing a potential global public health crisis. Marine omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids offer well-evidenced benefits to NAFLD biomarkers; however, the effect of plant-based n-3 has not been evaluatedwith a systematic review and meta-analysis.Objective: The review aimed to sys- tematically evaluate the effect of plant-based n-3 supplementation on NAFLD surro- gate biomarkers and parameters.Data Sources: Medline (EBSCO), PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials published between January 1970 and March2022 evaluating the impact of plant-based n-3 interventions on diagnosed NAFLD.The review followed the PRISMA checklist and is PROSPERO registered (CRD42021251980).
Data Extraction: A random-effects model and generic inverse variance methods synthesized quantitative data, followed by a leave-one-outmethod for sensitivity analysis. We identified 986 articles; after the application of selection criteria, six studies remained with 362 patients with NAFLD.Results: The meta-analysis showed that plant-based n-3 fatty acid supplementation significantlyreduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (mean difference: 8.04 IU/L; 95% confi- dence interval: 14.70, 1.38; I 2¼48.61%) and plasma/serum triglycerides (44.51 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval: –76.93, –12.08; I2¼69.93%), alongside body-composition markers in patients with NAFLD (P <0.05).Conclusion: Plant- based n-3 fatty acid supplementation improves ALT enzyme biomarkers, triglycer- ides, body mass index, waist circumference, and weight loss when combined withlifestyle interventions to increase physical activity and a calorie-controlled diet.VCThe Author(s) 2023.

INTRODUCTION Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an impor- tant noncommunicable disease (NCD) that poses amajor challenge to public health. 1,2The global preva- lence of NAFLD is approximately 25% in the worldpopulation, although there is wide geographical varia- tion, and reaching 30% in Middle Eastern and South American countries.2,3The disease is recognized as a spectrum of conditions, ranging from ectopic fat accu-mulation in the liver 4or simple steatosis (accumulation of lipid droplets within >5% of hepatocytes)5to nonal- coholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and ultimately cirrho- sis.6The estimated prevalence of NAFLD is 25–30% in British and European populations, with younger gener-ations increasingly affected.5,7 With increasingly high prevalence in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, obesity is one of themain contributary factors for NAFLD.
The latest statis-tics for England published in 2020 show that approxi-mately two-thirds of adults are above a healthy weight and half are living with obesity, 8of whom 90% will have some degree of NAFLD.2,9Furthermore, obesity accounted for over 1 000 000 UK hospital admissions in2019/2020, resulting in annual National Health Servicecosts in excess of £6 billion. 8,10The European Health Interview Survey shows a similar pattern, with 53% of adults over 18 years living with overweight or obesity inEurope 11and over 4 million people died globally in 2017 due to being overweight or obese.12Lifestyle changes, usually aimed at weight loss, are a primary aim of recommended therapeutic strategies, while drug approaches have generally yielded disappointing resultsso far regarding liver histology outcomes.
13 Omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids offer well-evidenced ben- efits to NAFLD biomarkers,14and diets low in n-3 have been identified as a risk factor for NAFLD mortalityusing the Global Burden of Disease 2019 data. 15,16 Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that regular marine-based n-3 consumptionpredominantly in the form of fish or krill oils throughdiet and/or supplementation offers significant(P<0.05) benefits to liver fat, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), c-glutamyl transferase (GGT), steatosis score, plasma/serumtriglycerides (TGs), insulin resistance, and glycemic control biomarkers.17–22These marine-based n-3 fatty acids (predominantly consisting of long-chain n-3 eico- sapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) can contain relatively high concentrations ofmarine pollutants and pose sustainability issues.Fish oilis thought to be the main vector carrying marine pollu-tants to human consumers.
23Exposure to heavy metals in adolescence is thought to lead to alterations in energyhomeostasis and excessive adiposity in later life. 24In terms of sustainability, there is increasing demand for highly purified EPA and DHA for the preparation ofethyl ester–based pharmaceutical products, whichincurs production losses of 90–95%.25In addition, cli- mate change has resulted in the decline of marinemicroalgae from which oily fish species obtain theirEPA and DHA, with a reduction in DHA content for oily fish of 58% predicted by 2100.26 Marine sources of n-3 by their nature are unsuit- able for vegetarians and vegans, and public healthorganizations are increasingly recommending a plant-based dietary approach for health and sustainability.27,28 Plant-based n-3 sources have been shown to improve markers of NAFLD-related comorbidities, includingcardiovascular disease (CVD) and the metabolic syn-drome.
29–31Commercial applications have recently successfully developed direct sources of EPA- andDHA-rich oil from microalgal sources, which provide aplant-based bioequivalent source of n-3 to those found in marine sources. 32Algal sources of EPA and DHA are freely available food-based supplements, widely recom-mended as a suitable supplement for non–fish eat-ers, 25,33with safe, tolerable, nonclinical dosages of up to 3 g/day of EPA/DHA.34–36Walnut, flax, chia, canola, hemp, echium, and perilla seed oils are all good plant-based sources of n-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and offer various health benefits.These include improve- ments in insulin sensitivity, inflammation, hepatic stea-tosis, and CVD risk factors, although the health benefitsof ALA are not as well established as those attributed toEPA and DHA.
34Although the benefits of marine n-3 consumption on NAFLD are well established, the effectsof plant-based n-3 fatty acids are yet to be examined ina systematic review and meta-analysis. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to 144 Nutrition ReviewsVRVol.82(2):143–165 evaluate the potential benefits of plant-based n-3 sup- plementation on NAFLD surrogate biomarkers and parameters.METHODS The current systematic review and meta-analyses fol- lows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines37and additional nutrition-based systematic review and meta- analysis guidance38and is registered in the International Prospective Register of SystematicReviews (PROSPERO CRD42021251980).39 Search strategy The searches for data and articles for inclusion in this systematic review with meta-analysis were carried out until March 2022.
Relevant trials were identifiedthrough systematic searches of Medline (EBSCO),CINAHL (EBSCO), PubMed, and Google Scholar data- bases along with Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the International Clinical TrialsRegistry Platform to identify randomized controlled tri- als (RCTs) published between January 1970 and March 2022.
The search used the following keywords: “Flax*oil” OR “Linseed oil” OR “Chia seed oil” OR “Rapeseed oil” OR “Echium seed oil” OR “Hemp seed oil” OR “Perilla seed oil” OR “Alga* oil” in the article title orabstract OR “Omega*3” OR “Alpha-linolenic acid” OR “Stearidonic acid” OR “Eicosapentaenoic acid” OR “Docosahexaenoic acid” in the title or abstract AND“liver” (MeSH) OR “hepat*” OR “steat*” OR “fibrosis”OR “cirrhosis” OR “fatty liver” OR “nonalcoholic” OR “Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease” OR “NAFLD” OR Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease” OR “Non-alcoholicfatty liver” OR “Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis” OR “NASH” OR “non-alcoholic steatohepatitis” in the title, abstract, or key words. The full search strategy can befound in Supplementary Material S1 ( please see the Supporting Information online ).To further minimize the effects of publication bias, a snowball method, characterized by manual checking of references from retrieved articles, was applied to ensure complete collection.
Identified studies weredirectly exported into Endnote (version X9; Thomson Reuters) bibliography software for criterion application, whereby a reference lists of eligible studies and reviewarticles were screened for eligibility.
Publication alertswere set to identify any studies published after the date of the literature search.Study selection criteria Randomized controlled trials evaluating dietary inter- ventions of at least 2 weeks’ duration were included.Studies were excluded on the basis that 1 or more of thefollowing criteria applied: (1) RCTs that only evaluatedmarine oil n-3 fatty acid sources, (2) RCTs that did notutilize an n-3 fatty acid–rich plant-based source, (3)studies that did not provide data on the levels of theoutcomes of interest at baseline and/or at the end oftrial, (4) studies that did not indicate the specific n-3fatty acid or dosage, (5) nonhuman studies, (6) observa-tional studies, (7) cross-sectional studies, (8) casereports, (9) studies not published in the English lan-guage, and (10) studies without full access to publishedfindings. Please see the Participant, Interventions,Comparisons, Outcomes and Study Design (PICOS)criteria in Table 1 .Participants.
Inclusion criteria: Adult, adolescent, and infant popula- tions diagnosed with NAFLD or NASH using any rec-ognized diagnostic criteria. Exclusion criteria: Participants diagnosed with a serious unrelated pathology other than NAFLD/NASH,metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, overweight, andobesity (such as cancer, kidney disease, cystic fibrosis,myocardial infarction, organ transplant) and participantswith altered endocrinological state (such as pregnancy,lactation, endometriosis, or polycystic ovary syndrome).Intervention: Plant-based n-3 supplementation using good sources of n-3 fatty acids (with “good”defined as typically >23% of total fatty acids).34,40,41 Comparator: Placebo or nonintervention control (treatment as usual/standard-care group, lifestyle modi-fication to lose 7–10% of total body weight by diet andexercise is the first-line standard-care treatment forNAFLD).5Marine and other oils as a comparator to plant-based n-3 fatty acids.Studies using animals wereexcluded.
Single-arm intervention studies without acontrol group were excluded. Primary outcome: A comparison of the effects of plant-based n-3 fatty acid supplementation on recog-nized NAFLD-related surrogate biomarkers, includingliver enzyme biomarkers (ALT, AST, and GGT).Lipidprofiles (total cholesterol [TC], high-density-lipoprotein[HDL] cholesterol, and low-density-lipoprotein [LDL]cholesterol), plasma/serum TGs, inflammatory markers(high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [Hs-CRP]), andeffects on glycemic-control biomarkers (blood glucose,insulin, homeostatic model of insulin resistance[HOMA-IR]) were also evaluated along with body-composition markers (body mass index [BMI], waistcircumference [WC], and weight loss).17–22 Nutrition ReviewsVRVol.82(2):143–165 145 Data extraction Screening was conducted with 2 independent research- ers (E.M.and K.E.L.) in duplicate.Differences in opin- ion were resolved by group consultation (E.M., K.E.L., I.G.D., and I.P.) until consensus was reached.
Extracted data included author, study year, country, study design, intervention source/dose, number of participants and intervention allocation, participant health status, inter- vention time frame, and main findings. Data were cap- tured for baseline, endpoint, and changes in surrogate biomarkers measured in routine NAFLD patient care and monitoring.42Biomarkers included ALT, AST, GGT, TC, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, TGs, Hs- CRP, blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR alongside BMI, and WC, all of which can be elevated in patients with NAFLD,14,43and weight loss, the most effective treat- ment for NAFLD.42The SI units were included for each outcome measure.Risk-of-bias assessment Risk of bias of RCTs was evaluated independently by 2 investigators (E.M.and K.E.L.).The assessment wasperformed at the study level with the revised Cochranerisk-of-bias tool, which grades the risk of selection, per- formance, attrition, detection, and reporting biases.
44 This tool assesses whether a study has a low risk of bias, some concerns, or a high risk of bias. Differences inopinion were resolved by group consultation (E.M.,K.E.L., and I.G.D.) until consensus was reached.Statistical analysis All data were collected as means 6SDs.
The SD of the unreported mean difference (MD) of the change wascalculated by the following formula: SD 2¼[(SD baseline2 þSDfinal2)/C0(2/C2R/C2SDbaseline/C2SDfinal)],45correla- tion coefficients ( R) were computed for each outcomeTable 1 PICOS criteria Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria •Population •Adults diagnosed with NAFLD •Adolescents diagnosed with NAFLD •Children diagnosed with NAFLD •Participants with NAFLD-related pathology (MetS, type 2 diabe- tes, overweight, and obesity)•Population •Diagnosed with a serious unrelated pathology other than NAFLD/NASH, MetS, type 2 diabetes, overweight, and obesity (such as cancer, kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, myocardial infarc- tion, organ transplant) •Altered endocrinological state (such as pregnancy, lactation,endometriosis, or polycystic ovary syndrome) •Intervention •Plant-based n-3 supplementation •Lifestyle intervention•Intervention •Marine-based n-3 supplementation without a plant-based arm •Comparisons •Placebo or nonintervention control (treatment as usual/stand-ard-care group, lifestyle modification to lose 7–10% of total body weight by diet and exercise is the first-line standard-care treatment for NAFLD5) •Marine and other oils as a comparator to plant-based n-3 fatty acids•Comparisons •Studies using animals •Single-arm intervention studies without a control group •Outcomes •Compares effect of plant-based n-3 fatty acid supplementation NAFLD surrogate biomarkers including ALT, AST, and GGT •Lipid profiles (TC, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol), plasma/ serum TGs •Inflammatory markers (Hs-CRP); effect on glycemic-control bio-markers (blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR) •Body-composition markers (BMI, WC, weight loss)Outcomes •Study design •Randomized controlled trials evaluating plant-based n-3 inter- ventions of at least 2 weeks’ duration•Study design •Studies that did not indicate the specific n-3 fatty acid ordosage •Observation studies •Cross-sectional studies •Case reports •Other •Full paper •English language•Other •Protocol papers •Abstract only Abbreviations : ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; GGT, c-glutamyl transferase; HDL, high density lipoprotein; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model of insulin resistance; Hs-CRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; LDL,low density lipoprotein; MetS, metabolic syndrome; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;PICOS, Participant, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes and Study Design; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; WC, waistcircumference.

A full summary table of study design and findings are presented in Table 2 , 46,47,51–56including author, study year, country, study design, intervention source/ dose, number of participants and intervention alloca- tion, participant health status, intervention time frame,and main findings. All included studies incorporated hypocaloric diets and/or lifestyle interventions aiming to increase physical activity for participants in both theintervention and control/placebo groups.Adult study characteristics A total of 3 included studies recruited adult patients with NAFLD and were carried out in Iran.46,47,51,52All of these were RCTs, one of which was double-blinded,51 another was open-label,47,52and the third was not dis- closed.46With regard to intervention, Yari et al46intro- duced ground whole flaxseed powder (WF; 30 g/d; 6.9 g/d ALA, 112.5 mg lignans),57hesperidin (HS; 1 g/d) and flaxseed and hesperidin combined (HWF; 30 g/d;6.9 g/d ALA) hesperidin; 1 g/d, 112.5 mg lignans).
57 Similarly, Yari et al47introduced a brown milled flax- seed (WF) intervention (30 g/d; 6.9 g/d ALA, 112.5 mglignans). 57Rezaei et al51intervened with flaxseed oil (20 g/d; 9.96 g/d ALA), alongside the active control, sunflower oil (20 g/d).All patients consumed a hypo-caloric diet and were recommended to perform 30 to 40 minutes of moderate physical activity per day.The mean dosage of ALA for the adult studies was 7.665 g/dand all interventions ran for a period of 12 weeks.46,47,51,52 Child and adolescent studies The remaining 3 studies recruited children and adoles- cent patients with NAFLD and were completed in Italy and used algal oil containing 39% DHA.53–56The Pacifico et al53study intervened with algal oil dosages of 250 mg/d DHA; Nobili et al54,55used study arms with dosages of 250 mg/d DHA and 500 mg/d DHA, whereas Della Corte et al56included 500 mg/d DHA from algal oil and 800 IU vitamin D.
A total of 2 studies introduced placebo wheat germ oil (290 mg/d; omega-6 [n-6] linolenic acid),53–55as an active control; and 1 study included a hypocaloric diet and lifestylemodifications with no other intervention.56Algal oil intervention durations ranged from 24 weeks53,56to 24 months.54,55 Risk-of-bias assessment Details of the quality assessment can be found in Table 346,47,51–56andFigures 2 and3.46,47,51–56The child/ adolescent algal oil studies by Nobili et al54and the adult flaxseed study Pacifico et al53showed an overall low risk of bias. The remaining RCTs46,47,51,52,56showed some concerns in at least 1 domain, including randomization process and measurement of outcome, but were not deemed to be at high risk for any domain.44 META-ANALYSIS Effects on liver enzyme parameters Alanine aminotransferase.

59This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of plant-based n-3fatty acid supplementation and did not make direct com-parisons to marine-based n-3 studies.Liver enzymes The meta-analysis showed a significant ( P¼0.01) pooled reduction of ALT with plant-based n-3; how- ever, there was no effect on AST or GGT. This suggests that plant-based n-3 does not offer improvements to AST and GGT; however, it should be noted that 2 of thechild/adolescent studies 53–55did not measure AST and GGT, so the meta-analysis predominantly represents the adult ALA studies for these biomarkers.The adultflaxseed studies had a relatively short 12-week duration, dosages of 6.9 46,47or 9.96 g/d51ALA, and small sample sizes, which may have resulted in null findings for ASTand GGT.It should also be noted in some of the study arms, baseline ALT levels were within the upper-Figure 5A Forest plot of differences in blood glucose between n-3 and placebo arms.Abbreviation : CI, confidence interval.

The findings for this study are in agreement with a systematic review and meta-analyses of 7 RCTs by He et al, 21who showed the efficacy of marine n-3 including fish oil was unclear in relation toglycemic-control markers. The findings of this studyagree with the growing consensus in recent literature showing that, despite improvements in insulin sensitiv- ity in rodent studies, the vast majority of human inter-vention studies fail to demonstrate beneficial effects ofn-3 fatty acids in glycemic-control biomarkers in type 2diabetes or insulin resistance.65,66 Lipid profiles The meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in plant-based n-3 from flaxseed oil and algal oil on TGs(P¼0.01) and a trend in lowering LDL-C ( P¼0.05).Patients with NAFLD have a substantially increased riskof mortality from CVD, 67,68and lipid profiles form an important part of CVD risk management.69Moderate increases in LDL-C in patients with NAFLD canincrease the risk of a cardiovascular event.
70The signifi- cant TG reductions are important as TG measurementrepresents a useful noninvasive biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of NAFLD progression.71 This study’s findings relating to plant-based n-3 supple- mentation and changes in lipid profiles partially agree with recently published literature. Meta-analyses of flax- seed oil supplementation studies and CVD risk by Hadi et al29and Masjedi et al31showed flaxseed supplemen- tation significantly lowered TGs ( P<0.05).In contrast to the findings of the present review, significant reduc- tions were also shown for TC ( P¼0.01).However, both meta-analyses had higher numbers of studies/partici-pants and therefore greater statistical power than the present study.In a meta-analysis of 47 RCTs with 1305 individuals, Yue et al 72showed that dietary intake of ALA significantly ( P<0.05) reduced lipid profile bio- markers.
A meta-analysis by Naghshi et al73showed that a high intake of ALA (defined as /C213 g/d) was sig- nificantly ( P<0.05) associated with a lower risk of death from CVD and coronary heart disease comparedwith low intake (defined as /C200.35 g/d). Body composition The meta-analyses showed significant improvements in body-composition measures, including BMI (MD: /C01.83 kg/m 2; 95% CI: /C02.99,/C00.68; P¼0.00; I2¼ 76.37%), WC (MD: /C03.21 cm; 95% CI: /C04.92,/C01.50; P¼0.00; I2¼20.32%), and weight (MD: /C04.68 kg; 95% CI:/C08.33,/C01.04; P¼0.01; I2¼0.00%).Weight loss is widely recognized as the most effective treatment for NAFLD,63,74with current treatment guidelines recom- mending lifestyle interventions aiming to lose 7–10% oftotal weight in patients with NAFLD.5,63Improvements in body composition compare with previously pub- lished lifestyle intervention studies.
A systematic reviewand meta-analyses by Katsagoni et al 75showed that diet interventions and exercise decreased BMI and WC from 20 RCTs with 1073 patients with NAFLD. Improvements in body composition also translated to liver enzyme biomarkers, which showed significantdecreases in ALT and AST (both P<0.05).Yari 2016 Pacifico 2015 Yari 2021 Overall Heterogeneity: τ2=0 .0 0 , I2=0 .0 0 % , H2=1 .0 0 Test of θ = 0: t(2) = -0.33, p = 0.74Study 25 25 24NOmega-3 -2.05 100 129.17Mean 15.19 12080.58 6418.41SD 25 26 21NPlacebo -1.02 -550 -770.14Mean 4.15 9054.4663 3227.99SD -5000 0 5000 10000with 95% CIMean difference -1.03 ( 650.00 ( 899.31 ( -1.03 (-7.20, -5226.89, -2016.16, -7.20,5.14) 6526.89) 3814.78) 5.15)100.00 0.00 0.00(%)Weight Figure 7 Forest plot of differences in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein between n-3 and placebo arms.Abbreviation : CI, confidence interval.158 Nutrition ReviewsVRVol.

Potential mechanisms of beneficial effects of n-3 treatment for NAFLD Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are catego- rized by the presence of a double bond at the third car- bon atom from the methyl end of the carbon chain.4 Where direct marine-based n-3 sources are scarce or not present in the diet, n-3 ALA (18:3; which was usedin the 3 adult RCTs in the present review) 46,47,51must undergo conversion to the more biologically active lon- ger chain highly unsaturated EPA (20:5)76and DHA (22:6)77in the n-3 metabolic pathway. High dietary n-6 ratios, which are indicative of low n-3 intakes, can beproinflammatory and limit the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA in the n-3 metabolic pathway.34,78Those consuming low intakes of n-3 coupled with a high n-6to n-3 dietary fatty acid ratio are at increased risk ofdeveloping NAFLD.
15,79Incorporating a direct sourceof DHA, which was used in the child/adolescent RCTs identified in the present review,53,54,56is the most effec- tive way to obtain DHA in the diet for low/non–fishconsumers. 34,41The molecular mechanisms causing the initiation and progression of NAFLD have yet to befully recognized and understood; however, inflamma- tion and oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species are likely to be significant mechanisms that canlead to hepatic cell death and tissue injury.80NAFLD is usually believed to have a mutual and bidirectional nexus with metabolic syndrome and its individual com- ponents and, therefore, to be a noncommunicable dis-ease.However, Helicobacter pylori infection is also believed to play a role in the development of NAFLD, as does the gut microbiota.
81–84Dietary n-3 fatty acids are thought to have beneficial effects in bioactive metabo-lites involved in inflammatory pathways and livermetabolism, including the reduction in hepatic TGFigure 8A Forest plot of differences in body mass index between n-3 and placebo arms.

pylori –associated gastric diseases.85However, further studies are required to evaluate the underlying mecha- nisms involved.4,19,79,85 Strengths and limitations To the authors’ knowledge this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of plant- based n-3 fatty acid interventions on NAFLD bio- markers and parameters. However, there are limitations that should be considered.The systematic search crite- ria identified 6 RCTs with 362 patients with NAFLD, representing a small number of participants and shortstudy durations compared with similar systematic reviews and meta-analysis that have evaluated fish/ marine-based oil n-3 supplementation.As the search criteria identified that there have only been 6 relevant clinical trials investigating the topic since 1970, this highlights an overall scarcity of plant-based n-3 inter- vention studies in this area of research.
The use of liverenzyme measurements on the whole may be a limita- tion as up to 78% of patients with NAFLD have liver enzyme biomarkers within normal ranges. 2The rela- tively short duration of studies may limit inferences on the discordance between results of significance between ALT, AST, and GGT.The AST-to-ALT ratio can be a useful indicator of fibrosis in NAFLD86; however, the study by Rezaei et al51was the only RCT identified in the present study to use this measure, which showed no significant differences between the active treatment control and intervention groups.Outcomes in this review (biomarkers and parameters) are surrogate end- points, which might not directly translate to patient benefit or predict improvements in clinical outcomesfor patients.
5,87The measurement of surrogate bio- markers in the identified studies with no histological confirmation of the diagnosis and outcomes does not address American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver NAFLD/NASH accepted endpoints, including changes in liver steatosis, hepatic inflammation, andfibrosis. 84,88A number of publications have used mag- netic resonance imaging for the noninvasive measure- ment of adult and adolescent liver steatosis19,89,90; however, none of the studies identified in this review used magnetic resonance imaging measurements tomonitor the effectiveness of interventions.The study findings concerning body composition represent a key limitation as it was not possible to delimit and separate the beneficial effects of plant-based n-3 and weight loss, the first-line standard-caretreatment for NAFLD 5in the meta-analysis.
However, it is noteworthy that the control/placebo groups in 3 of the 6 included studies by Pacifico et al53(active treat- ment control: wheat germ oil), Yari et al,46and Della Corte et al56(inactive treatment control) showed signif- icant reductions to BMI in plant-based n-3 intervention groups ( P<0.05) but not in the control/placebo groups despite the same lifestyle intervention. Significant heterogeneity was found in the present meta-analyses.The effect of plant-based n-3 supple- mentation in young and adult populations may be affected by type, duration, dosage, and further effects of weight loss.However, due to the limited number of rel- atively short-term studies focusing on this area, and translational small patient cohorts included in the meta-analysis, it was not possible to conduct further subgroup analysis to identify potential sources of heter- ogeneity; hence, the results need to be interpreted with caution.
Some of the null findings could be related to the dosages administered or the samples sizes used. The search did not identify any studies that made direct comparisons between marine and plant-based n-3 fatty acid sources in surrogate NAFLD biomarkers.Further consideration must be given to wheat germ oil,91which was used as a placebo/control in RCTs by Pacifico et al53and Nobili et al54and represents a good source of vitamin E and n-6 ( a-tocopherol /C241179 mg/ kg and b-tocopherol /C24398 mg/kg; linolenic acid: 49– 60% [n-6]).91Vitamin E supplementation shows benefi- cial effects in patients with NAFLD, both with and with- out weight loss, as evidenced by several systematic reviews and meta-analyses92–94and the Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial,95posing a potential limitation for the studies using a wheat germ oil placebo/controls.
In the present review, neither of the 2 RCTs53,54specified the exact quantity of wheat germ oil used, stating a dose of 290 mg/d linolenic acid (n-6), representing 49–60% of fatty acids in wheat germ oil composition.91A cross- sectional study in 6693 adults in the United States showed that both dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids may offer benefits in NAFLD; however, further studies are needed to verify this and to identify the associated mechanisms. The summary findings in Table 2 show that there were no significant improvements between baseline and endpoint for any of the biomarkers included in the meta-analysis for the comparator groups in studies using wheat germ oil as a placebo/ control.A further limitation of this meta-analysis is that the 3 included studies of adult populations were all con- ducted in 1 country, Iran.As such, these studies may be affected by environmental factors such as local diet that Nutrition ReviewsVRVol.
82(2):143–165 161 may not be applicable in other countries. This may also limit the generalizability of the results to other, diverse populations and/or ethnicities.The use of whole ground flaxseed by Yari et al46,47in 2 of the 3 identified adult stud- ies may also represent a confounding effect as fiber intake is known to ameliorate NAFLD96; this may have added to the heterogeneity between studies.Due to the limitednumber of studies in this area, there is a lack of consensus surrounding effective doses of ALA for the amelioration of NAFLD.The adult RCTs identified in the review used flaxseed interventions and the child/adolescent RCTs used algal oil comprising ALA and DHA, respectively.
Thechild studies used doses of either 250 or 500 mg/d DHA, which is in line with dietary recommendations based on cardiovascular risk considerations for European adults;again, there is a lack of consensus surrounding effective DHA doses for NAFLD in children and adolescents due the shortage of published studies. It was not possible toseparate the effect for the 2 different n-3 sources; although the identified studies included study arm demographics for males and females, none of them conducted separatestatistical analyses by sex and reproductive status, which can account for differences in prevalence, risk factors, fib- rosis, and clinical outcomes in NAFLD.97 Future directions Research investigating the distinct effects of n-3 supple- mentation in separate male and female populations iswarranted.This highlights a gap in the evidence for DHA-based adult studies and ALA-based child/adoles- cent studies.Both sources have shown improvements incardiometabolic risk biomarkers.
34,72However, their effects on NAFLD parameters have yet to be extensively evaluated. Furthermore, none of the RCTs identified in the present review examined plant-based EPA or EPA and DHA combined (mainly found in algal oils),34 which are thought to be the most health advantageous sources of n-3.98Further RCTs are now needed to investigate the potential benefits of ALA from flaxseedoil and EPA/DHA- and DHA-rich algal oil on NAFLD biomarkers using appropriate placebo/controls, larger numbers of patients with NAFLD, and longer studydurations to address these limitations.In addition to the analysis of NAFLD surrogate markers, provision for additional noninvasive markers such as magnetic reso-nance imaging should be included in future studies.
CONCLUSION When combined with lifestyle interventions to increase physical activity and a calorie-controlled diet, plant- based n-3 fatty acid supplementation leads to improve-m e n t si nA L Te n z y m eb i o m a r k e r s ,T G s ,B M I ,W C ,a n dweight loss, therefore offering a potential adjunct to the first-line treatment of lifestyle modification (ie, losing 7–10% of weight by diet and exercise). Further well- designed human studies are needed to better understand the beneficial effects offered by plant-based n-3 fattyacids, with and without lifestyle and dietary interventionsand with a specific focus on the different effects of ALA,and plant-based EPA and DHA using larger numbers of patients with NAFLD and longer study durations.Acknowledgment The authors thank Mrs.Jackie Fealey (Librarian, Liverpool John Moores University) for support andassistance with the database searches.Author contributions.The authors’ contributions were as follows—K.E.L.and I.P.
