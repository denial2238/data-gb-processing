Jayasena1, Samooel Jung1, Hyun Joo Kim, Sun Hyo Kim1, and Cheorun Jo * Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Center for Food and Bioconvergence, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea 1Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 305-764, Korea Abstract Chicken breast meat was injected with calcium chloride alone and in combination with lactic acid (0.01% and 0.002%, respectively). The inhibitory effects of the treatments on microbial growth were determined in the injected chicken breast meat stored at 4°C under aerobic packaging condition for 0, 3, and 7 d.Calcium chloride combined with 0.002% and 0.01% lactic acid reduced microbial counts by 0.14 and 1.08 Log CFU/g, respectively, however, calcium chloride alone was unableto inhibit microbial growth.
Calcium chloride combined with 0.01% lactic acid was the most effective antimicrobial treat- ment and resulted in the highest initial redness value. Calcium chloride alone and combined with lactic acid suppressed changes in pH and the Hunter color values during storage.However, injection of calcium chloride and lactic acid hadadverse effects on lipid oxidation and sensory characteristics.The higher TBARS values were observed in samples treated with calcium chloride and lactic acid when compared to control over the storage period.Addition of calcium chloride and lactic acid resulted in lower sensory scores for parameters tested, except odor and color, compared to control samples.Therefore, the formulation should be improved in order to overcome such defects prior to industrial application.
Key words: calcium chloride, lactic acid, injection, breast meat, shelf life Introduction There are ever increasing concerns on the safety of poultry meat due to its inherent association with food-borne pathogens. During poultry processing, cross-con-tamination and a subsequent increase in the bacterial load of the final product may occur (Luber and Reiher, 2009).Therefore, reducing the microbial load in the final prod-uct would extend its shelf life and be beneficial for pro-cessors, retailers, and consumers.The above-mentioned concerns have led to the devel- opment and application of several thermal and non-ther-mal food preservation technologies, alone or in combina- tion, for many years in order to control spoilage and pa- thogenic microorganisms (Jayasena and Jo, 2013).
Mari-nation as a method of value addition has become an inte-gral part of the meat industry due to the increasing de-mands of consumers for further processed, ready-to-eat, and convenient foods (Alvarado and Mckee, 2007). There-fore, the use of marinades to improve the microbiologicaland technological qualities of meat products has been pro-ven as an effective processing and preservation methodover the past 30 years (Jensen et al., 2003).The salts of lactic acid and various other weak acids are used in enhancement solutions as effective microbial inhi-bitors (Doores, 2005).Several studies have documentedthe efficacy of organic acids in the reduction of entericpathogens on carcasses and derived cuts (Bosilevac et al., 2006; González-Fandos et al., 2009).Lactic acid is a non- toxic, weak acid naturally produced in meat and meat products and offers the possibility of reducing contamina- tion of meat and meat products (Cardenas et al., 2008).
Hence, it is a generally regarded as safe antimicrobialagent that is commonly used in meat and meat productsfor decontamination (Kotula and Thelappurate, 1994). Traditionally, acidic marinades were used to improve the flavor and texture of prepared meat products during storage (Kijowski and Mast, 1993).Injection of marinadesallows more rapid diffusion of the acid into the muscle *Corresponding author: Cheorun Jo, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea.Tel: 82-2-880-4804; Fax: 82-2-873-2271, E-mail: che-orun@snu.ac.krARTICLE 222 Korean J.Food Sci.An., Vol.34, No.2 (2014) and results in a rapid decrease in mechanical strength and increase in tenderness (Eilers et al., 1994).However, aci- dic marinades have recently become more popular asantimicrobial ingredients.
As reviewed by Doores (2005),lactic acid was able to inhibit the growth of many types offood spoilage bacteria, including gram-negative species of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae. Moreover, organic acids (acetic, formic, and lactic) imp-roved the shelf life by decreasing microbial loads on meatproducts (Özdemir et al., 2006).This antimicrobial effect was attributed to both reduction of the pH below therange required for microbial growth and metabolic inhibi- tion due to undissociated acid molecules (Alvarado and Mckee, 2007).However, the main limitation of using or-ganic acids in meat systems is the discoloration of meatcuts, especially at higher concentrations of organic acids(Kotula and Thelappurate, 1994).Sawyer et al .(2009) demonstrated color stability of meat after incorporation oflactic acid.Therefore, changes in sensory parameters (color and flavor) should be taken into consideration when using acidic marinades.
In addition to acidic marinades, alkali salt phosphate marinade systems increase the water-holding capacity andtenderize the meat. Most recently, treatment with calciumchloride as an alkaline marinade has become a popular method for meat tenderization because of the ease of ap- plication and safe nature (Gerelt et al., 2002).Calcium chloride treatment has been applied either to pre- or post-rigor muscle tissues as an effective means of improvingmeat tenderness (Wheeler et al., 1992).In addition to im- proving the tenderness, the calcium chloride marination technology would improve other economically important traits such as extending color life and inhibiting microbialgrowth (Lawrence et al ., 2003).Furthermore, meat injec- ted with calcium chloride may serve as an additionalsource of calcium because meat is widely consumed at allages (Heaney and Barger-Lux, 1991).
Although extensive studies have been conducted on the effects of calcium chloride treatment on texture improve- ment, little information is available on the effect of suchtreatment on the microbial inhibition in meat and meatproducts. However, some sensory properties, e.g., colorand flavor, can be altered by this treatment depending onthe concentration used (Lansdell et al., 1995).Several stu- dies have shown that calcium chloride conveyed a bitter, metallic, and sour taste to cooked products (Eilers et al., 1994; Morris et al., 1997).Therefore, the concentration of calcium chloride should be carefully selected (Lansdellet al., 1995).In addition, because the dietary intake oflactic acid and calcium chloride is not limited, their use in meat products is favorable (Mani-Lopez et al., 2012).Chicken breast is one of the most popular and easily preparable type of meat used for grilling and can absorbgreater amounts of marinade compared to the thigh.
Hence,chicken breast is widely used in the “seasoned” meat industry all over the world with differently modified rec- ipes. However, quality attributes of marinated meat prod-ucts could be deteriorated due to the microbial growthand it cause a public health hazard along with economicloss to the industry.The recent focus is to use differentantimicrobial hurdles together in the food preservation such as low and high temperature, acidity, antimicrobial compounds, and thermal and non-thermal sterilization.Therefore, an effective combination of different antimi-crobial hurdles in meat products can work in synergy andthereby provide a good antimicrobial effect.Our objective in this study was to determine the inhibi- tory effects of calcium chloride alone and in combination with lactic acid on microbial growth upon injection into chicken meat packaged under aerobic conditions andstored at 4°C.
Materials and Methods Sample preparationAll necessary ingredients for the production of different marinades and the fresh skinless chicken breast meat usedin this study were obtained from a local market (Daejeon,Korea). The chicken breast meat samples were immedi-ately transported to the laboratory in a polystyrene box containing ice and stored in refrigerator at 4°C for less than 12 h until further use.Marinades The basal marinade was prepared by mixing corn syrup, sugar, soy sauce, onion, welsh onion, pears, sesame oil,garlic, table salt, monosodium glutamate, sesame, caramel, and ginger with water.
Four treatment marinades were prepared: i) Control: basal marinade with no additive, ii)3% of calcium chloride (ES Food Industry, Korea): basalmarinade with 3% calcium chloride, iii) 3% of calciumchloride with 0.002% lactic acid: basal marinade with 3%of calcium chloride and 0.002% lactic acid and iv) 3% of calcium chloride with lactic acid at 0.01%: basal mari- nade with 3% of calcium chloride and 0.01% lactic acid.All marinades were prepared in the same day of the ex-periment and held at 4°C until required and the prelimi-nary trials were conducted to determine the appropriate Antimicrobial Effect of Calcium Chloride and Lactic Acid Combination 223 marinade formulation and the cooking conditions to be used in this study. Marination and storage of samples The breast meat samples were randomly assigned to the control and three treatments separately.
Prior to the mari- nation, the breast meat samples were weighed, and then injected with their respective marinades (15% w/w) usinga single-needle injector (Doo Won Meditec Co. Ltd.,Korea).The marinades were pumped deeply into the meatpieces in every side in order to ensure the homogenousdistribution of marinade ingredients.Each treated sample was subsequently divided into small portions (approxi- mately 25 g), aerobically packaged in oxygen-permeablepolyethylene bags and stored at 4°C until analysis at 0, 3,and 7 d.Microbiological analysis Microbial analysis was carried out initially after injec- tion of the marinades and at 0, 3 and 7 d of storage at 4 oC.Each sample (5 g) was cut into small pieces and homoge-nized for 2 min in a sterile stomacher bag (bag mixer 400;Interscience Co., France) containing 45 mL of sterile sa-line (0.85%).Then, those were serially diluted in sterilesaline (0.85%), and each diluent (0.1 mL) was spread on respective bacterial media.
Plate count agar and eosine methylene blue agar (Difco Laboratories, USA) were usedfor the determination of total bacterial flora and coliforms,respectively. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h,and the microbial counts were expressed as Log CFU/g.pH measurement Each sample (1 g) was homogenized with 9 mL of dis- tilled water using a mechanical homogenizer (Ika Labora-tory Equipment, Korea) and filtered (Whatman No.4, GEHealthcare UK Ltd., UK).The pH value of the filtrate wasmeasured using an electronic pH meter (Mettler ToledoProcess Analytics, USA) at room temperature, which was initially calibrated using standard phosphate buffers.The electrode was washed thoroughly with distilled water bet-ween measurements.The mean value of three repeatedmeasurements from each sample was used.
Instrumental color measurement The surface color measurements (CIE L*, a*, and b* values representing lightness, redness and yellowness, res-pectively) of the marinated chicken breast meat sampleswere evaluated immediately after the sampling and dur-ing the storage period using a colorimeter (Spectropho-tometer, CR-300, Minolta Inc., Japan) which was calibra- ted against a black and a white reference tiles. Measure-ments of L*, a* and b* values were taken at three differ-ent locations of each of the three replicates from eachtreatment.Lipid oxidation Lipid oxidation was measured at 0, 3 and 7 d as 2- thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) value ofeach sample (Jung et al ., 2011).Nine mL of distilled water and 50 mL BHT (7.2% in ethanol) were added toeach meat sample (3 g).The mixture was then homoge- nized (Ika Laboratory Equipment, Korea) at 16,000 rpm for 20 s.
The homogenate (1 mL) was transferred to a testtube and then mixed with 2 mL of thiobarburic acid(TBA)/trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution (20 mM TBAin 15% TCA). After that, the test tubes were heated in awater bath at 90°C for 15 min, cooled in cold water, andcentrifuged (Union 32R, Hanil Co.Ltd., Korea) at 3,000 rpm for 10 min.The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm with a spectrophotometer (DU 530;Beckman Instruments Inc., USA).The amount of malon-dialdehyde was calculated using a standard curve preparedfrom tetraethoxypropane, and the TBARS value was re-ported as mg malondialdehyde/kg meat.Sensory evaluation In the present study, the marinated chicken meat sam- ples were evaluated for their sensory qualities at the firstday of sampling as three repeated sessions.
The samples(2.0×3.0×1.5 cm) were pan-fried in an electric grill with double pans (Nova EMG-553, 1400 W, Evergreen, Korea) for 4 min to achieve a core temperature of approximately72 oC as measured by a digital thermometer (YF-160A- type-K, YFE, Taiwan). Immediately after the preparation of the cooked prod- ucts, each sample was placed in a white plastic tray withrandomly coded 3 digit numbers and provided for the evaluation.Water was provided between the samples to cleanse the oral cavity.The cooked samples were evalu-ated for color, odor, flavor, taste, tenderness and overallacceptability by seven semi-trained panelists who haveexperience in sensory evaluation of chicken meat for morethan one year.The panel was asked to indicate whether the products had an acceptable or unacceptable (deviating) taste, flavor, and odor.A 9-point hedonic scale was used(9=like extremely, 5=like moderately, 1=dislike extremely)in this study.224 Korean J.Food Sci.An., Vol.34, No.
2 (2014) Statistical analysis The data of this experiment was analyzed using a one- way analysis of variance by the procedure of general lin-ear model using SAS program (SAS version 9.3, SASInstitute, USA). The whole experimental procedures weretriplicated.The differences among the mean values were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test at a confi- dence level of p<0.05.The mean values and standard errors of the means are reported.Results and Discussion Microbiological analysisThe additive effects of calcium chloride alone and in combination with lactic acid on the growth of total aero-bic bacteria in chicken breast meat are shown in Table 1.Treatment of samples with calcium chloride combinedwith 0.002% or 0.01% lactic acid resulted in significantlylower initial microbial counts than those observed with other treatments.Compared to control samples, the treated samples showed a reduction in microbial counts by 0.14and 1.08 Log CFU/g, respectively.
No significant differ-ence in microbial counts was observed between controland breast samples treated with calcium chloride at 0 d.However, calcium chloride treatment significantly low- ered the growth of microorganisms during the rest of the storage period. Calcium chloride combined with 0.01%lactic acid showed the greatest inhibitory effect through-out the storage period.However, calcium chloride alonewas unable to inhibit microbial growth to the extent thatcombined treatments did.Significant differences were found between total aerobic counts of treated samples and untreated control samples at 3 d and 7 d of storage; by 3 d,the microbial counts of control samples were higher than7 Log CFU/g.However, even at the end of the storage period, the microbial counts of treated samples had notreached 7 Log CFU/g.Nevertheless, the microbial countsin breast meat samples increased over the storage period,regardless of the treatment.
In this study, the combination of calcium chloride and lactic acid was the most effective antimicrobial treatment. Furthermore, increasing the lactic acid concentration wasbeneficial with regard to microbial reduction becausecombined treatment with 0.01% lactic acid had a greaterinhibitory effect than combined treatment with 0.002%lactic acid.When the acidity in marinade increases, diffu- sion across membranes and into the cytoplasm of microbes may increase, too.In general, microorganisms have spe-cific pH requirements for growth and a pH range withinwhich their growth is possible.Thus, even a small decreasein the pH by organic acids is sufficient to prevent thegrowth of many bacteria (Stratford and Anslow, 1998).
Inprevious studies, lactic acid had been shown to possess antimicrobial activity against many pathogenic organisms, e.g., Clostridium botulinum , because of its ability to reduce the pH, exert feedback inhibition, and interfere with theproton transfer across cell membranes (Davidson et al., 2005; Doores, 2005). Furthermore, the initial total aerobiccount of chicken breast dipped in lactic acid decreased by 0.53 to 2.36 Log CFU/g (Anang et al., 2010).Similarly, the antimicrobial effect of calcium chloride combined withlactic acid was revealed by Eilers et al.(1994), who obs- erved a significant reduction in microbial growth, whileimprovements in tenderness were maintained in hot boned-round cuts.However, the antibacterial effects of organic acids de- pend on two factors, i.e., pH and degree of dissociation ofthe acid.
In addition, it is known that the antibacterialeffect of lactic acid varies depending on the concentrationof the acid, temperature of the solution, and method andtime of application (Tamblyn and Conner, 1997). In addition, several agents in salt solutions such as cal- cium chloride can endow bacterial growth inhibition.Ele- vated osmolality due to salt addition may trigger the os-moregulatory process causing increased maintenance me-tabolism and leading to reduced bacterial growth (Yaganzaet al., 2009).Our study confirmed the findings of Yaganza et al.(2009) who reported that the acidity or alkalinity of the medium caused by addition of salts could have adverse effects on bacterial growth.Extreme pH conditions canlead to the denaturation of proteins, including enzymespresent on the cell surface, depolarization of transportsystems for essential ions and nutrients, modification of Table 1.

pH value Marination with calcium chloride alone and combined with lactic acid had significant effects on the initial pHvalues of chicken breast meat samples (Table 2). The pH values decreased immediately following treatment with calcium chloride alone and in combination with 0.002%and 0.01% lactic acid by 0.79, 0.71, and 0.71, respectively,in comparison to control samples.The highest pH valueswere observed in control samples throughout the storageperiod, whereas no significant differences in the pH val-ues were found among the treated samples at 0 and 3 d of storage; however, significant differences were found at 7 d.The pH value of the control samples increased signifi-cantly during storage.However, there were no significantchanges in the pH between samples treated with calciumchloride alone and combined with 0.002% lactic acid upto 7 d.
A slight change in the pH was observed in samples treated with calcium chloride combined with 0.01% lactic acid, which was reversed by the end of the storage period.Therefore, treatment with calcium chloride and lactic acidstabilized the pH value in injected chicken breast meat. The increase in the pH during the storage period could be attributed to accumulation of ammonia by bacteria (Gill, 1983).Moreover, the initial pH reduction following combined treatments could be explained by the bufferingcapacity of acidulates, which released protons, resultingin a smaller impact on the pH of the media (Thomas etal., 2002).In general, post-mortem pH values of avian muscles decrease very rapidly from near neutrality toabout 5.6 to 5.8 within 6 to 8 h (Stewart et al., 1984).
Be- cause the increase in cytosolic calcium is a main determi-nant of the onset of rigor mortis, one would suppose thatthe addition of calcium would prompt the process and lower the pH of calcium-treated muscles (Young and Lyon, 1997). However, the initial pH values did not decreasesignificantly in the present study.These results were inagreement with those of another study that showed thatthe addition of lactic acid to meat systems such as porkand beef resulted in lower initial pH values and reduced the post enhancement muscle pH (Aktas et al., 2003).Instrumental color value The instrumental color values of the injected chicken breast meat samples indicated that the highest a* valuewas observed in samples treated with calcium chloridecombined with 0.01% lactic acid at 0 d ( p<0.05; Table 3).However, no significant changes were observed among the treatments during the storage period.
It has been shown that lactic acid has greater affinity for deoxymyoglobin than oxymyoglobin of normal-pH meat,which leads to a steady, unbloomed color with low con-centration of lactic acid. This is caused by the ability of lactic acid to change the oxygen binding properties of myoglobin (Giardina et al., 1996).Moreover, Kim et al.(2006) demonstrated that injecting normal-pH beef striploins with lactic acid caused regeneration of the reducedform of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) viaincreased lactate dehydrogenase activity; the increase in NADH production resulted in the reduction of metmyo- globin.Sawyer et al.(2009) more recently noted positive effects of lactic acid on the improvement of instrumentaland subjective measures of the fresh color of beef.Simi-lar results with regard to the color enhancement throughlactic acid were obtained by several other authors, whichare in agreement with our results (Kim et al., 2006).
No significant changes in the L* value were observed among the treated samples throughout the storage period(Table 3). Significantly higher L* values compared to con-trol samples were noted in treated samples at 3 d of stor-age.Whereas no changes in the L* value were observed insamples subjected to combined treatments over the stor- age period, that of samples treated with calcium chloride alone did change.Moreover, there was no significant dif-ference in the b* values between the treatment groups(Table 3).However, a significant increase in the b* valuewas detected in samples injected with calcium chloride Table 2.

(1998) who reported a higher lightness of calcium chloride-marinated meat samples from chicken, horse,cattle, and rabbit. Furthermore, according to the findingsof Aktas and Kaya (2001), the lower pH values of acid- treated samples may have resulted in denaturation of sar- coplasmic and myofibrillar proteins, which may alter theirwater-binding ability.Therefore, the amount of water dis-persed among the muscle fibers could affect the reflec-tance ability of the meat.The increased lightness causedby calcium chloride treatment was probably due to themore intense disruption of myofibrils because of the acti- vation of calpains by calcium (Aktas and Kaya, 2001).However, the use of appropriate amounts of lactic acid is important to determine the effect on the fresh and coo-ked color of meat.Kotula and Thelappurate (1994) repor-ted that lactic acid concentrations of 1.2% and 1.5% cau-sed color deterioration in beef samples during display.
TBARS value As illustrated in Table 4, there were no differences ( p> 0.05) in the initial TBARS values among the treatmentgroups. At 3 d of storage, the highest TBARS value wasobserved in samples treated with calcium chloride com- bined with 0.01% lactic acid followed by combination with 0.002% lactic acid; however, the highest value was found at 7 d in samples treated with calcium chloridealone followed by the groups of combined treatment.Sig-nificantly, higher values were observed in samples treatedwith calcium chloride and lactic acid in comparison tocontrol samples over the storage period.However, the TBARS values increased over the storage period ( p<0.05) in all treatment groups.Therefore, in the present study,calcium chloride alone or in combination with lactic acidwas not effective in inhibiting lipid oxidation in meatsamples.These data are in agreement with those of HarrisTable 3.

Sensory evaluation Sensory analysis of the chicken breast meat samples re- vealed that addition of calcium chloride and lactic acidresulted in lower sensory scores for all parameters, exceptodor and color, compared to control samples (Table 5). The addition of calcium chloride had no apparent tender- izing effect on cooked meat in comparison to controls.Chicken breast meat injected with calcium chloride aloneand combined with 0.002% lactic acid did not show sig-nificant differences in any of the sensory parameters.Mo-reover, no differences ( p>0.05) were observed in flavor, taste, and tenderness among samples treated with calcium chloride alone and combined with 0.01% lactic acid.Thelowest values for color and odor were noted in samplestreated with calcium chloride combined with 0.01% lacticacid ( p<0.05), whereas no significant differences were found between samples treated with calcium chloride alone and combined with 0.002% lactic acid.
Panelists rated all samples and the control samples received thehighest overall acceptability score followed by samplestreated with calcium chloride alone and combined withlactic acid; there were no differences among the treatedsamples ( p>0.05). Negative color attributes were observed when lactic acid was used in marinades, i.e., the meat color changed to a dark gray or gray-brown (Sawyer et al., 2009), which is in agreement with our study.More importantlyand similar to our findings, a few studies had shown thatcalcium solutions conveyed an aftertaste and bitter flavor(Eilers et al., 1994; Perez et al., 1998), whereas Gonzalez et al .(2001) demonstrated that such marinades had no negative effect on meat odor and flavor.The different results obtained by Perez et al.(1998) were probably due to the more efficient incorporation of calcium salt.
There-fore, if the concentration and volume of antimicrobialcompounds injected into meat could be reduced, negativeeffects on flavor could be avoided. According to the find- ings of Morris et al.(1997), injection of calcium chloride and lactic acid increased livery, soured, medicinal andbrowned aromatics, metallic and astringent mouth feels,salt, and sour and bitter basic tastes and decreased beef/brothy and serumy/bloody aromatics.Therefore, deter-mining the optimal concentrations of salts and organicacids to ensure better sensory attributes is a challenge and requires further investigations.The use of flavorings and antioxidants in combination with other additives couldimprove nutritional and sensory attributes; however, fur-ther studies are required to obtain such benefits withoutcompromising microbial safety.In conclusion, combined treatment with calcium chlo- ride and lactic acid could effectively maintain the micro- bial quality of injected chicken breast meat.
Treatmentwith calcium chloride alone and in combination with lac-tic acid suppressed changes in pH and Hunter color val-ues during aerobic storage. However, these treatments hadnegative effects on lipid oxidation and certain sensory cha- racteristics.These effects need to be minimized or averted by improving the formulation in further experiments.Acknowledgements This work was supported by a grant from the Next- Generation BioGreen 21 Program (No.0081330), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.References 1.Aktas, N.and Kaya, M.(2001) The influence of marinating with weak organic acids and salts on the intramuscular con-nective tissue and sensory properties of beef.Eur.Food Res.Technol.213, 88-94.2.Aktas, N., Aksu, M.I., and Kaya, M.(2003) The effect of or- ganic acid marination on tenderness, cooking loss and boundwater content of beef.J.Muscle Foods 14, 181-194.3.Alvarado, C.and Mckee, S.(2007) Marination to improveTable 5.
