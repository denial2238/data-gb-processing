Original Research Muscle Protein Synthesis in Response to Plant-Based Protein Isolates With and Without Added Leucine Versus Whey Protein in Young Menand Women Changhyun Limy, Tom AH Jansseny, Brad S Currier, Nelani Paramanantharajah, James McKendry, Sidney Abou Sawan, Stuart M Phillips* Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada ABSTRACT Background: Plant-based protein supplements often contain lower amounts of leucine and other essential amino acids (EAAs), potentially making them less effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis (MPS) than animal-based proteins.Combining plant proteins could improve the EAA pro ﬁle and more effectively support MPS.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a novel plant-based blend protein (PBP), PBP with added leucine (PBP þ Leu) to levels equivalent to whey protein isolate (WHEY) on aminoacidemia and MPS responses in young men and women.
We hypothesizedthat PBP þLeu would stimulate MPS equivalent to WHEY, and both would be greater than PBP. Methods: We employed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study consisting of 3 separate study visits to compare PBP, PBP þLeu, and WHEY.To measure MPS response to ingestion of the supplements, a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring 13C6] phenylalanine was administered for 8 h at each study visit.Skeletal muscle tissue and blood samples were collected to measure aminoacidemia and MPS.Results: All protein supplements increased mixed MPS above postabsorptive levels ( P<0.001).However, MPS increase following ingestion of PBP was less than that following ingestion of PBP þLeu ( P¼0.002) and WHEY ( P¼0.046).There were no differences in MPS between PBPþLeu and WHEY ( P¼0.052).Conclusions: Consumption of PBP isolate with added leucine stimulated MPS to a similar extent as whey protein in young men and women.
PBPs containing higher leucine content promote anabolism to a similar extent as animal-based proteins. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05139160.Keywords : protein supplement, essential amino acid, skeletal muscle, anabolism Introduction Muscle mass accretion occurs when the net balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown is positive.MPS is the variable most responsive to protein intakeand exercise and the locus of control for positive muscle proteinbalance in healthy individuals [ 1,2].Dietary proteins provide essential amino acids (EAAs), which are indispensable compo-nents to building muscle proteins and directly stimulate MPS viamolecular pathways [ 3].The quality of dietary protein isevaluated by its digestibility and amino acid (AA) pro ﬁle [4,5].Compared to animal-based protein, most plant-based proteinshave a lower digestibility and a relatively lower EAA content perserving, with a limiting amount of one or more EAAs [ 6].
Leucine is the key EAA that stimulates MPS via activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway [ 3,7]. However, most plant proteins have a lower leucine content [ 8].For example, ingestion of plant-based protein results in a loweranabolic response compared with ingestion of isonitrogenousanimal-source proteins in young and older individuals [ 9,10].Abbreviations: AA, amino acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; EAA, essential amino acid; GC-C-IRMS, gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spec- trometry; iAUC, incremental area under the curve; MPS, muscle protein synthesis; PBP, plant-based blend protein; PBP þLeu, plant-based blend protein forti ﬁed with leucine; PITC, phenyl isothiocyanate; VAS, visual analog scale; WHEY, whey protein isolate.* Corresponding author.E-mail address: phillis@mcmaster.ca (S.M.Phillips).

Combining 2 different sources of plant protein isolate can improve EAA pro ﬁles because one protein source can compensate for lower EAA in the other protein source [ 14,15]. Pinckaers et al.[ 16] reported that the ingestion of a plant-based protein blend (wheat, corn, and pea) stimulated muscle proteinsynthetic response to a similar extent as an equivalent amount ofmilk protein.To offer a broader spectrum of plant-based proteinoptions, it is worth exploring novel combinations of diverse plantsources.We aimed to examine the effect of a plant-based blend pro- tein isolate (pea and canola protein) with and without added leucine (PBP and PBP þLeu) on the muscle protein synthetic response in young men and women.Although pea protein isconsidered a relatively higher-quality protein in plant sources, ithas a lower content of methionine [ 17].
On the other hand, canola protein isolate contains a substantial amount ofsulfur-containing AAs (i.e., methionine and cysteine, /C213 g/100 g), which is higher than in any other plant source [ 18]. We compared PBP to whey protein isolate (WHEY; i.e., high-qualityanimal-based protein) in a controlled randomized crossoverdesign in healthy young men and women.We hypothesized that1) ingestion of PBP would increase the MPS rate above the postabsorptive state; 2) the MPS response to PBP þLeu would be greater than that of PBP; and 3) the MPS response to the PBP þLeu would be similar to an equivalent amount of WHEY with an equal leucine content.Methods This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HiREB: 14040) and conducted according to theguidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.All subjects wereinformed about the purpose, experimental procedures, andpossible risks of the study before written informed consent was obtained.
Participants Total 8 healthy and recreationally active young men ( n¼4) and women ( n¼4) were recruited for this study. All participants were between 18 and 30 y old and nonsmokers, had a BMI be-tween 18 and 30 kg/m 2, and had not been involved in any structured resistance exercise program for at least the previous 3mo.Participants who were using corticosteroids, anabolic ste-roids (e.g., testosterone), anti-in ﬂammatory drugs, or hormonal contraceptives and had any gastrointestinal, neurological, orcardiovascular diseases or a history of neuromuscular or muscledisease were excluded.This study was registered at clinicaltrials.govas NCT05139160.Study design This study was a blinded, randomized, double crossover design consisting of 3 study visits.On each study visit, a differentprotein supplement was ingested: WHEY, PBP, or PBP þLeu,which had a leucine content matched to that of the WHEY sup- plement.
The screening visit consisted of measuring height (m),body mass (kg), and body composition (lean mass [kg] and fatmass [kg]) assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry (GE-LunariDXA). The order of treatments, PBP, PBP þLeu, or WHEY, was randomly assigned, and only one of the supplements was pro- vided on each study visit.The randomization treatment order was computer-generated ( http://www.randomization.com ), and all procedures and analyses were performed in a double-blindedmanner.On the study visits, participants underwent a primedconstant infusion of L-[ring- 13C6] phenylalanine and muscle bi- opsies to measure MPS rates and blood draws to evaluatecirculating AA concentrations over 5 h following the ingestion of1 of 3 supplements providing 20 g of protein per study visit.Diet Prior to the ﬁrst study visit, the habitual dietary information of each participant was evaluated using a 3-d dietary log (2weekdays, 1 weekend day).
Participants were instructed to maintain their regular dietary intake and to refrain from any strenuous physical activity or alcohol consumption for 2 d priorto the study visit. The evening prior to each study visit, partici-pants ingested a standardized meal (Heart-to-Home Meal).Afteringestion of the provided standardized meal, participants startedan overnight fast.To ensure the meal was ingested, at the start ofeach study visit, participants were asked if they had ﬁnished the provided standardized meal.Infusion protocol A schematic overview of the study visits is presented in Figure 1 .At the ﬁrst study visit, subjects arrived at the laboratory at 07:30 following an overnight fast.First, a catheter was placed into the antecubital vein, and a heating pad was applied for 10 min prior to each given time to collect arterialized blood duringthe protocol.
After the ﬁrst basal blood collection, a second catheter was inserted in the contralateral arm for the infusion ofL-[ring- 13C6] phenylalanine. After a single intravenous priming dose of L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine (2.0 μmol/kg) was admin- istered ( t¼/C0180 min), the continuous intravenous infusion of L- [ring-13C6] phenylalanine (0.05 μmol/kg/min) was initiated using a calibrated pump (Harvard Apparatus).At /C0120 min, the ﬁrst muscle biopsy sample was collected from the vastus lateralis of a leg using a 5-mm Bergstrom needle, custom-modi ﬁed for manual suction, under local anesthesia (2% lidocaine).Blood samples were taken at /C0120, /C060, and 0 min ( Figure 1 ).Immediately following the collection of the second muscle bi-opsy sample from the same leg at 0 min, subjects ingested 1 of 3protein supplements (i.e., PBP, PBP þLeu, WHEY), randomly assigned.
Satiety and palatability questionnaires were obtainedimmediately following the ingestion of the supplement ( t¼ 0 min) and at later time points ( Figure 1 ). Blood samples were collected at the times indicated in Figure 1 after ingestion of the supplement.Following the collection of the last blood sample ( t ¼300 min), another muscle biopsy was collected.During the second and third study visits, the same procedures were repeated to evaluate the other 2 supplements, except for the ﬁrst muscle biopsy at /C0120 min.Blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged at 1000 /C2gat 4 /C14C for 10 min to obtain plasma.After centrifugation, the aliquots of the plasma were stored in a freezerC.Lim et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 8 (2024) 103769 2 at/C080/C14C until further analysis.Any visible nonmuscle materials (e.g., connective tissue, blood, and fat) were removed from thecollected muscle samples.
The muscle samples were immediatelyfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at /C080 /C14C until further analysis. Protein supplements WHEY (SureProtein WPI 895) was obtained from Fonterra.PBP consisted of 88% pea protein (Peazazz) and 12% canolaprotein (Puratein), which were obtained from Merit FunctionalFood.The PBP þLeu leucine concentration was matched with that of WHEY and was mixed, taste-matched, and packaged byGruppo Nutrition in sachets and shipped to McMaster withoutidentifying marks but numbered.~25 g of the supplements (Table 1 ), which contained 20 g of protein, were dissolved in 350 mL water.The manufacturers provided the AA pro ﬁles of each supplement.The drinks were prepared by a blinded, indepen-dent assistant on the morning of the study visit.On the basis ofphenylalanine content in the supplement, the drinks wereenriched to 4% with L-[ring- 13C6] phenylalanine to minimize disturbances in the isotopic steady state.
Macronutrients and thespeciﬁc AA compositions of the ingested supplements are pre- sented in Table 1 . Plasma analysis AAs were analyzed using the Waters Pico-Tag System (Wa- ters).Blood samples were hydrolyzed, and precolumn derivat-ized using phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spec- trometry.In brief, samples were dried in pyrolyzed borosilicatetubes in a vacuum centrifugal concentrator and subjected tovapor phase hydrolysis by 6 N HCl with 1% phenol at 110 /C14C for 24 h under a prepuri ﬁed nitrogen atmosphere.After hydrolysis, excess HCl was removed by vacuum, and hydrolysates were washed with redrying solution and derivatized with PITC toproduce phenylthiocarbamyl AAs.The derivatization methodwas accomplished at room temperature, derivatized both pri-mary and secondary AAs (i.e., proline and hydroxyproline), andformed very stable AA derivatives detectable at low picomolelevels.
Derivatized AAs were redissolved in phosphate buffer andtransferred to injection vials, which were loaded into the auto-sampler for automatic injection. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined using a commercially available glucose monitor (Contour).In addition, plasma insulin concentrations were measured using a commer- cially available insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO, Human Insulin ELISAKit).Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was determinedfor plasma and insulin concentrations over the protocol using thetrapezoid rule [ 19].Plasma L-[ring- 13C6] phenylalanine enrichments were measured using GC-MS (GC Hewlett Packard 6890; MS Agilent5973) as previously described [ 2].Muscle analysis Muscle protein-bound L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrich- ments in whole muscle tissue (i.e., both sarcoplasm and FIGURE 1.Schematic representation of the experimental protocol during the study visits.

After removing the supernatant, the remaining muscle pellets were washed with70% ethanol and hydrolyzed with 1M HCl in the oven at 110 /C14C for 72 h. The bound protein hydrolysate was passed over acation-exchange column (Dowex 50WX8 –200 resin, Sigma-Aldrich) and converted to their N-acetyl-n-propyl ester derivatives for analysis by GC-C-IRMS.Calculations The MPS rate was calculated using the standard precursor- product method: MPSð%=hÞ¼/C18ΔEm Ep/C2t/C19 /C2100 ΔEmrepresents the change in protein-bound L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrichment between 2 samples.Eprepresents the average plasma-free L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrichmentduring the tracer incorporation period, and tindicates the time interval (in hours) between biopsies.Palatability, hunger, and fullness questionnaire Palatability, appearance, smell, taste, and aftertaste of the supplements were assessed immediately after ingestion of thesupplements using a visual analog scale (VAS) in a double-blinded manner.
The responses to the questionnaires were con-verted to a score of 1 to 10. A higher score represented a morefavorable response.Hunger and fullness were assessed at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 300 min following ingestion of the supplements using VAS.iAUCwas determined for hunger and fullness using the scores (1 –10) converted from VAS; a higher score represented more hunger or more fullness.Statistics A power calculation was performed based on previous research performed with the most similar methodological andintervention protocol as the present study to detect a differencein MPS.In the previous study, the postabsorptive levels of theMPS rate (0.025 %/h /C60.06) were increased to 0.049 %/h /C6 0.02 following ingestion of 25 g whey protein [ 2].
Therefore, with an α¼0.05, β¼0.8, and utilizing a within-participant comparison, 7 participants were determined to be suf ﬁcient to detect a signi ﬁcant difference in the primary outcome (i.e., MPS rate) between baseline and after supplement ingestion. Data was assessed for normality using the Shapiro –Wilk test.Time-dependent variables (i.e., plasma glucose, insulin, AAconcentrations, L-[ring- 13C6] phenylalanine enrichments, and hunger and fullness scores) were analyzed using a 2-wayrepeated measures, within-subject analysis of variance(ANOVA), with time and treatment.MPS and iAUC of plasma glucose, insulin, hunger, and fullness were compared between treatments using a 1-way, within-subject ANOVA.The Tukeypost hoc test was performed following the analysis of the sig-niﬁcant interactions from 2-way ANOVA or differences from 1- way ANOVA.All data are presented as means /C6SD.Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P<0.05.All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.3.2).
Results Participant characteristics A total of 8 (4 men and 4 women) young, healthy adults were recruited for this randomized crossover design study. All par-ticipants completed the study visits for PBP þLeu and WHEY, and 7 participants (4 men and 3 women) completed the study visit for PBP in a blinded manner.The participants ’character- istics are presented in Table 2 .Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations Plasma glucose concentrations were increased at 30 min after protein ingestion with no difference among supplements (inter- action, P¼0.984; treatment, P¼0.166; and time, P<0.001) and returned to basal level by 60 min following protein ingestion(Figure 2 A).There was no difference in iAUC in glucose con- centration over time among protein supplements ( P¼0.683; Figure 2 B).

Plasma concentrations at 15, 30, and 45 min following PBP þLeu ingestion were 60% /C647% ( P¼ 0.011), 108% /C654% ( P<0.001), and 132% /C6127% ( P<0.001) greater than those following PBP ingestion.

MPS rate and plasma L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrichment Compared to postabsorptive MPS levels (0.015 /C60.003%/h), MPS measured over 5 h following ingestion of PBP, PBP þLeu, or WHEY was increased to 0.041 /C60.004, 0.049 /C60.004, or 0.046 /C60.006 %/h, respectively (all, P<0.001; Figure 4 ). There were no differences in MPS between PBP þLeu and WHEY ( P¼ 0.052).However, the increased MPS following ingestion of PBPþLeu and WHEY was greater than that following the ingestion of PBP by 16.2% /C611.6% ( P¼0.002) and 12.1% /C616.1% ( P¼ 0.046), respectively.There was no difference or change in plasma L-[ring- 13C6] phenylalanine enrichment over time (interaction, P¼0.793; treatment, P¼0.145; time, P¼0.244; Supplemental Figure 1 ).The mean plasma L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrichments over time were 6.4 /C60.7, 6.4 /C61.0, and 6.7 /C60.8% (tracer/tracee) for PBP, PBP þLeu, and WHEY, respectively.
Palatability, hunger, and fullness There were no differences in appearance ( P¼0.866), smell ( P ¼0.342), taste ( P¼0.932), aftertaste ( P¼0.824), and palat- ability ( P¼1.0) between PBP, PBP þLeu, and WHEY ( Table 3 ). Hunger and fullness scores over time are shown in Supple- mental Figure 2 .There was no interaction between the effects of time and treatment in scores for hunger (interaction, P¼0.618) and fullness (interaction, P¼0.606).However, the main effect of time was detected in both the hunger score (treatment, P¼ 0.082; time, P<0.001) and fullness score (treatment, P¼0.268; time, P<0.001).There were no differences in iAUC in hunger ( P ¼0.082) and fullness scores ( P¼0.702) over time between protein supplements.Discussion The present study demonstrates that the consumption of PBP þLeu stimulated MPS to a similar extent as WHEY in young men and women.
The ingestion of PBP without added leucine stillincreased MPS above postabsorptive levels but to a lesser extentthan PBP þLeu or WHEY. While statistically different from WHEY and PBP þLeu, the stimulation of MPS by PBP was still relatively robust, considering a numerically small difference inthe MPS compared with WHEY.Compared with animal proteins, plant-based proteins often contain lower amounts of EAAs and may be limited in their abilityto supply adequate EAAs due to lower levels of leucine, lysine, or sulfur-containing AAs [ 8].Combining >2 different sources of plant-based protein could be an effective solution to improve EAAproﬁles by complementing the lower level of one or more AA.In this study, the PBP was a combination of 2 plant-based proteinsources: pea protein isolate, which contains a moderate amount ofleucine and lysine but low amounts of methionine; and canolaprotein isolate, which contains higher amounts of methionine toimprove the EAA pro ﬁle [8].
Consumption of PBP led to an in- crease in plasma EAA concentrations and stimulated MPS abovepostabsorptive levels, which is in line with a previous study con-ducted in our laboratory that showed an increase in MPS following the ingestion of potato protein when compared with fasting MPS [ 20]. However, the increase in MPS following ingestion of PBP was still lower than that following ingestion ofWHEY, but only by 12% /C616%.These results parallel previous studies showing plant-based protein isolates, such as soy or wheat,result in less stimulation of MPS, coincident with lower AAavailability, compared with milk protein [ 6,21].Nonetheless, the difference in MPS between PBP and PBP þLeu and WHEY was numerically small, and the physiological bene ﬁts would, we pro- pose, be dif ﬁcult to establish.Despite no difference in total AA and EAA concentrations when subjects ingested PBP and PBP þLeu, PBP þLeu stimulated MPS more than PBP.
Additionally, PBP þLeu comparably increased MPS to an extent no different than that of WHEY, alongwith a similar elevation in plasma leucine concentration. Thesedata show that when all EAAs are supplied, the leucine content ofthe protein and subsequent leucinemia determines the muscleanabolic response.Several previous studies have already reportedthe role of leucine as an effective anabolic stimulator [ 22,23], and FIGURE 4.Mixed muscle fractional synthesis rate (%/h) following ingestion of the PBP (n ¼7), PBP þLeu, or WHEY in healthy young men and women (n ¼8).Data are expressed as means /C6standard deviation (closed circles, men; open circles, women).1-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA, within-subjects, was used to assess the mixed FSR.Means with different letters are signi ﬁcantly different.

Current Developments in Nutrition 8 (2024) 103769 7 the present study supports the leucine “threshold ”hypothesis of how protein ingestion induces MPS [ 24]. Furthermore, these data are supported by a previous study showing that a plant-basedprotein blend matched in EAA content, particularly leucine, towhey protein reached an equivalent MPS as the whey protein,even though the plasma total EAA concentrations and the plasma leucine concentrations were lower in the plant-based protein group compared with the whey group [ 25].Based on the results not only from the current study but also from previous studies assessing the impact of plant-based protein[16,20,25], it seems that ingesting plant-based proteins is not a limited variable to induce anabolism in skeletal muscle, resultingin similar anabolic response as ingesting animal-based protein,as long as a suf ﬁcient amount of protein and all EAAs are consumed.
However, it should be noted that this study specif-ically focused on young, healthy adults. Thus, older individualswho have a lower anabolic response to protein ingestion may respond differently to plant-based proteins compared to young adults.Although we predict that plant-based proteins with suf-ﬁcient leucine content may induce effective anabolism as an alternative protein source in older adults, further study is neededin older individuals.PBP and the PBP þLeu did not show any differences in palatability, fullness, and hunger compared to WHEY.These dataare in line with the study conducted by Melson et al.[ 26], who showed no differences in hunger, fullness, satiety, desire to eat,and prospective food consumption following the ingestion of aliquid soy-based breakfast and a liquid whey-based breakfast.The current study is the ﬁrst to determine the effect of a PBP on MPS using a within-subject design, which improves statis-tical power and minimizes between-subject variability.
A po-tential limitation of the current study is that we did not directlyanalyze the AA content of the supplements used in the currentstudy and relied on the information provided by the manu-facturer. However, the plasma EAA concentration followingingestion of the supplements was in line with the provided AAproﬁles.Additionally, we used the plasma phenylalanine pool to calculate MPS as a surrogate for the true precursor, theintracellular aminoacyl-tRNA pool, due to the technical dif ﬁ- culty of accurately measuring aminoacyl-tRNA.However, uti- lizing a blood precursor pool to measure MPS has beenvalidated previously [ 27], and plasma and intracellular tracer enrichment, while giving relatively similar MPS trends [ 28].
For future directions, considering individual preference oraccessibility to plant sources, novel combinations of diverseplant sources that generate higher leucine content with allEAAs are required to provide a wide range of plant-basedprotein options and individualized alternatives toanimal-based protein for MPS improvement. Additionally,determining the ef ﬁcacy of PBPs in clinical populations or older adults or conducting longer-term studies investigating the ef- fect of PBPs will provide valuable insights into the applicationof plant-based protein ingestion.We conclude that the ingestion of 20 g of pea and canola protein isolate blend was able to increase MPS above post-absorptive levels but not as effectively as whey protein; how-ever, when leucine content was matched, the pea and canolaprotein isolate blend stimulated MPS to the same degree aswhey protein in healthy young adults.
Thus, the present studyshows the ef ﬁcacy of plant-based protein containing higherleucine content in promoting anabolism as an alternative to animal-based protein.
