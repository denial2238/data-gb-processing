The 4 weeks of storage had a statistically signiﬁcant ( P\0.05) effect on every tested parameter, while the addition of citric acid had a statistically signiﬁ- cant ( P\0.05) effect on pH, conductivity, L *and b* values, protein solubility, emulsion activity index, emul- sion capacity, emulsion stability, and an increase in foaming and texture parameters, but not on rheological parameters. Citric acid addition and a storage period of4 weeks resulted in a change of pH and an increase in protein solubility.It also led to a lower foaming capacity and a larger drainage of the system, which causes a lowerpower (work load) requirement to break formed gels.Apparent viscosity did not change signiﬁcantly in the samples with citric acid.
Keywords Liquid whole eggs /C1Physical properties /C1 Functional properties /C1Citric acid /C1StorageIntroduction Eggs and egg products have an important and irreplaceable role in human nutrition due to high protein content, high bioavailability, valuable nutrients, the diverse range of applications, as well as a relatively low cost and highavailability in most countries. The majority of eggs are consumed as shell eggs, but signiﬁcant amounts are further processed into egg products, speciﬁcally pasteurized liquidwhole eggs (LWE) (Kovacs-Nolan et al.2005 ).LWE are primarily used as a food ingredient (bakery products, meat products, confectioneries, etc.).LWE contribute a highnutritional value and alter the functional properties of foods such as emulsifying, gelling, foaming, colouring and ﬂavouring (Monfort et al.2012 ; Lee 2002 ; Koc et al.2011 ).For this reason, knowledge of the functional properties of LWE is critical.
Pasteurization is the most important processing step for egg products, and has been thoroughly investigated (Monfort et al. 2012 ; Lechevalier et al.2005 ; Mine et al.1990 ).Pasteurisation of LWE assures food safety by eliminating heat sensitive pathogens, but it can also inﬂu- ence egg quality by changing the functional propertiesthrough the denaturation, insolubilization and aggregation of proteins (Lee 2002 ).Egg pasteurisation decreases the foaming ability by denaturing ovotransferrin.The additionof citric and phosphoric acid salts and metallic ions such as Fe, Cu, Al, etc.improves the foaming properties of egg albumen after pasteurisation (Lomakina and Mı ´kova´2006 ).Non-thermal preservation of LWE with pulsed electric ﬁelds (PEF) is an attractive alternative to thermal pas- teurization (Monfort et al.2012 ), along with the incorpo- ration of additives (potassium sorbate and citric acid).
Citric acid is a naturally occurring antioxidant that prevents the green discolouration of egg products and &Nives Marus ˇic´Radovc ˇic´ nmarusic@pbf.hr 1Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, University of Zagreb, Pierottijeva 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia 123J Food Sci Technol (March 2021) 58(3):985–995 https://doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04613-0 lowers pH. Citric acid is widely recognized as a safe (GRAS) additive currently used in a variety of commercial liquid egg products to bind iron and prevent colour loss (greening) during cooking (Schuman and Sheldon 2003 ).Additives such as potassium sorbate and citric acid are commonly used in the production of LWE and other egg products (Lelieveld et al.2007 ).Gongora-Nieto et al.(2003 ) investigated the shelf life of LWE that had been stabilized with 0.15% and 0.5% of citric acid in order to observe its effect on colour darkening, and to increase the effectiveness of pasteurisation treatment.
The authors of the study concluded that LWE with 0.5% citric acidaddition had a shelf life of 26 days. However, they did not investigate how varying concentrations of citric acid could affect the functional properties of LWE.The aim of this work was to examine the inﬂuence of citric acid addition at different concentrations (0, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L) on the physical properties (pH, colour,electrical conductivity, protein solubility and viscosity) and functional properties (foaming, emulsifying, turbidity, texture and particle size distribution) of LWE during4 weeks of storage.Materials and methods Samples of LWE Egg samples were obtained from Lukac ˇLtd.from Zagreb, Croatia.Eggs were pasteurized at 66 /C176C, at a ﬂow rate of 1000 L/h.For research purposes, samples of pasteurized liquid whole egg with three different concentrations of citric acid were prepared: 300, 400 and 500 mg/L.Controlsamples were samples with no added citric acid.
In all samples, preservative potassium sorbate (C 6H7KO 2), in an amount of 2.7 g/L was added. The samples were packagedin sterile bags (Optopack Ltd.) of 1 kg and packed in bag in box packaging (DS Smith Belis ˇc´e, Croatia).Samples were stored during 4 weeks in refrigerated storage at 4 /C176C.Physical properties The pH was determined at 20 /C176C in triplicate with a pH meter (Pye Model 292, Pye Unicam).A reﬂectance spectrophotometer Minolta CM-3500d (Osaka, Japan) was used to measure the colour of LWE samples.The L *(lightness), a*(redness), and b*(yellow- ness) (CIE 1976 ) were measured.Chroma (C*) and hue angle (h) was also measured.The average value for each sample parameter was the mean of 10 determinations.Conductivity were measured using a conductivity-meter(HI-2030-edge, Hanna Instruments), and temperature using an infrared thermometer (PCE-777, PCE Instruments).Protein solubility The protein solubility was measured by method Lowry et al.( 1951 ).
LWE samples were centrifuged at 4 /C176C for 10 min at 10,000 9gin a Rotina 380R Refrigerated Cen- trifuge (Hettich Zentrifugen GmbH, Germany). Super- natant was used for further analysis.In a 10-mL test tube 100lL supernatant, 500 lL of reactant A (Dc Protein Assay Reagent A) and 4 mL of reactant B (Dc Protein Assay Reagent B) was added.Then the tube was shaken vigorously for 30 s.After 15–20 min standing at ambienttemperature, absorbance at 750 nm was measured on Spectrophotometer Helios Beta (Spectronic Unicam, Cambridge, UK).Viscosity determinations Torque measurements were carried out on the model sys- tems using a Rheometric Viscometer (Model RM 180, Rheometric Scientiﬁc, Inc., Piscataway, USA) with the spindle (no.3; ;= 14 mm; l= 21 cm).Shear stress against the increasing shear rates from the lowest value of 0–1290 s -1, as well as downwards, was applied.The volume of the beaker was 36 mL.
The samples were kept in a thermostatically controlled water bath for about 15 minbefore measurements (to obtain temperature of 25 /C176C). Measurements were done in triplicates.Rheometric com- puter program was used to interpret the shear rate versusshear stress.The values for nandkwere obtained from plots of log shear stress versus log shear rate, according to the following equation: logs¼logkþnlogc ð1Þ where sis the shear stress (Pa), kis the consistency coef- ﬁcient (Pa s n),nis the ﬂow behaviour index and cis the shear rate (s-1).Apparent viscosity ( gapp) was calculated at 1290 s-1 using Newtonian law, in addition to linear least square method for regression analysis.s¼gappc ð2Þ Functional properties Foaming propertiesFoaming properties were measured according to the method by Phillips et al.( 1987 ).
100 mL of 15% LWE solution in deionized water was whipped with a beater (Braun Turbo 600 W) at the maximum speed of 12,500 RPM in a 1000 mL graduated glass for 2 min, and thenfoam volume was measured. Foaming capacity (% FC) was calculated using the following equation:986 J Food Sci Technol (March 2021) 58(3):985–995 123 %FC¼ V2/C0V1 ðÞ =V1 ½/C138 /C2 100 ð3Þ where V 1is the initial LWE volume and V 2is the obtained foam volume.The volume of drainage of liquid (V d) was recorded at 10 min, the foam stability was calculated as follows: %drainage ¼Vd=V1/C2100 ð4Þ Emulsifying properties Emulsifying properties were measured according to the method by Zhao et al.( 2007 )a t2 0 /C176C.Fifty (50) mL of 5% LWE solution in deionized water and 50 mL of commer-cial sunﬂower oil were mixed using a iKAT18 basic ultraturrax (IKA, Staufen, Germany) for 5 min in order to prepare oil in water emulsions.
The mixture was divided inthree different plastic tubes and left at room temperature (20/C176C) for 90 min. After that, the volume of the emulsiﬁed layer was measured.The emulsifying capacity (EC) wascalculated using the following equation: %EC¼V E=V1 ðÞ /C2 100 ð5Þ (VEis the volume of the emulsiﬁed layer and V Iis the initial volume of LWE).After that, emulsion stability (ES) was determined: the tubes with 30 mL of previously prepared emulsions were heated at 80 /C176C for 30 min in a thermostatic water bath and immediately cooled to 20 /C176C in ice water.After that, the volume of emulsiﬁed layer was measured and the per- centage of emulsion (% ES) was calculated: %ES¼VE2=VE1 ðÞ /C2 100 ð6Þ (VE2is the volume of the emulsiﬁed layer that remains after heating and V E1is the initial volume of emulsiﬁed layer).TurbidityEmulsions were prepared with 3% m/v protein suspension using sunﬂower oil (Zvijezda d.d, Zagreb, Croatia).
Twenty(20) mL of 3% egg suspension and 10 mL of oil, were mixed for 90 secs in a blender. The absorbance of the diluted emulsions was measured by spectrophotometer(Helios-b, Pye Unicam Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at 500 nm in 1 cm path length cuvettes.The emulsifying activity index (EAI) was determined by the turbidimetric method of (Kres ˇic´et al.2008 ).The absorbance was read initially, after what turbidity (Neph- elometric Turbidity Units, NTU) and EAI were calculatedusing the following formula: T¼ 2:303/C1A Ið7Þwhere T = turbidity, A = absorbance at 500 nm and I = path length of cuvette (m).
The emulsion activity index (EAI) in m2/g1was then calculated as: EAI¼2/C12:303/C1D/C1A I/C1U/C1C/C110000¼2/C1T U/C1Cð8Þ where D = is the dilution factor, A = the absorbance at 500 nm, I = the path length of the cuvette (cm), /= the volumetric fraction of oil; C = the weight of protein perunit volume of aqueous phase before the emulsion was formed (g mL -1) and 10,000 the correction factor for square meters, T = turbidity (calculated from aboveequation). For emulsion stability determination the emulsion was held at 4 /C176C for 24 h and reanalysed for emulsion activity as described previously.An emulsion stability index (min) was calculated by the following formula: ESI¼T/C1Dt DTð9Þ where T = turbidity value at 0 h, DT = change in turbidity during 24 h period, Dt = time interval (24 h).Textural properties of LWE To evaluate textural properties gel of LWE was prepared by heating the suspensions placed in 150 mL glass beaker at 80 /C176C for 15 min in water bath with constant stirring.
After that, the samples were cooled to room temperature byimmersing the beaker in icy water and then kept at 4 /C176C for further analysis. Texture was determined 24 h after the gel preparation.Gel hardness and work applied were determined with a texture analyser (Texture analyser HD ?, Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, UK).The speed of the measuringprobe was 1 mm/s after contact with gel surface and during penetration.Pull out speed of probe was set at 5 mm/s.The measurement depth was 10 mm.Tool used in analysis ofmechanical properties is steel cylindrical probe with 6 mm diameter.Gel hardness was deﬁned as maximal force applied (N) during ﬁrst compression part of the TPA cycle.Work is analysed as surface under force-distance curve.Samples were assayed in triplicate.
Particle size distribution Particle size was determined by laser light scattering (Malvern Mastersizer 2000 equipped with a 100 mm lens, Malvern Instruments Limited, Malvern—Worcestershire,UK with Hydro MU sample dispersion unit). Results were analysed with, Mastersizer 2000 software, using a MieJ Food Sci Technol (March 2021) 58(3):985–995 987 123 scattering model for the analysis of the raw data (Jambrak et al.2014 ).Statistical analysesExperiments were conducted as multifactor categorical design.Descriptive statistics were used to assess the basicinformation about the experimental dataset (e.g.to obtain sample basic metrics, check for normality of distribution, transform the variables if necessary).Variables were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance (MAN- OVA), and marginal means were compared with Bonferonimultiple comparison tests.Linear regression was employed to build and compare mathematical models.
The signiﬁ- cance levels for all tests were P\0.05, while analyses were performed with Statgraphics Centurion software (StatPoint Technologies, Inc, VA, USA). Results and discussion Effect of citric acid addition on pH, conductivity,protein solubility and texture parameters Table 1shows the effect of citric acid addition (300, 400, 500 mg/L) on pH, conductivity, protein solubility and texture parameters of LWE.The pH value is a criticalfactors in maintaining the quality and properties of egg products.The pH value of liquid whole eggs ranges from 7.0 to 7.6, averaging 7.2 (Cotterill and McBee 1995 ).Control LWE’s pH value was constant at 7.6–7.7 during the initial 3 weeks of storage, decreasing to 6.5 after 4 weeks of storage.Samples of LWE with a citric acidaddition had a pH of 7.6–7.9 after 3 weeks and decreased to 6 after 4 weeks.Giampietro-Ganeco et al.( 2012 ) found that storage at lower temperatures is a more effective wayto maintain egg quality characteristics.Re ˆgo et al.
( 2012 ) found that the pH value of commercially pasteurized eggs decreases after 2 weeks of storage. Alleoni and Antunes(2001 ) investigation showed the pH value of the eggs stored at 5 /C176C for 3 weeks ranged from 7.6 to 7.9, con- curring with the results of this study.Microbiologicalanalysis of LWE was continuously performed during storage (data not shown), ensuring that the LWE retained microbiological safety.The level of conductivity determines many of the internal properties of treated food.The results in Table 1 show that after 3 weeks of storage all samples had anelectrical conductivity above 5 mS/cm, with the highest electrical conductivity value was 6.38 mS/cm found in samples with 500 mg/L citric acid.More acidic sampleshad a higher conductivity: samples with the highest con- centration of citric acid had the highest electricalconductivity after 3 weeks of storage.Malek et al.
( 2006 ) investigated the relationship between LWE and fruit juice conductivity, ﬁnding that LWE had higher conductivity. Compared with fruit juices, the value of conductivity ofLWE was higher due to the large amounts of salt and acid concentration acting as electrolytes, conducting electricity (Halden et al.1990 ).Studies have shown that the con- ductivity of a liquid inﬂuences the nature of the ion (chemical composition) and ionic ﬂuid movement (Pala- niappan and Sastry 1991 ).The protein solubility of the control sample (sample with no citric acid) lowers with increased storage time.Theprotein solubility dropped 17.13% from 113.2 to 93.4%, between the ﬁrst and second week of storage after which it remained stable until the 4th week of storage.
The reduc-tion in protein solubility of LWE was caused by the denaturation of the proteins and by the destruction of their tertiary and quaternary structures, intensifying the aggre-gation reactions between them and consequently reduces their solubility (Yang and Baldwin 1995 ; Wang and Tu 2008 ). The addition of 300 mg/L citric acid showed a positive effect on protein solubility.The concentration of protein solubility after 7 days of storage was 113.2 mg/mL and decreased 0.24% by further storage.However, theaddition of citric acid in concentrations of 400 and 500 mg/ L did not have the same effect.With the addition of 400 mg/L, the solubility was reduced by 3.40% from theﬁrst to the second week of storage (from 110.5 to 106.77 mg/mL) and by 12.68% in the remaining 2 weeks (from 110.5 to 96.5 mg/mL).
Better protein solubility wasobtained with the addition of 500 mg/L citric acid, where the protein solubility decreased by 2.04% from the 1st week (108.7 mg/mL) to the end of the storage time(106.5 mg/mL). From these results, it can be concluded that the addition of 300 mg/L citric acid caused a mild pH change during the 4 weeks of storage and had a positiveeffect on the preservation of protein solubility.The addi- tion of citric acid, time in storage (weeks of storage) and interaction between those two factors had a statisticallysigniﬁcant increase in protein solubility (Tables 1and2).Table 1shows the effect of citric acid addition on tex- ture parameters (hardness and work) during 4 weeks ofstorage.Signiﬁcant differences ( P\0.05) were found when comparing samples with citric acid addition with control samples (Table 2).Hardness (N) considered one of the most important parameters tested is one of the few properties than can also be observed through sensory analysis.
Gelling capacity is a functional property essentialto obtain viscoelastic gels which act as a food thickener and binder, and for stabilizing emulsions and foams. Gel for- mation involves protein denaturation and aggregation.Some of the factors affecting gel hardness are: temperature, time of heating and pH increase.Denaturalized protein988 J Food Sci Technol (March 2021) 58(3):985–995 123 augments and becomes available for incorporation into the gel network, increasing gel hardness (Monfort et al.2012 ).The control samples showed higher gel hardness after the 1st, 3rd and 4th weeks of storage.The sample with 300 mg/L of citric acid had the highest hardness after3 weeks.In the 400 mg/L sample storage gel hardness increased and peaked after 3 weeks, then decreased reaching its minimum after the 4th week of storage.Tunick et al.( 1991 ) investigated the hardness property of LWE throughout storage time and found that higher hardnessvalues may be caused by low humidity.
The highest work value was found in the control samples after the 3rd week of storage, while the lowest work value was found in the400 mg/L citric acid sample after the 4th week of storage. Similar with gel hardness: the highest gel hardness was found in the control samples, while the lowest was found inthe 400 mg/L citric acid samples.Tokus ¸og˘lu and Barbosa- Ca´novas ( 2018 ) found that pH reduction decreased the hardness of prepared egg gels explaing the lower hardnessand work in this study, showing samples with citric acid addition had lower hardness and work values than controlsamples.The LWE gel in this study became signiﬁcantly harder with increased storage time, especially from second to third week of storage.After 4 weeks of storage thehardness is decreased probably due to structural changes in LWE.Slight changes in pH caused slight changes in charge on the protein molecule, resulting in slightly less water uptake on protein molecules.
Also during the formation of gels an increase in temperature causes formation of ther-mally induced disulphide bonds. The charges measured as the conductivity, are also slightly increased after the 4th week of storage (Nakano et al.2018 ).Effect of citric acid addition on colour parameters of LWE In Table 3the colour parameters (L *,a*,b*,C*and h) are shown.

The results in Table 2shows a statis- tically signiﬁcant inﬂuence ( P\0.05) of the main factors (addition of citric acid and week of storage) on L*and b* values, while a*value was affected only by 4-week storage period. Interactions between the main factors did not inﬂuence L*,a*,b*values.Citric acid addition affected the L*value of LWE resulting in a lighter colouring in contrast with control samples during the 4 weeks of storage.The L* value of all LWE samples decreased from the 1st week tothe 2nd week, after which it showed a gradual increaseduring the 3rd and 4th weeks of storage.The a *,b*and C* value showed a similar pattern.Citric acid addition did not have an effect on the a* value, which decreased from ﬁrst to second week of storageindicating diminution in redness of the sample.After3 weeks of storage the a *value ﬁrst increased and then decreased after the fourth week of storage.
At the end of the storage period control sample a*had higher values in comparison with samples with citric acid addition. The increase in a*value could be explained by the formation of Fe-conalbumin complex.The conalbumin yields a redcolour when it forms a complex with Fe 3?ions.The egg white in which conalbumin is suspended contains no Fe3?ions, but the Fe3?ions can be supplied from the egg yolk during the preparation of LWE (Tokus ¸og˘lu and Barbosa- Ca´novas 2018 ).The yellow colour of LWE indicated by b* value, is contributed by the pigments in egg yolk such as xanthophyll, lutein and zeaxanthin (Lee 2002 ).b*value increases signiﬁcantly ( P\0.05) from second to fourthweek of storage and shows an increase in yellow colour in samples with citric acid addition in contrast with controlsamples.The highest b *value was found in the 400 mg/L citric acid samples, while the lowest were in the control samples.Parameter C*refers to the colour tone.
The highest C*value was found in the 300 mg/L citric acid samples after the 4th week of storage, while the lowest was found in the control sample after the 2nd week of storage.Parameter h refers to the saturation of colour; a lower value means a lighter colour. The lowest saturation value was found in the 400 mg/L citric acid samples after the 3rdweek of storage and the highest was found in the 500 mg/L citric acid samples after the 4th week of storage.The colour of LWE depends on the physical and chemical properties of the egg components.Colour chan- ges observed in this study are due to a variation of the pHwhich is affected by addition of different concentration of citric acid which acted as a colour stabilizer.Su and Lin (1993 ) found that protein denaturation which occurs due to thermal coagulation, explains the main colour changes that occurred in treated LWE samples.

The 300 mg/L sample showed anincrease in the foaming capacity after 3 weeks of storage. This is caused by the interaction between citric acid and the proteins in LWE causing better incorporation of air.It can also be explained by the increased propagation of proteins through the air–liquid interface (Jambrak et al.2008 ).Higher concentrations of citric acid and lengthened storage times cause a change in pH and an increase in protein solubility.They also lead to a lower foaming capacity andan increase in drainage of the system, causing a lower required power (work load) to break formed gels.The addition of citric acid slightly changes the pH value.Atnear-alkaline pH levels protein molecules have negative net charges (COO -) on their surfaces and repulsion between them increases.This decreases the protein–proteininteractions and increases the protein–water interactions (Foegeding et al.2006 ).Emulsion capacity is stable during the ﬁrst 3 weeks of storage and increases afterwards.
Thesamples with citric acid have higher emulsion stability after 3 weeks of storage than the control samples. The 300 mg/L sampled showed a signiﬁcant effect on the emulsion activity index after 2 weeks of storage compared to thecontrol samples.This is caused by the ability of egg pro- teins to stabilise a higher surface area (after heating) and act as an emulsiﬁer (O’Sullivan et al.2016 ), however the initial emulsion capacity is lower.Turbidity (0 h) decreases with the addition of citric acid and after 4 weeks of storage.Effect of citric acid addition on viscosity of LWE Table 5shows the rheological values of the citric acid and control LWE samples.Rheological values were determined by the Ostwald-de Waele law since the coefﬁcient ofregression was exceptionally high (from 0.995 to 0.999).All samples were evaluated according to the ﬂow indexes obtained in time independent non-Newtonian liquids,where the LWE exhibit a dilatant character because their ﬂow behaviour index is n [1.
The results are in accor- dance with other studies (RaDva ´nyi et al. 2012 ).

This type of behaviour is rarer thanpseudoplastic (Jambrak et al. 2008 ).On the other hand a study by Scalzo et al.( 1970 ) showed ﬂow index (n) values of liquid whole eggs range from 0.929 to 0.988, whichindicates that LWE exhibits pseudoplastic character (n\1).The consistency coefﬁcient and ﬂow behaviourindex for control samples were highest after 2 weeks of storage.Table 2shows a statistically signiﬁcant inﬂuence of weeks of storage on rheological values.The citric acidsamples show a larger decrease in the consistency coefﬁ- cient and ﬂow behaviour index values compared to the control samples.The largest decrease was found in thesample with the highest citric acid concentration, 500 mg/ L.

The lowest apparent viscosity of 0.010 mPa s at 1290 s-1was found in the control samples after 4 weeks of storage, while the highest value(0.013 mPa s) was found in the control samples after 1 week of storage. Samples with 300, 400 and 500 mg/L of citric acid showed no signiﬁcant change ( P[0.05) in the apparent viscosity value.The consistency coefﬁcient varied from 1.678 to 2.483 (Pa s n).Singh et al.( 2011 ) investi- gated LWE stored at room temperature and at 6 /C176C.LWE at room temperature showed more pseudoplastic charac- teristics after storage time elapsed than samples stored at 6/C176C.That is concluded based on the decrease of ﬂow behaviour index in investigated samples.In all samples the R value was above 0.99.The highest rheological consis- tency coefﬁcient was found in the control samples after the2 weeks of storage and the lowest value was found in the samples with 500 mg/L citric acid at the beginning of storage.
Increasing viscosity with an increase in shear ratecharacterizes the dilatant ﬂuid. Effect of citric acid addition on particle size of LWEThe particle size distribution in LWE samples was anal- ysed in order to determine the particle size changes and thepossible existence of agglomerates which further inﬂuence the properties of LWE.The particle size is reduced by the free surface effect of the LWE samples.In this case, theparticle size is reduced due to protein denaturation result- ing from egg pasteurization (Jambrak et al.2008 ).Table 6 shows the results of the particle size distribution, speciﬁcsurface area, mean surface value, mean volume value of the control (C) and treated samples (300, 400, 500 mg/L) of citric acid during the 4 weeks of storage.The particle sizedid not change signiﬁcantly ( P[0.05) in any sample during the 1st week of storage.The mean volume value in the control sample was 3.3 and the lowest value (0.75) wasfound in the 300 mg/L samples.
This indicates that the particle volume decreased the most with the lowest con- centration of citric acid. The most common mean valuewas observed when using laser diffraction is the volume mean or D4.3.The D4.3 is very sensitive to the presence of large particles in the distribution.The addition of citric acidﬁrstly affects large aggregates formed.Therefore, slight addition of citric acid with agitation and mixing procedure has an impact in reducing aggregates in the samples.Afterthe 2nd week of storage, the speciﬁc surface area and mean surface area did not show any difference in any sample.The particle size did not change signiﬁcantly in any sam-ples during 4 weeks of storage.The mean volume of the control sample was 10.65 while the lowest value (0.62) was found in the 500 mg/L sample.The particle volumedecreased the most in the sample with the highest con- centration of citric acid.

The mean volume was highest in the controlsample (1.63) and lowest in the 400 mg/L citric acid sample (0.89). Conclusion The addition of 300 mg/L of citric acid caused a mild pHchange and had a positive effect on the preservation of protein solubility in LWE throughout the 4-week storageperiod.The storage time had a statistically signiﬁcant (P\0.05) effect on every tested parameter, including pH, conductivity, L *,a*and b*values of colour, protein solu- bility, emulsion activity index, emulsion capacity, emul- sion stability, foaming, ﬂow behaviour index, consistency coefﬁcient, foaming and texture parameters.The additionof citric acid had a statistically signiﬁcant ( P\0.05) effect on pH, conductivity, L*and b*values of colour, protein solubility, emulsion activity index, emulsion capacity, emulsion stability, foaming and texture parameters, but not on rheological parameters.Higher amounts of citric acidcause greater changes in pH and larger increases in protein solubility.
It also led to a lower foaming capacity and increased system drainage, which caused a lower power(work load) requirement to break formed gels. The lowest apparent viscosity of 0.010 mPa s at 1290 s -1was found in the control samples after 4 weeks of storage, while thehighest value (0.013 mPa s) was found in the control samples after 1 week of storage.
Samples with 300, 400 and 500 mg/L of citric acid showed no signiﬁcant differ-ence ( P[0.05) in the apparent viscosity value.Table 6 Particle size distribution, speciﬁc surface area, mean surface value and mean volume value of the control (C) and treated samples (300, 400, 500 mg/L) of citric acid during 4 weeks of storage Samples speciﬁc surface area (m2/g)10% less than*50%less than**90% less than***Mean surface value D [3.2]Mean volume value D [4.3] 1 week particle size (lm) K 38.25 ±0.23a0.08±0.01a0.19±0.01a1.38±0.01a0.16±0.01a3.30±0.01a 300 37.75 ±0.21a0.08±0.01a0.19±0.01a1.36±0.01a0.16±0.01a0.75±0.01c 400 39.25 ±0.08a0.07±0.01a0.18±0.01a1.41±0.01a0.15±0.01a0.92±0.01c 500 37.00 ±0.07a0.08±0.01a0.19±0.01a1.71±0.01a0.16±0.01a1.23±0.01b 2 week particle size (lm) K 36.40 ±0.17a0.08±0.01a0.20±0.01a1.74±0.01a0.17±0.01a6.40±0.12b 300 37.70 ±0.14a0.08±0.01a0.19±0.01a1.39±0.01a0.16±0.01a0.77±0.01c 400 38.75 ±0.15a0.07±0.01a0.18±0.01a1.28±0.01a0.16±0.01a0.57±0.01c 500 35.85 ±0.13a0.08±0.01a0.20±0.01a1.64±0.01a0.17±0.01a2.80±0.14a 3 week particle size (lm) K 32.45 ±0.15a0.08±0.01a0.24±0.01a1.77±0.01a0.19±0.01a10.65 ±0.35c 300 33.95 ±0.16a0.08±0.01a0.22±0.01a1.82±0.01a0.18±0.01a5.30±0.01b 400 35.00 ±0.16a0.08±0.01a0.21±0.01a1.61±0.01a0.17±0.01a5.16±0.01b 500 38.75 ±0.17a0.08±0.01a0.18±0.01a1.24±0.01a0.15±0.01a0.62±0.01a 4 week particle size (lm) K 28.50 ±0.21b0.09±0.01a0.37±0.01b2.59±0.01b0.21±0.01b1.63±0.01c 300 29.50 ±0.18b0.09±0.01a0.31±0.01b2.11±0.01b0.20±0.01b1.22±0.01c 400 31.10 ±0.19b0.08±0.01a0.27±0.01b1.73±0.01a0.19±0.01b0.89±0.01b 500 29.55 ±0.18b0.09±0.01a0.31±0.01b1.99±0.01a0.20±0.01b1.24±0.01c *Using Mie’s theory it is determined that 10% particles have diameter less that stated **Using Mie’s theory it is determined that 50% particles have diameter less that stated ***Using Mie’s theory it is determined that 90% particles have diameter less that stated ***Different lettersa-c(for each parameter) in same column represents statistically signiﬁcant difference ( P\0.05)994 J Food Sci Technol (March 2021) 58(3):985–995 123 References Alleoni ACS, Antunes AJ (2001) Unidade Haugh como medida da qualidade de ovos de galinha armazenados sob refrigerac ¸a˜o.
