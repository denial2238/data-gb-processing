The combination of Eucommia ulmoides andTribulus terrestris (ET) has been widely utilized in clinical practice for thousands of years, but the mechanism underlying its eﬃ cacy has not been elucidated to date.This study attempted to investigate the role played by the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism in the response of elderly spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) to ET administration as a treatment for hypertension.Fourteen male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, 18 months old) were randomly divided into an ET group and an SHR group, and 7 Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats of the same age were employed as the control group.
The ET group was intragastrically administered 1.0 g/kg/d ET for 42 days, and SHRs and WKY rats wereadministered an equal amount of normal saline intragastrically. The intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism were analyzedby 16S rRNA sequencing and the GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)/MS assay.ET treatment decreased bloodpressure steadily, improved the colonic tissue morphology, and changed the structure and composition of the imbalanced microbiota in SHRs.Speci ﬁcally, ET treatment increased the abundance of Eubacterium , which might be one of the target microbes for ET, and had a negative correlation with the levels of α-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid according to the Spearman correlation analysis.The change in the intestinal microbiota a ﬀected the fecal metabolic pattern of SHRs.
Eight potential biomarkers were determined to be primarily enriched in ABC transporters, phenylalanine metabolism, central carbon metabolism in cancer, purine metabolism, and protein digestion and absorption. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the abundance of Eubacterium and the decreased levels of α-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid in the ET group were highly correlated.Our results suggest that ET has a good antihypertensive eﬀ ect, which may be driven by the intestinal microbiota and their bene ﬁcial metabolites.The results of this study may help to elucidate the antihypertensive mechanism of ET.1.Introduction Accumulating evidence indicates that there is a close rela- tionship between the intestinal microbiota and hyperten- sion.The intestinal microbiome, which is considered the second human genome [1, 2], is believed to be closelyrelated to chronic diseases, especially the occurrence anddevelopment of hypertension [3 –6].
The overall balance inthe composition of the intestinal microbiota is a key factorensuring normal host functions [7, 8]. It has been suggestedthat the presence or absence of certain speci ﬁc groups of intestinal microbiota contributes to immunity [9], nerve conduction [10], and energy supply [11].Hypertension and imbalances of the intestinal microbiota in ﬂuence each other, and the hypertensive phenotype can be “transferred ” by fecal microbiota transplantation.The relationshipHindawi BioMed Research International Volume 2020, Article ID 4261485, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4261485 between the intestinal microbiota and hypertension treat- ment merits further research.Eucommia ulmoides , the bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., has the Chinese name Duzhong and the English name Eucommiae Cortex.The use of this bark has been recordedfor thousands of years, and it is used to improve generalhealth in traditional Chinese medicine.
Pharmacologicalstudies showed that aqueous and alcohol-based extracts ofEucommia ulmoides had the actions of lowering blood pres- sure and promoting bone-healing, antiaging, and vasodila-tory e ﬀects. Tribulus terrestris has the Chinese name Cijili and the English name Puncturevine Caltrop Fruit.This plantgrows widely in subtropical regions and is generally utilizedto treat hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and aging.Our previ-ous studies indicated that Tribulus terrestris decreases the generation of reactive oxygen species while increasing theconcentration of NOS and improving the metabolism ofendothelial cells [12].The combination of Eucommia ulmoides and Tribulus terrestris (ET) has been widely employed in clinical practice in traditional Chinese medicine.As one of the combination drugs for the treatment of hyper- tension (patent number: CN201810790515.4), ET exhibited good e ﬃcacy against age-related hypertension in previous studies [13, 14].
In this study, we investigated the e ﬀects of ET on the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites. We sequenced the16S rRNA V4 region in the intestinal microbiota and per-formed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)on fecal metabolites and integratively analyzed their correla-tion to explore the potential mechanism underlying theantihypertensive e ﬀects of ET.2.Methods 2.1.Preparation of ET.Formula particles of Eucommia ulmoides andTribulus terrestris (Tianjiang Phar, Eucommia ulmoides formula granules: No.1609169, 1 g/package; Tribu- lus terrestris formula granules: No.1502063, 0.5 g/package, Jiangyin, China) were purchased from the A ﬃliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.The formula particles were dissolved with ultrapure waterto a concentration of 1.63 g raw herbs/ml ( i.e.,0:81 g Eucom mia ulmoides +0 :81 g Tribulus terrestris /ml).2.2.In Vivo Drug Administration.
The study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Ethics Commit-tee for Animal Research ( No. AF/SC-08/02.0), A ﬃliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional ChineseMedicine (Jinan, China).All e ﬀorts were made to alleviate the pain of experimental animals.All animals and experimen-tal procedures in this study were performed in keeping withthe Regulations on the Management of Experimental Animalsof People ’s Republic of China (revised version March 1, 2017).Fourteen male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, 18months old) and 7 WKY rats of the same age were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd.(certi ﬁcate: SCXK (Jing) 2016-0011).The rats were main- tained under the conditions of constant temperature (20-22 °C), constant humidity (50-60%), and ﬁxed light and darkalternation (12 h/12 h).
All rats had access to Cobalt 60-sterilized fodder (Vital River Laboratory Animal TechnologyCo., Ltd., Beijing, China) and ultrapure water ad libitum . After a 5-day adaptive feeding, SHRs were randomly divided intothe ET group and the SHR group.SHRs in the ET group weregiven 1.0 g/kg/d ET suspension ( i.e.,0:5gEucommia ulmoid es+0 :5gTribulus terrestris /kg/d) intragastrically, which was equivalent to 0:5 g/kg/d Eucommia ulmoides +0 :5 g/kg/ dTribulus terrestris in human clinical application, for 6 weeks.The WKY rats and SHRs were administered the samevolume of normal saline.2.3.Blood Pressure Measurement and Sample Collection.Body weight was recorded weekly.Blood pressure was measured weekly in conscious rats by a tail-cu ﬀmethod (MRBP-10, IITC Life Science, USA).Rats were allowed to adapt to thepressure measurement environment for 1 week before formal recording.Rats were placed in the ALC-HTP animal system in quiet and awake states.
The systolic pressure and heart rate ofthe rats were measured. The average of 5 measurements wasrecorded in parallel with an interval of 1 min.Stool sampleswere collected by pinching the tail to let rats defecate understress and collected from the anus to a sterile centrifuge tubedirectly.All samples were stored at -80 °C.2.4.HE Staining.The colons were removed on ice and ﬁxed in neutral paraformaldehyde for 48 h.The colon tissues wereembedded in para ﬃn, sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm, stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), and sealed withneutral balsam.The slides were observed and photographedunder a light microscope.2.5.Intestinal Microbiota Analysis.Sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed by Novogene Technology Co., Ltd.(Beijing, China, Project No.p101sc17020776-01-s1-3-2).2.5.1.DNA Extraction and PCR Ampli ﬁcation.DNA concentra- tion and purity were determined on 1% agarose gels.The DNA concentration was adjusted to 1 ng/ μl.
The V4 region within the 16S rRNA gene was ampli ﬁed using speci ﬁc primers. The primer sequences were 5 ′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 ′ /5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3 ′.PCR products were conﬁrmed with 2% agarose gel electrophoretic analysis, and samples with bright and distinct bands between 400 and450 bp were extracted and puri ﬁed with a Qiagen Gel Extrac- tion Kit (Qiagen, Germany).2.5.2.Library Construction and Sequencing.Sequencing libraries were generated using the TruSeq® DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) following the manu- facturer ’s recommendations.The library quality was assessed on the Qubit@ 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scienti ﬁc, United States) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.Finally, thelibrary was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform,and 250 bp paired-end reads were generated.2.5.3.Data Processing and Analysis.Paired-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and were truncated by cutting o ﬀthe barcode and primer sequence.
For sequence assembly, paired-end reads were merged using2 BioMed Research International FLASH (V1.2.7). High-quality clean tags were utilized according to the QIIME (V1.7.0) quality-controlled process.The tags were compared with the reference database (Golddatabase) using the UCHIME algorithm (UCHIME Algo-rithm) to detect and remove chimeric sequences.Next, theeﬀective tags were obtained.Sequence analysis was performed by Uparse software (Uparse v7.0.1001).Sequences with ≥97% similarity were assigned to the same OTUs.For each represen-tative sequence, Green Gene Database 3 was used based on the RDP classi ﬁer (version 2.2) algorithm to annotate taxonomic information.Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE software (version 3.8.31).Alpha diversity was analyzed by PD-whole tree and observed species.Beta diversity was manifested as PCoAand NMDS analysis.LEfSe analysis was employed to com-pare species with signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences among groups.
The Spearman correlation coeﬃ cient was calculated to determine the potential correlation between the intestinal microbiotaand metabolites. 2.6.Fecal Metabolite Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Analysis.The GC-MS assay was per- formed by OE Biotech Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China, ProjectNo.QDOE2017s907).2.6.1.GC Conditions.A DB-5MS fused-silica capillary column ( 30 m × 0 :25 mm × 0 :25μm, Agilent J&W Scienti ﬁc, Folsom, CA, USA) was utilized to separate the derivatives at a constant ﬂow of 1 ml/min helium.One microliter of sam- ple was injected in split mode at a 20 : 1 split ratio by the auto-sampler.The injection temperature was 280 °C, the interface was set to 150°C, and the ion source was adjusted to 230°C.The temperature rise program was followed by an initialtemperature of 60 °C for 2 min, a 10°C/min rate up to 300°C, and a temperature of 300°C for 5 min.2.6.2.MS Conditions.Mass spectrometry was performed using the full-scan method with a range of 35 to 750 ( m/z).
2.6.3. Data Processing and Analysis.Base File Converter soft- ware was used to convert the raw data to.abf format, and then,the.abf data were imported into the MD-DIAL software fordata processing.Metabolites were annotated using the LUGdatabase (untargeted database of GC-MS from Lumingbio).Partial least square analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partialleast square analysis (OPLS-DA) were utilized to distinguishthe overall di ﬀerences in metabolic pro ﬁles among groups and to identify the di ﬀerent metabolites.Student ’st-test and fold change analysis were employed to compare the di ﬀerent metabolites between the two groups, where metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and pvalues less than 0.05 were considered to be di ﬀerential metabolites.The KEGG database was employed to analyze metabolic pathway enrichment.2.7.Statistical Analysis.Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0.The values are presented as the means ± standard deviation .
Unless otherwise stated, statistical com- parisons were performed using a single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the LSD test. In this study,pvalues less than 0.05 were considered to be signi ﬁcantlydiﬀerent.The Pearson correlation coeﬃ cient was utilized in the correlation analysis between the intestinal microbiotaand fecal metabolites.3.Results 3.1.Blood Pressure and Morphology of Colon Tissues.Before treatment, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the ETgroup was not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from that of the SHR group ( p>0 :05).After 6 weeks of treatment, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the ET group were signi ﬁ- cantly lower than those in the SHR group ( p<0 :05) (Figure 1(a)).As shown in Figure 1(b), intestinal mucosalinjury was signi ﬁcantly more severe in the SHR group than in the WKY group, whereas ET treatment clearly improvedthis pathological manifestation of colon tissues in SHRs.3.2.
ET Changes the Diversity of Intestinal Microbiota in SHR Rats. We employed α-diversity and β-diversity to describe the intra- and intergroup di ﬀerences of microbiota.The results of PD-whole tree and observed species analysis ( α-diversity) showed that both the abundance and diversity of the intestinalmicrobiota among the three groups could be ranked asfollows: WKY > ET > SHRs (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).β-Diversity was described by a linear model (PCoA anal- ysis) and a nonlinear model (NMDS analysis).Both PCoAanalysis and NMDS analysis showed that there were di ﬀerent clusters among the three groups, suggesting signi ﬁcant com- munity di ﬀerences (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)).Overall, the SHR, WKY and ET groups shared 1053 common species, while the ET group had 44 unique speciesand the SHR group had 63 unique species (Figure 2(e)).3.3.Screening of Potential Intestinal Microbiota Biomarkers.We conducted LEfSe analysis to screen the potential biomarkers of groups.
The results showed that the potential biomarkers of the WKY group were Ruminococcus-1 ,Prevo- tella-9 ,Faecalibaculum ,Bacteroides ,Acetitomaculum ,Rose- buria ,a n d Acinetobacter . The potential biomarkers of the SHR group were Biﬁdobacterium ,Butyrivibrio ,Catenisphaera , and Eubacterium_ruminantium_group .Turicibacter ,Rom- boutsia ,Lactobacillus ,Ruminococcaceae_UCG_014 ,Strepto- coccus ,Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_003 ,a n d Terrisporobacter were the potential biomarkers of the ET group (Figure 3).3.4.Identi ﬁcation of Metabolites.We screened di ﬀerential metabolites by determining VIP > 1 ,FC > 2 :0,o rFC < 0 :5 and pvalues <0.05 (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).Ultimately, 8 potential biomarkers were identi ﬁed that may be associated with reduced blood pressure (Table 1).A heat map of di ﬀer- ential metabolites suggested that the metabolic patterns andmetabolic function of WKY rats and SHRs were di ﬀerent and that ET treatment a ﬀected them (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)).3.4.1.
Metabolic Pathway Analysis. To explore the metabolic function of the metabolites, we ran the Metaboanalystpathway analysis module with Metaboanalyst software.The results of this analysis showed that ABC transporters, phe- nylalanine metabolism, central carbon metabolism in cancer,purine metabolism, protein digestion and absorption,3 BioMed Research International mineral absorption, taste transduction, renal cell carcinoma, fatty acid biosynthesis, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesiswere the top 10 enrichment and topological pathways(Figure 5).3.5.Correlation between Potential Biomarkers and Di ﬀerent Microbiota.The correlation of potential biomarkers of meta- bolomics and intestinal microbiota was analyzed by the Spearman correlation coe ﬃcient, since intestinal microbiota regulate the metabolic function of the host [15].
Acinetobacter had a positive correlation with the metabolic level of (s)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid, 2-hydroxybutyricacid, 6-deoxyglucose, chenod eoxycholic acid , deoxycholic acid, D-fructose, and D-fructose-6-phosphate and a nega-tive correlation with 1-monostearin, 2-desoxy-pentos-3- ulose, 2-piperideinobenzonitrile, and 4 ′,5-dihydroxy-7- glucosyloxy ﬂavanone.
Erysipelotrichaceae had a positive correlation with the metabolic level of 1-monostearin and 4 ′,5-dihydroxy-7- glucosyloxy ﬂavanone and a negative correlation with 1- hexacosanol, 3,6-anhydro-D-hexose, 5-alpha-cholestanol, alpha-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid,and D-fructose-1-phosphate and D-fructose-6-phosphate.Unidenti ﬁed_Lachnospiraceae had a positive correlation with the metabolic level of 1-monostearin and 2-piperidinobenzonitrile and a negative correlation with 1-hexacosanol, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3,6-anhydro-D-hexose,4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid, 5-alpha-cholestanol, cheno-deoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, D-fructose, D-fructose-1-phosphate, and D-fructose-6-phosphate (Figure 6). 4.Discussion ET administration demonstrated bene ﬁcial eﬀects on blood pressure and increased the diversity of the intestinal microbi-ota and intestinal mucosal integrity.
Correlation analysissuggested that the intestinal microbiota regulated greaterquantities of metabolites in certain metabolic pathways,thereby reducing blood pressure. Several reports supported the prediction potential of the intestinal microbiota in hypertension [16].The pathologicalprocess of hypertension clearly damages the diversity of intestinal microbiota, while imbalances in the intestinal microbiota contribute to the development of hypertension[17].In our study, the diversity of the intestinal microbiotain WKY rats was signi ﬁcantly higher than that in SHR rats.Pre-treatment 2 weeks 4 weeks 6 weeks050100150SBP (mmHg)200 SHRs ETWKY250⁎ ⁎ Pre-treatment 2 weeks 4 weeks 6 weeks050100150DBP (mmHg)⁎ ⁎ (a) WKY SHRs ET (b) Figure 1: Blood pressure and colon tissue morphology.(a) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels after 6 weeks of ET administration (mmHg).∗p<0 :05vs.WKY rats.SBP: systolic blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure.

However, we noticed that ET administration did not restore the diversity of the intestinal microbiota to normal levels, which may be attributable to the long-lasting pathologicalprocess of hypertension.Butyrivibrio is an important butyric acid-producing genus.Damage to the colonic epithelium is widespreadunder the condition of hypertension [18], while butyric acid is an important fuel for repairing the colonic epithelium.

(e) The Venn diagram shows the common and di ﬀerent intestinal microbiota of the three groups.5 BioMed Research International antihypertensive drugs in clinical studies, which suggests that Streptococcus responds to changes in blood pressure (even after blood pressure control) [19]. Lactobacillus is a microorganism to which antihypertensive e ﬀects have been attributed [20].In the present study, the relative abundancesofStreptococcus and Lactobacillus were signi ﬁcantly increased after ET administration, which supports the e ﬃ- cacy of ET in lowering blood pressure.Treatment with α-tocopherol at a moderate level has been indicated to have an anti-in ﬂammatory e ﬀect.However, treatment with excessive quantities of α-tocopherol increased the risk of mortality in humans according to a meta-analysis[21].
A study also showed that alpha-tocopherol a ﬀected the level of renal (Na +/K+) ATPase in a dose-dependent manner, and the altered Na+/K+ ratio is related to hypertension [21].Chenodeoxycholic acid was considered a natural ligand ofthe farnesoid X receptor in alleviating elevated blood pres-sure in spontaneously hypertensive rats [22]. The activities of 7 α-dehydroxylated enzyme and 7 β-dehydroxylated enzyme, which both participate in the process of bile acid conversion to deoxycholic acid and other secondary metabo-lites, are completely involved in the intestinal microbiota[23].Notably, the related metabolism and transformationof chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid in bile metab-olism were driven by the intestinal microbiota.Kynurenine, atryptophan metabolite in the gastrointestinal tract, wassigniﬁcantly increased in SHRs or in hypertensive patients [24].
Kynurenine is derived from the indoleamine 2,3-dioxy- genase pathway, which is regulated by the intestinal microbi- ota [25]. Enterolactone was the metabolite of linseed lignan,which was determined to have the ability to favorably modu-late SBP in older adults, which would help to decrease risk incardiovascular disease [26].Interestingly, enterolactone isone of the substances that distinguishes the metabolism ofdiﬀerent intestinal microbial models [27].In the present study, α-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and kynurenine were downregulated after ET administration, while entero-lactone was upregulated.Other metabolites, such as deoxy-cholic acid, fumaric acid, N-acetylgalactosamine, and nonanoic acid, were also downregulated.The mechanism governing the involvement of these metabolites in bloodpressure regulation has not been elucidated.

Our fecal metabonomics data suggested that metabolites aﬀected by ET were primarily enriched in ABC transporters, phenylalanine metabolism, central carbon metabolism in can-cer, purine metabolism, L-tyrosine digestion and absorption,mineral absorption, taste transduction, renal cell carcinoma,fatty acid biosynthesis, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. 4.1.Protein-, Amino Acid-, and Purine-Related Metabolism.ABC transporters contribute primarily to energy metabolismand transport various substrates, including ions, peptides,lipids, and proteins, involving many key physiological andpathological processes.Although these transporters havenot been related to hypertension, they are closely related to atherosclerosis, gout and hyperuricemia, coronary heart disease, and other diseases that are high-risk factors forhypertension [24, 30, 31].It is worth noting that phenylalanine metabolism is a pre- cursor to catecholamine biosynthesis.
There is an abnormalstate of phenylalanine metabolism in spontaneously hyper-tensive rats. The intake of aromatic amino acids, includingphenylalanine (AAAs), increases the risk of hypertensionaccording to a clinical study of 4288 individuals [32].Inour study, ET treatment signi ﬁcantly downregulated the phenylalanine-related metabolic pathway, which we hypoth-esized is one of the mechanisms by which ET exerts its hypotensive e ﬀects.Abnormal purine metabolism is an independent risk factor for hypertension.Hyperuricemia is caused by abnor- mal purine metabolism, which leads to a decrease in nitricoxide synthesis, changes in the biological behavior of vascularsmooth muscle cells, in ﬂammation, oxidative stress, and an increased risk of hypertension.ET treatment e ﬀectively downregulated purine metabolism levels.4.2.Lipid- and Fatty Acid-Related Metabolism.Fatty acid metabolism has multiple e ﬀects on the development of hypertension.
Short-chain fatty acids are among the primary products of intestinal microbial metabolism, and they aﬀ ect the blood pressure level of the host through Gpr41. Acuteshort-chain fatty-acid administration can decrease the bloodpressure levels of spontaneously hypertensive rats [33],improve nutrient digestibility, inhibit the proliferation ofharmful bacteria, and increase the abundance of bene ﬁcial bacteria [34].The intestinal microbiota are the only sourceof short-chain fatty acids in the host.In this study, ET treat-ment improved the function of the intestinal microbiota, thereby aﬀ ecting the metabolism of fatty acids, which helped to maintain overall health.4.3.Cancer-Related Metabolism.There is a de ﬁnite relation- ship between the pathogenesis of hypertension and cancer.These diseases share similar risk factors and pathophysiologymechanisms.
Hypertension increased the risk of mortalityfrom cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma, according toa retrospective study conducted in 2002 [35]. In the presentstudy, after the 6-week administration of ET, both central car-bon metabolism in cancer and renal cell carcinoma-related levels were changed in SHRs.Interestingly, both Eucommia ulmoides andTribulus terrestris are considered to be kidney tonifying agents in traditional Chinese medicine.4.4.Mineral Absorption.Minerals are necessary elements to maintain physiological activities.It is known that the levels of certain elements, such as Ni and Co, in the serum are neg-atively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure,while the serum Se level is positively correlated with bloodpressure.Physical function declines with aging, and disordersof mineral absorption and metabolism are exacerbated, whichis not conducive to the regulation of blood pressure.
In this study, the body’ s absorption of minerals was signi ﬁcantly improved after ET administration, which was a notable exam- ple of the multitarget e ﬀect of traditional Chinese medicine. 4.5.Taste Transduction.Taste transduction is related to neu- roendocrine regulation, and the mechanisms of sensing tastein the oral cavity have been thoroughly characterized.Severalstudies [36] have demonstrated the existence of ingested sub-stances along the gastrointestinal tract as additional mecha-nisms, showing that the recognition receptor of ingestedsubstances released gastrointestinal hormones and regulated energy homeostasis through the vagus nerve and enteric aﬀerents.The taste conduction pathway was improved by ET, indicating that ET may have a corresponding e ﬀect on neuroendocrine regulation.Table 1: Fecal metabonomics.

In addition, Erysipelotrichaceae in SHRs also exhibited a correlation with ﬂavonoid metabolism. It is known that ﬂavonoids are impor- tant pharmacophore monomers in both Eucommia ulmoides andTribulus terrestris [39].Flavonoids have a signi ﬁcant pro- tective e ﬀect on the cardiovascular system, as well as pharma- cological activities of lowering blood pressure and bloodlipids, reducing oxidation and inhibiting in ﬂammation [40].Because Erysipelotrichaceae was identi ﬁed as a biomarker of ET in this study, we speculated that ET may regulate blood pressure by targeting lipid and ﬂavonoid metabolism by increasing the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae .Meanwhile, an increase in the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae after ETtreatment helped to regulate the structure of the intestinal microbiota of SHRs.We determined that ET treatmentaﬀected metabolism and enhanced the utilization of ﬂavo- noids in SHRs.5.
Conclusion The combination of Eucommia ulmoides andTribulus terres- trisyielded a good antihypertensive e ﬀect, and this e ﬃcacy was related to the improvement of the intestinal microbiota and their related metabolites. We hope that these results serve to elucidate the antihypertensive e ﬀects of the combina- tion of Eucommia ulmoides andTribulus terrestris .Data Availability The datasets used and/or analyzed during the present studyare available from the corresponding author on reasonablerequest.
