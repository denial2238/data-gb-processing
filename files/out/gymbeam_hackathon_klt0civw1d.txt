Melatonin levels increase signi ﬁcantly during pregnancy and indicate that placenta is a major source of melatonin, that plays a protective role against oxidative stress in pregnancy.

During pregnancy there is ∼50% increase in iodine requirement for foetal neurode- velopment. The most recently studied cohorts of pregnantwomen across Ireland and UK consistently demonstratedmild iodine de ﬁciency (target median urinary iodine con- centration (mUIC) ≥150 µg/L).A recent study in NI has shown that women of child-bearing age provided withthree litres of cow ’s milk per week had improved iodine status.We wished to explore whether a similar milk inter-vention might improve iodine status during pregnancy.Pregnant women were recruited at their ﬁrst antenatal appointment, and all were provided with the BritishDietetic Association ’s iodine food fact sheet.Participants were randomised to either milk intervention, (fourlitres/week milk delivered weekly free of charge), or nomilk delivery (control group).Patients were strati ﬁed based on use of an iodine-containing multivitamin priorto randomisation.
Urine was collected at recruitment,after 12-week intervention period, in the third trimesterand 6-12 weeks postnatally along with an infant urinesample when possible. A total of 55 urine samples werecollected from infants.A total of 118 women were re-cruited.Participants had a mean age of 32 years, (range21 - 45) with a mean BMI of 27.5 kg/m 2.Mean gestational age was 12 weeks (IQR 12-13 weeks).The mUIC in thew h o l eg r o u pw o m e nw a s5 3 .2µ g / Li nt h e ﬁrst trimester.In the control group the mUIC at the ﬁrst study visit (n=59) was 93.4 µg/L (22% achieving iodine suf ﬁciency); at the second visit (n =38), the mUIC was 158.7 µg/L with 34% achieving suf ﬁciency.In the milk group the mUIC at the ﬁr s ts t u d yv i s i t( n =59) was 82.0 µg/L with 10% achieving suf ﬁciency (no statistical signi ﬁcance be- tween groups, p =0.08); at the second visit (n =43), mUIC was 154.7 µg/L with 37% achieving suf ﬁciency (no statis- tical difference between groups p =0.78).
The mean change in UIC between the ﬁrst and second trimesters was 44.5 and 88.1 µg/L in the control and milk arms respectively(p=0.27). In this cohort, 71.4% of women reported taking an iodine-containing multivitamin in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy with no difference between group rando-mised to milk intervention (p =0.95).In the infants, mUIC was 124.1 µg/L with no statistically difference inthe proportion reaching iodine suf ﬁciency according to maternal randomisation (p =0.64) or maternal use of an iodine-containing multivitamin (p =0.95).In this cohort, there was no signi ﬁcant improvement in mUIC in those receiving a milk intervention.
