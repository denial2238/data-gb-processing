Recent studies have shown that combination of both, PGL and ﬁsh oil signiﬁcantly reducefasting plasma glucose, improve insulin resistance, and mitigate pioglitazone-induced subcutaneous fat accumulation and weight gain.
Nevertheless, developing an effective oral drug delivery system for administration of both medications have not been explored yet. Thus, this study aimed to develop aself-micro emulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for the simultaneous oral administration of PGL and ﬁsh oil.SMEDDS was developed using concentrated ﬁsh oil,Tween /C21080, and Transcutol HP and opti- mized by central composite design (CCD).The reconstituted, optimized PGL-SMEDDS exhibited a globulesize of 142 nm, a PDI of 0.232, and a zeta potential of /C020.9 mV.The in-vitro drug release study of the PGL-SMEDDS showed a ﬁrst-order model kinetic release and demonstrated remarkable 15-fold enhance- ment compared to PGL suspension.Additionally, following oral administration in fasting albino Wistarrats, PGL-SMEDDS exhibited 3.4-fold and 1.4-fold enhancements in the AUC 0–24h compared to PGL sus- pension and PGL marketed product.
The accelerated stability testing showed that the optimized SMEDDS formulation was stable over a three-month storage period. Taken together, our ﬁndings demon- strate that the developed ﬁsh oil-based SMEDDS for PGL could serve as effective nanoplatforms for theoral delivery of PGL, warranting future studies to explore its synergistic therapeutic potential in rats./C2112023 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of King Saud University.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).1.Introduction Impairment in lipid and protein metabolism, as well as hyper- glycemia due to abnormalities in insulin production or insulin action, characterise the metabolic disorder known as diabetes mel- litus (DM).
In the recent decade, diabetes mellitus has risen dra-matically, especially in undeveloped countries, with more than 641 million people predicted to live with type-2 diabetes world- wide by 2040 ( McCormick et al., 2019 ). Type-2 DM is primarily linked with insulin resistance (IR) due to genetic character, changes in lifestyle, dietary habits, and sedentary behaviours.Blood free fatty acid elevations during hyperglycemic states are associated with decreased insulin gene expression, thus contribut- ing signiﬁcantly to the pathogenesis of IR in obesity and non- insulin-dependent DM ( Amery et al., 2000; Boden, 1996; Kalin et al., 2017 ).Many approaches for treating diabetes have been reported, ranging from therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, b- cells regeneration, boosting b-cells self-replication, and stem cells) to pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches ( Tan et al., 2019 ).
Pioglitazone (PGL) belongs chemically to the class of thiazo- lidinediones, which are selective peroxisome proliferator- activated (PPAR) c-agonists for the treatment of diabetes type-2. PGL prevents hypoglycemia and preserves b-cell function by decreasing peripheral tissue’s IR without inducing insulin produc- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2023.103778 1319-562X/ /C2112023 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of King Saud University.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).⇑Corresponding author at: Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceu- tical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard (Deemed University), M.B.Road, NewDelhi 110062, India.E-mail addresses: nasraliemad_sch@jamiahamdard.ac.in (N.A.Emad), ysulta- na@jamiahamdard.ac.in (Y.Sultana), maqil@jamiahamdard.ac.in (M.Aqil), AsA- li@pnu.edu.sa (A.Saleh), omalkmali@pnu.edu.sa (O.Al kamaly), Fnasr@ksu.edu.sa (F.A Nasr).

Therefore, its poor oral bioavailability and adverse effects impact its therapeutic potential. EPA and DHA are two examples of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (PUFAs) rich in ﬁsh oil, which is used as a nutritionalsupplement, that favorably inﬂuence plasma lipoproteins and are beneﬁcial to IR and dyslipidemia ( Gao et al., 2017; Martins et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017 ).The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a(PPAR- a) has a mediating role in these actions and omega-3 fatty acids are considered PPAR- aagonists ( Eissa et al., 2015; Jump, 2008 ).PPAR is a nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of many genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism ( Varga et al., 2011 ).
The combi- nation of PGL and PUFAs-rich ﬁsh oils considerably reduced fasting plasma glucose, improved IR, retarding hepatic lipogenesis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, therefore inhibiting PGL-induced fat accumulation, weight gain, pancreatic islets hypertrophy, and b-cell dysfunction ( Hasan et al., 2020; Iizuka et al., 2018, 2016a, 2016b ). However, an effective oral delivery system for both medi- cations have not been developed yet.SMEDDS are isotropic mixtures of oils and surfactants that gen- erate oil-in-water microemulsions when added to water and stir- red gently ( Huo et al., 2018 ).The globule size of the SMEDDS ranges between 50 and 250 nm ( Emad et al., 2021 ).Various researchers reported improved bioavailability of drugs with poor water-solubility after oral administration using SMEDDS ( Bolko et al., 2013; Kanwal et al., 2019; Patel and Sawant, 2019; Manali D.Prajapat et al., 2017 ).
Factors such as nano-sized droplets of SMEDDS, higher solubilization capacity, changes in GI tract bio- chemical barrier function, and lymphatic transport can make a sig- niﬁcant contribution to drug absorption ( Patel and Sawant, 2019; Manali D Prajapat et al., 2017 ). Given the previously described beneﬁts of PGL and omega-3 fatty acids in mitigating insulin resistance.The present work aims to develop and statistically optimize omega-3 fatty acids-based SMEDDS of PGL to enhance its solubility and oral bioavailability.The developed SMEDDS was optimized by using central composite design and evaluated for self-emulsiﬁcation performance, mor-phology, stability studies, and in-vitro drug release.Furthermore, thein-vivo oral bioavailability was compared with that of PGL sus- pension and PGL marketed product in rats.2.Materials and methods 2.1.Materials Sigma-Aldrich, USA was sourced for our supply of PGL (CAS No.: 112529–15-4).
Concentrated ﬁsh oil (Total Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Minimum 30%) was purchased from Arian Enterprises, Delhi, India. Gift samples of Capryol TM90 and Transcutol/C210HP (UNII code: A1A1I8X02B) were generously provided by Gattefosse Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India.Capmul/C210MCM C8 was obtained from Abetic Corpo- ration, Columbus, USA.Both ethyl oleate and Tween/C21080 originated from Merck (India).S.D.Fine Chemicals, Ltd.(Mumbai, India) pro- vided us with microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, soluble starch,and lactose.The Dialysis tubing membrane was purchased from Abron Exports (Haryana, India).All of the solvents used in the experiments were of analytical quality, and HPLC water was uti- lised throughout.2.2.Methods2.2.1.Screening for SMEDDS components To choose the appropriate component for SMEDDS, the solubil- ity of pioglitazone HCl was estimated in oils and surfactants.
For this, pioglitazone was dissolved in one mL of each vehicle in excess, and the resulting mixtures were vortexed for 15 min to evenly dis- tribute the PGL throughout the vehicles. They were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min after being incubated at 25 /C176C in an orbital incubator shaker for 72 hr.Following proper dilution of the super-natant with methanol, the PGL was analyzed spectrometrically by measuring the absorbance at 270 nm (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan).2.2.2.Assessing surfactants emulsiﬁcation capacity For screening of the surfactant, a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of the oil phase and surfactant was mixed and diluted ﬁfty times with double dis- tilled water.The % Transmittance and number of inversions were recorded using a UV spectrophotometer at 638 nm ( Bolko et al., 2013; Kanwal et al., 2019 ).Similarly, surfactant and co-surfactant at 2:1 (v/v) were vortexed, diluted ﬁfty times with double distilled water, and the number of inversions and %Transmittance were recorded.2.2.3.
Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams To develop PGL-SMEDDS, a water titration method was estab- lished to estimate the microemulsion region at room temperature. S mix, Tween/C21080 (surfactant) and Transcutol HP (co-surfactant), were used in four different volume ratios (Km values 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1).Different glass vials were used to mix each Km value with increasing percentages of oil by 10th up to 90%, to create the phase diagram.To achieve equilibrium, aliquots of distilled water were slowly added at separate intervals and stirred at 25 /C176C.The turbid-to-transparent and transparent-to-turbid changes were visually tracked and recorded on a ternary phase diagram table.The free version of CHEMIX was used to construct the pseudo- ternary plots ( Manali D.Prajapat et al., 2017 ).2.2.4.
Optimization of oil and S mix Design Expert 13 (Stat-Ease Inc., USA) was used to carry out a central composite design (CCD) for the purpose of optimizing the oil and Smixinvolved in the generation of the SMEDDS. Table 1 summarises both the independent and dependent variables, as well as their respective levels.Globule size, %transmittance, andPDI were optimized as dependent variables, with oil (mg) and S mix (mg) serving as independent variables with varying levels of con- trol over these metrics based on the pseudo-ternary phase diagram result.According to the CCD, there should be 13 formulation runs highlighted on ﬁve central points, four factorial points, and four axial points ( Alhalmi et al., 2022b ).2.2.5.Preparation of PGL- SMEDDS Liquid SMEDDS was prepared using a 4:1 Smixratio based on pseudo-ternary phase diagrams.The oil phase was prepared by mixing ﬁsh oil and ethyl oleate (3:1) in screw-capped glass vials using a vortex mixer (Remi, India).
The determined amount of Smix was added to the oil phase gradually while stirring constantly until a uniform mixture was obtained. The same steps were used to pre- pare PGL-loaded SMEDDS.Further, the drug, PGL was dissolved in oil and Smixat a temperature of 50 /C176C by vortexing and ultrasonica- tion (30 s) to assure the complete dissolution of pioglitazone in SMEDDS ( Choi et al., 2014 ).The amount of pioglitazone was theN.A.Emad, Y.Sultana, M.Aqil et al.Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 (2023) 103778 2 same in all formulations (7.5 mg/ml SMEDDS).This formulation preconcentrate was inspected for turbidity, phase separation, or gelling effect and kept at room temperature for further evaluation.For solid-state characterization, liquid SMEDDS was lyophilized using microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as a water-soluble carrier.
Brieﬂy, 5 % (w/v) of MCC was added to the prepared SMEDDS before it being lyophilized for 6 hr using Bench-top Vacuum FreezeDryer (FD-10, LABFREEZ INSTRUMENTS GROUP CO., LTD, China). 2.2.6.Evaluation of PGL-SMEDDS 2.2.6.1.%Transmittance and viscosity.A rheometer (Brookﬁeld, Inc., MA, USA), spindle no.6 at 100 rpm for 5 min, was used to deter- mine the viscosity of pioglitazone-SMEDDS, and the relevant dial reading on the viscometer was recorded.Percent transmittance was determined by diluting the formulation at 10:1000 with dou- ble distilled water and measuring the % transmittance at 638 nm by UV–vis spectrophotometer ( Patel and Sawant, 2019 ).2.2.6.2.Robustness.Robustness to dilution was conﬁrmed by dilut- ing a speciﬁc amount of SMEDDS at varied dilution factors (e.g., 50, 100, or 1000 times) with various liquids such as bi-distilled water, 0.1 N HCl, and PBS (pH 7.4).
The diluted microemulsions were tested visually at 0, 2, and 6 hr for any physical alteration (Kanwal et al., 2019 ). 2.2.6.3.Self-emulsiﬁcation time test.Self-emulsiﬁcation perfor- mance was conducted with a magnetic stirrer running at 200 rpm and distilled water as a medium at 37 ± 0.5 /C176C.After the addition of one ml of pioglitazone-SMEDDS formulation to 100 ml of the aqueous medium, the time interval between the addition of the SMEDDS and the completion of emulsiﬁcation, at which point the self-microemulsion was clear and somewhat blu- ish in appearance, was recorded ( Huo et al., 2018 ).2.2.6.4.Droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential.The mean globule size, PDI, and zeta potential of the diluted PGL- SMEDDS (1:100 v/v) were determined by Zeta Sizer (Malvern, UK) with the non-invasive backscatter method.Light dispersiondue to Brownian droplet motion was measured at a wavelength of 630 nm, a scattering angle of 90 /C176, and a temperature of 25 /C176C.
(Liu et al., 2020 ). 2.2.6.5.TEM.The transmission electron microscopy (TECHNAI-G2, Netherlands) study was conducted to conﬁrm the morphology of the optimized SMEDDS.A drop of SMEDDS was placed on a grid and left there for one min after being diluted 50 times with bi- distilled water so that it would attach better to the carbon sub- strate.The grid was then incubated with a drop of 1% phospho- tungstate for 10 s, after which the excess solution was ﬁltered off.The material was then dried and examined by transmission electron microscopy ( Mohit et al., 2022 ).2.2.6.6.Release of PGL-SMEDDS.Using 100 ml of freshly prepared dissolution mediums (0.1 N HCl pH 1.2 and PBS pH 6.8), the in-vitro release studies were conducted in accordance with the USP XXIV method with some modiﬁcations.The apparatus was set at 100 rpm and a temperature of 37 ± 0.5 /C176C.
The dialysis bag (Abron Exports, Haryana, India)) was made ready for the experiment by soaking it in warm water for 2–5 min to make it soft enough to work efﬁciently. The other end was sealed with a thermo- resistant thread, and the dialysis bag was infused with PGL-SMEDDS formulation (equivalent to 7.5 mg of PGL), which was then sealed and allowed to rotate freely in 100 ml of dissolution medium kept over the stirrer.At regular intervals, one mL was withdrawed, and the aliquot of dissolution medium was substi- tuted to keep the sink condition.An equivalent amount of PGL was suspended in a suspension and compared to the drug release from the SMEDDS formulation.PGL released was analyzed spec- trophotometrically at 270 nm ( Ahmad et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2019 ).2.2.6.7.Determination of drug content.Pioglitazone from the SMEDDS formulation (theoretically equivalent to 7.5 mg PGL) was retrieved in 10 ml methanol.
The diluted sample was cen- trifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm using a tabletop centrifuge (Remi, India). The supernatant was ﬁltered, and the pioglitazone concen-tration was determined using the previously reported HPLC method ( Prasad et al., 2015 ).Brieﬂy, the RP-HPLC system (SPI- VP, Shimadzu, Japan) with a C18 column at 25 ± 1 /C176C and UV– vis- ible detector at a wavelength of 270 nm was used for analysis.The mobile phase was a 40: 60 ratio of ammonium acetate buffer: ace-tonitrile at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 ml/min.The detection time for PGL was 5.85 min.2.2.6.8.FT-IR.The FT-IR analysis of the lyophilized PGL-SMEDDS was done by the KBr disc procedure with an FT-IR spectropho- tometer (Bruker, UK-MSA).Samples were dispersed with KBr and converted into translucent pellets by compressing them at a mechanical pressure of 200 psi before being scanned in a range of 4000–––400 cm /C01(Padhi et al., 2016 ).2.2.6.9.Analysis of thermal behavior.
Pure drug and SMEDDS differ- ential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted on a Perkin Elmer Pyres 6 DSC, USA. Approximately 3 mg of each pure drug and solid SMEDDS were taken in aluminum pans and then sealed with a DSC loading puncher.An empty, crimped aluminum pan was used on the other side as a control.Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the sam- ples were scanned at 40 to 300 /C176C with increments of 5 /C176C/min (The gaseous nitrogen was supplied at a rate of 20 ml/min and a pres- sure of 2 bars).The DSC peaks were noted ( Khuroo et al., 2018 ).2.2.6.10.Stability study of PGL-SMEDDS.For three months, PGL- SMEDDS was stored at room temperature (RT) and under acceler- ated conditions (40 /C176C±2 /C176C and 75% ± 5% RH) as part of a stability study performed in accordance with ICH recommendations to assess the impact of temperature and humidity on the PGL- SMEDDS.

Rats were housed in a controlled environment (23 ± 2 /C176C; 12 hr light /dark cycle). The rats were equally allocated into four groups each having four animals (n = 4) and named as control, pure drug-treated (group II), marketed tablets treated (group III), and liquid SMEDDS treated (group IV).2.2.7.2.A bioanalytical HPLC method.Pioglitazone levels in rat plasma were determined using the RP-HPLC method.Components were separated using a LiChrospher R C18 column (5 lm pore size; Merck, Germany) and a 60:40 combination of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer as a mobile phase at ﬂow rate of 0.8 ml/min and 25 ± 1 /C176C temperature.The retention time was 3.65 min and the eluent was censored at 270 nm using a PDA detector.Limits of quantitation (LOQ) and detection (LOD) were calculated to be 134.24 and 72.13 ng/ml, respectively.2.2.7.3.Experimental protocol.Prior to the experiments, the rats had unrestricted access to water and a rat-appropriate meal (Lipton feed, Mumbai, India).
Rats were made to fast overnight before being given their doses. The PGL suspension and PGL marketed tablet were prepared by suspending the required amount of PGL in 0.5% methylcellulose (MW 14000 Da, viscosity 15 cP).PGL sus- pension, PGL marketed tablet, and PGL-SMEDDS were adminis-tered orally using oral gavage at a dose equivalent to 3 mg/kg of PGL to Group II, Group III, and Group IV, respectively.Rats were given an i.p.injection of ketamine/xylazine (75/8 mg/kg), and then 0.5 ml of blood was taken from their tail veins at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr, and preserved in EDTA-coated microcentrifuge tubes.After 10 min of 10,000 rpm centrifugation, the plasma was transferred and kept in a /C020/C176C freezer until analysis.Then plasma samples were treated with 400 ll of ethyl acetate to deproteinize the proteins, vortexed for 2 min to prevent elution interference in the analysis, and then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min.
Evapo- ration of ethyl acetate was carried out in new vials, and the mobile phase was added to reconstitute the dried samples, which were then ﬁltered and injected into the HPLC column at 20 ll. The extravascular compartmental approach was used to derive the pharmacokinetic parameters, and the PK-Solver (Version 2.0) was used to estimate the parameters in MS-Excel-2019.( Chaudhary et al., 2019 ).2.2.8.Statistics The data are existing as the mean ± SD of three separate repli- cates.One-way ANOVA was used to determine the signiﬁcant level (P < 0.05 value is used to show statistical signiﬁcance).3.Results 3.1.Screening of excipients Screening of SMEDDS components was done as the solubility capacity of a vehicle was critical for SMEDDS stability.The results for PGL solubility in different excipients are presented in ( Fig.1 ).PGL showed the highest solubility in ethyl oleate (17.72 mg/ml), followed by ﬁsh oil (14.1 mg/ml) among oils.
Fish oil was mixed with ethyl oleate in a 3:1 ratio as an oil phase. The surfactantwas chosen for its PGL-solubility and its capacity to emulsify the oil phase i.e.ﬁsh oil & ethyl oleate.Among various surfactants screened for solubility, PGL showed the highest solubility in Tween/C21080 (13.71 mg/ml).In addition, Tween/C21080 showed good miscibility with the oil phase.Supplementary Table S1 shows the percent transmittance values and the number of inversions needed for the uniform emulsion of different dispersions.Hence, Tween/C210 80 was decided upon as the surfactant of choice.Miscibility testswere performed using the oils and a surfactant to determine the best co-surfactant to use.Transcutol HP showed good miscibility with the oils and surfactant system, so selected as a co-surfactant.3.2.
Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams construction Determining the excipient ratio for SMEDDS is the crucial step in formulating to achieve balance during loading and prevent pre- cipitation when diluted in GIT ﬂuids. Thus, a phase diagram study was conducted to establish the relationship between the SMEDDS components.Fish oil and ethyl oleate at a 3:1 ratio, Tween /C21080, Transcutol HP, and bi-distilled water (aqueous phase) were used to construct pseudo-ternary phase diagrams.The water titration procedure was used for each combination of oil and Smixindividually.A water con- centration of 5% to 90% of the total volume was achieved by adding the aqueous phase in 5% increments.Because the o/w interfacial tension needed to generate stable SMEDDS cannot be reduced by using a Km value of 1:1, a small microemulsion area has been accomplished.
The highest microemulsion region was attained at a Km value of 4:1 when the Tween/C21080 to Transcutol HP ratio was raised from 1:1 to 4:1 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Small glob- ules were formed when there was a high Tween/C21080 concentration because it reduces interfacial tension and enables surfactants to diffuse into the aqueous phase.Besides, interfacial tension was fur- ther reduced by the Transcutol HP, which makes a ﬂexible ﬁlm, increases the system’s entropy, and changes the polarity, density, refractive index, and viscosity of the aqueous phase.So, the Km value of 4:1 was therefore selected for further exploration.3.3.Optimization of concentration of oil and S mix Five center, four axial, and four factorial runs with varying oil and Smixconcentrations were automatically created using the CCD design.As per the proposed runs, the formulations were pre- pared and the particle size, % transmittance, and PDI were noted (Table 2 ).
These observations were recorded to study the inﬂuence Fig. 1.Solubility of pioglitazone in various vehicles.Each value represents the mean ± S.D.(n = 3).N.A.Emad, Y.Sultana, M.Aqil et al.Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 (2023) 103778 4 of independent factors i.e.oil and Smixon the dependent variables i.e.particle size, % transmittance, and PDI.The results of the tested dependent variables, particle size (Y1), % T (Y2), and PDI (Y3), fall within the ranges of 120–295 nm, 89– 98.9%, and 0.099–0.275, respectively.A quadratic model provided the greatest ﬁt for the data from all three responses, suggesting that the model was statistically signiﬁcant ( Supplementary Table S2,3,4 ).‘‘Predicted R2 ” values were consistent with ‘‘Adjusted R2 ” values for all responses (i.e.the difference < 0.2) (Table 2 ).Adeq.Precision is more than 4 for the three responses which indicates the ratio of the signal to the noise.
Equation (1)shows that oil concentration and Smixwere major factors in determining droplet size. The 3D response surface plots (Fig.2 A) showed that the droplet size raised with the oil concentra- tion and decreased with the Smixconcentration.The formulation is stabilized by the high concentration of surfactant by forming a bar- rier on the SMEDDS’ surface, inhibiting them from aggregating into bigger particles.Y1¼145 :16þ38 :4616 /C2Aþ/C012 :4711 /C2Bþ/C09:8/C2AB þ48 :5575 /C2A2þ/C02:6925 /C2B2......Eq ð1Þ Polynomial Equation (2)showed how oil and surfactant concen- tration affected the percent of transmittance.The transmittance study showed an inverse relationship with oil concentration and a positive relationship with Smixconcentration ( Fig.2 B).When the percentage of transmittance was high, it showed that the par- ticles were evenly dispersed, whereas a low number indicated a turbid formulation ( Solanki et al., 2022 ).

To maximize SMEDDS absorption and stability, the optimal polynomial model was utilized to guide a numerical optimization procedure with desired values for all response variables, such as ‘‘minimum” par- ticle size, ‘‘minimum” PDI, and maximum % transmittance. The optimal PGL-SMEDDS formulation was predicted by the design expert CCD software by means of quadratic modeling for all depen-dent variables and constraints tailored to them.According to CCD, the ﬁnal report for optimized PGL-SMEDDS was comprised of 16 mg oil (Fish oil: Ethyl oleate, 3:1) and 80 mg S mix(Tween/C210 80: Transcutol HP, 4:1).Graphical optimization was utilized to pro- duce an overlay plot ( Fig.2 D), which shows the predicted values of all dependent variables for the optimal PGL-SMEDDS combination.This optimized PGL-SMEDDS has anticipated values of 145.16 nm, 98.2% transmittance, and PDI of 0.217 ( Fig.2 D).
Whereas, 142.0 nm, 98.1%, and 0.232 were measured as the actual responses after applying this combination ( Table 2 ). Considering that the pre- diction error between the model and the observed data was<5%, we concluded that the model was adequate and reliable ( Alhalmi et al., 2022a ).3.4.Characterization of PGL-SMEDDS 3.4.1.Viscosity and %Transmittance To ensure that SMEDDS is physically stable, the viscosity char- acter is evaluated.Also, SMEDDS dispersion in an aqueous medium is critical since the low emulsiﬁcation rate of more viscous formu- lations can affect drug release and bioavailability ( Patel and Sawant, 2019 ).The viscosity was 59.6 ± 2.4cP, low enough to facil- itate quick emulsiﬁcation.The % transmittance value was 98 ± 1.30 %, indicating the clarity by visual check, which is a fundamental requirement for microemulsion.3.4.2.Robustness to dispersion Distilled water, pH 1.2, and pH 7.4 were used to dilute PGL- SMEDDS.
No precipitation nor phase separation occurred in anyTable 2 CCD-observed PGL-SMEDDS runs along with actual dependent variables values and the regression analyses of speciﬁed responses.

Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 (2023) 103778 5 of the test media or dilutions.According to this, aqueous phase pH does not affect microemulsion formulation .3.4.3.Self-emulsiﬁcation time test Emulsiﬁcation time is a signiﬁcant parameter for determining the spontaneity of microemulsion development, so SMEDDS should be dispersed immediately in the GIT ﬂuid following oral administration.The PGL-SMEDDS emulsiﬁcation time was 40.0 ± 2.0 sec, indicating that the system will effectively self- micro emulsify and be ready to disperse in GIT ﬂuid.This may be due to Transcutol HP, which signiﬁcantly affects interfacial charac- teristics such as spontaneous arrangement, polarity, thickness, and interfacial tension ( Patel and Sawant, 2019 ).3.4.4.Globule size, PDI, zeta potential and TEM The mean globule size of the developed PGL-SMEDDS was 142 nm with a PDI of 0.232 ( Fig.3 A).Zeta potential was measured at/C020.9 mV ( Fig.
3 B), which, in combination with the adsorbed surfactant layer, provides the repulsion required to prevent globu- lar coalescence. This result conﬁrms the PGL-SMEDDS physical sta- bility.TEM was also used to observe the shape of the microemulsion generated from the SMEDDS formulation.(Fig.3 C) illustrates the spherical shape of the emulsion droplets in the absence of aggregation.3.4.5.Drug content The drug content of the PGL-SMEDDS was determined using the HPLC method, with 7.5 mg of pioglitazone assumed to be 100%.The PGL content of the PGL-SMEDDS was found to be 98.61%, which is Fig.2.Response surface curve: Effect of oil and S mixon particle size (A), %transmittance (B), and PDI (C) and Overlay plot (D): The yellow region denotes the design space and the optimal PGL-SMEDDS displayed by the ﬂag mark.N.A.Emad, Y.Sultana, M.Aqil et al.Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 (2023) 103778 6 within the speciﬁed range (90–110%) deﬁned in IP 2010 and con- ﬁrms the PGL-SMEDDS stability.
3.4.6. FT-IR analysis FTIR analysis has been conducted to detect any potential inter- actions between the SMEDDS components and the drug.Absorp- tion peaks at 3337.04, 2829.82, 1739.66, and 1682.88 cm/C01in the FTIR spectrum of PGL-SMEDDS correspond to the N–H stretch- ing vibration, C–H aliphatic stretching, and two carbonyl functions, respectively ( Fig.4 A2).Slight variations in the drug’s characteristic peaks have been seen in PGL-SMEDDS in comparison to the pure PGL FTIR spectrum ( Fig.4 A1), which can be ascribed to non- binding drug interactions with SMEDDS components ( Kanwal et al., 2019 ).FTIR evaluation conﬁrms the good chemical stability of PGL inside the optimized PGL-SMEDDS formulation.3.4.7.Differential scanning calorimetry The thermotropic characteristics and thermal character of the drug and excipients utilized in PGL-SMEDDS formulations were determined using DSC.An exothermic peak temperature of 196.63 /C176C was reported as the melting point of PGL ( Fig.4 B1).
The DSC thermogram of the lyophilized PGL-SMEDDS ( Fig. 4 B2) shows an exothermic peak at 126.947 /C176C, which is related to the melting point of the carrier, microcrystalline cellulose ( de Oliveira et al., 2017 ).The absence of the crystalline peak of PGL in the lyophilized PGL-SMEDDS suggested uniform drug adsorp-tion on the carrier.It was probably due to the molecular disper- sion/dissolution of PGL in the SMEDDS components or interactions at the molecular level.3.4.8.Drug released study in-vitro Since a drug is released as a free molecule, micelle, or microemulsion droplet upon contact with water, traditional in-vitro dissolution methods are not ideal for studying the in-vitro dissolution of SMEDDS.So particular drug molecules should be segregated from micelles or microemulsions ( Javed Ahmad, Kanchan Kohli, 2011 ).Dissolution studies using a dialysis bag ensure consistent medication release.
Since the PGL release from SMEDDS was shown to be constant regardless of the pH of the dis- solving medium (pH 1.2 and pH 6.8), it may be concluded that the PGL release from SMEDDS is pH-independent ( Fig. 5 A&B).A higher drug release (59.13%) was observed in the ﬁrst two hr at pH 1.2 than at pH 6.8 (31.34%) ( Supplementary Table S5, S6 ).Most of the PGL was dissolved in the oil phase, with a reasonable propor-tion dispersed on the interface of the oil and water, which may lead to rapid release into the water when SMEDDS formulations were put into aqueous media with gentle agitation.Otherwise, diffusion through the droplet surface may limit pioglitazone’s release in the oil phase.The release proﬁle of the PGL from SMEDDS was 15 and 1.6 times more than that of the suspension in both PBS (pH 6.8) (Fig.5 B) and 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) ( Fig.5 A), respectively.
Many mathematical models namely, Zero order, First order, Korsmeyer-peppas, and Higuchi models were used to ﬁt the piogli- tazone dissolution curves from SMEDDS formulations in order to investigate the release mechanism. Results show that the ﬁrst- order model is the best way to study how PGL is released from SMEDDS formulation at both pHs because the highest correlation coefﬁcient (R 2) value was obtained ( Supplementary Figure S2, S3 ).3.4.9.Stability study The results for the stability parameters measured are given in Table 3 .The SMEDDS formulation was analyzed for self- emulsiﬁcation time, assay for drug content, % transmittance, and globule size.SMEDDS remained clear at all storage conditions, i.e., no drug precipitation or cloudiness marks.In other words, the medication maintained its solubilized state both at ambient Fig.3.Morphology of the optimized PGL-SMEDDS: Globule size (A), Zeta potential (B), and TEM (C).N.A.Emad, Y.Sultana, M.Aqil et al.

Similarly, self-emulsiﬁcation time, % transmittance, and global size show insigniﬁcant changes, and the microemulsion system wasconsidered stable upon dilution with uniform globule size distribu- tion.In addition, after 3 months of storage, there was no dis- cernible drop in PGL content for SMEDDS, demonstrating the Fig.4.(A1) FT-IR spectra of Pure PGL, (A2) FT-IR spectra of PGL-loaded SMEDDS, (B1) DSC of Pure PGL and (B2) DSC of PGL-loaded SMEDDS.Fig.5.Drug released from PLG-SMEDDS and PLG suspension in (A) 0.1 N HCl, and (B) PBS (pH 6.8).Each value represents the mean ± S.D.(n = 3).* and *** represent p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively, compared with PGL suspension.N.A.Emad, Y.Sultana, M.Aqil et al.Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 (2023) 103778 8 drug’s continued chemical stability.
As a result, the PGL-SMEDDS was found to be stable at both room temperature and in acceler- ated conditions (40 /C176C±2 /C176C/75 ± 5 %RH). 3.4.10.Pharmacokinetics studies In albino Wistar rats, the plasma concentration–time proﬁle and pharmacokinetic data for PGL suspension, PGL-marketed tablet, and PGL-SMEDDS are displayed in Fig.6 andTable 4 , respec- tively.As a result of the rapid self-micro emulsiﬁcation of the drug in the GI lumen, the PGL-SMEDDS showed high plasma levels in rats.The C maxand AUC values showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase in PGL absorption (p < 0.05).The AUC 0–tof PGL-SMEDDS after oral administration was 3.4 and 1.4 times more than that of PGL suspension and PGL-marketed tablets, respectively.The sus- tained release of PGL from both the PGL-SMEDDS and commer- cially available tablets could explain why these formulations have a longer time to achieve maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) than PGL suspension.
Maintaining a constant plasma drug level using SMEDDS supported the increased t 1/2value. 4.Discussion Drugs must be dissolved for SMEDDS because studies have shown that a steeper concentration gradient propels the medica- tion through the gastrointestinal tract, increasing its bioavailabil- ity.Fish oil includes multi-component fatty acids, which lead to poor dispersity and low water solubility, limiting its usefulness as a standalone oil phase in SMEDDS.Therefore, ﬁsh oil was mixed with ethyl oleate in a 3:1 ratio to attain the goal of our study, which is to incorporate a high amount of ﬁsh oil into the oil phase.The prepared SMEDDS showed satisfactory levels for droplet size, PDI, and zeta potential.Smaller droplets provide more surface area for drug absorption and a faster release rate, making droplet size an important parameter in evaluating SMEDDS ( Choi et al., 2014 ).
Particle dispersion uniformity is quantiﬁed by the PDI, and dispersion stability is quantiﬁed by the zeta potential. PGL release was not impacted by the pH medium by using SMEDDS, and the release of PGL from the suspension was pH-dependent ( Fig.5 ).As a result, the barrier of poor dissolving in GIT may have been overcome, leading to improved absorption of pioglitazone from SMEDDS.The higher release from the drug suspension in 0.1 N HCl (36.4%) than in PBS (pH 6.8) (5.46%) is due to the PGL used in this research was in a salt form (pioglitazone HCl), which has more ionization in an acidic medium.The enhanced C maxand AUC values could be the effect of the enhanced SMEDDS formula- tion increasing the solubility and/or dissolving rate of PGL.Addi- tionally, excipients such as Tween/C21080 and Transcutol HP included in the SMEDDS formulation have been reported to inhibit P-gp and CYP 450(Al-Kandari et al., 2020; Markiewicz et al., 2019 ) and thus promote intestinal absorption of PGL.
The pharmacoki- netic proﬁle conﬁrms the in vitro release results showing that pioglitazone of the suspension was primarily absorbed from the stomach which can be interpreted by the higher solubility of PGL in an acidic pH and the absence of overexpression of P-gp in the stomach. However, SMEDDS showed a sustained release of piogli- tazone throughout the GI tract.Besides, small intestine absorption of the PGL was also found to be unimpeded.Future works should focus on the synergestic effect of ﬁsh oil-based PGL-SMEDDS on insulin resistance.Such data would provide useful insights intoTable 3 Stability parameters were measured during three months for the prepared PGL-SMEDDS.Condition Parameters/ Time(days) 0 30 60 90 At room temperature Visual inspection clear clear clear clear Self-emuls.

Conclusions This is the ﬁrst study that successfully developed a Self- Microemulsifying Drug Delivery System (SMEDDS) using ﬁsh oil to enhance the oral delivery of pioglitazone (PGL). The formulated SMEDDS exhibited optimal dosage form properties, including appropriate globule size, globule distribution, morphology, ther- modynamic stability, and self-emulsiﬁcation time, both in vitroand in vivo.The in vitro release study demonstrated ﬁrst-order kinetics, while the in vivo study revealed signiﬁcantly higher AUC 0–tvalues for PGL-SMEDDS compared to PGL suspension and PGL-marketed tablets, with 3.4-fold and 1.4-fold increases, respec- tively.Furthermore, the developed SMEDDS demonstrated sus- tained release of pioglitazone throughout the gastrointestinal tract without compromising drug absorption in the small intestine.Importantly, the dissolution of PGL-SMEDDS was independent of pH media, overcoming the challenge of poor PGL solubility in higher pH environments.
These ﬁndings highlight the potential of ﬁsh oil-based PGL-SMEDDS as an advanced option for improving the oral bioavailability of pioglitazone while harnessing the syner- gistic effects of ﬁsh oil in improving insulin resistance and reducing potential side effects associated with PGL. Future studies investi- gating the synergistic pharmacological effects of ﬁsh oil-based PGL-SMEDDS on rats are highly recommended.Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnan- cial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inﬂuence the work reported in this paper.Funding Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Sup- porting Project number (PNURSP2023R141), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Thankful also to Researchers Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R732), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
