Hyperbilirubinemia and these phenomena do, however, have a relationship. According to many clinical studies, elevated blood bilirubin and low vitamin E (VE) levels in newborns are associated.The aim of the study was to investigate the association of oxidative stress of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in patients who underwent phototherapy with additional vitamin E supplementation (25 mg/kg/day over the course of three days) and patients without additional vita- min E.Material and methods: A set of 100 neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia patients was enrolled at neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of the pediatric departments at Al Azhar University Hospitals during the period from February 2021 to October 2022 after obtaining signed written informed consent of all neonates’ parents with an explanation of the aim of study.Results: Significant differences were found between the studied groups regarding serum bilirubin on the third day of admission (p = 0.039).
Patients who were treated with vitamin E had lower serum bilirubin on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) than the control group (11.66 ±3.22). Also, among the VE group, serum bilirubin was significantly decreased on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) compared to zero days of admission (14.10 ±4.39) (p = 0.041).Conclusions: Vitamin E supplementation has an important role in treatment of indirect hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.Early administration of vitamin E in preterm neonates resulted in a significant decrease of serum bilirubin and increased total antioxidant capacity.Vitamin E supplementation in full term decreased the duration of phototherapy.Key words: hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal, oxidative stress, total antioxidant capacity, vitamin E.Address for correspondence: Mohamed Z.H.

Between 8% and 11% of newborns experience hyperbilirubinemia.During the first week of life, when the total serum bili-rubin (TSB) rises over the 95 th percentile for age (high- risk zone) it is considered hyperbilirubinemia [2].It is typical for idiopathic neonatal jaundice to occur in 60% to 80% of healthy newborns.A newborn’s skin and sclera turn yellowish due to neonatal jaundice, which is caused by bilirubin [3].
A high serum level of free bilirubin may cause neu- rotoxicity, but mildly increased bilirubin concentra- tions are beneficial due to their protective antioxidant role in cells of membranes, while markedly decreased concentrations may also be harmful [4]. Although the amount of free bilirubin in the serum is reduced during the treatment of newborn hyperbilirubinemia, this may lessen the protective impact of bilirubin on the cell membrane, making the cell membrane vulnerable to damage and leading to cell apoptosis [5].Overex-pression of the BAX gene, which encourages apoptosis brought on by phototherapy, and the oxidative stress brought on by phototherapy may both be responsible for this damage [6].Vitamin E plays a vital role in the natural metab- olism of all cells and acts in conjunction with other nutrients and endogenous factors which could form a protective system against the destructive effects of reactive oxygen species [7].
Vitamin E is a crucial part of the cellular antioxidant defense system and partic- ipates in a few different antioxidant enzyme systems, including glutathione reductase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and thioredoxin reductase [8]. By making red blood cells less susceptible to auto- xidation processes, vitamin E appears to be able to stop physiological hemolysis and lower bilirubin formation [9].Various clinical studies have revealed a connection between elevated blood bilirubin and lower vitamin E levels in newborns [10].Oxidative stress occurs because of the imbalance between oxidant products and antioxidant systems [11].Free radicals, or molecules with unpaired elec- trons, are molecules that are produced during meta-bolic redox reactions in response to hypoxic or hyper - oxic conditions, ischemia-reperfusion, inflammation, immune response activation, mitochondrial dysfunc-tion, and the Fenton reaction.
They include reactive oxygen, nitric, carbonic, and sulfuric species [12].Antioxidants can neutralize or eliminate free rad- icals, preventing tissue damage from oxidative stress, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, vitamins C and E, minerals, and gluta- thione (GSH) [13]. Both term and preterm newborns produce more free radicals as a result of the birth’s abrupt increase in oxygen concentration since they are unable to counterbalance this burden [14].Due to the limited antioxidant capacity, which is mostly developed during the latter stages of pregnancy, as well as the immaturity of the antioxidant production system, premature babies are especially susceptible to the harm caused by oxidative stress [15].Unconjugated idiopathic hyperbilirubinemia in newborns has been linked to the oxidative break- down of red blood cells [16].Hypoxia and acidosis in the fetus and infant have been linked to the mecha-nisms of oxidative damage.
It has been demonstrated that children who develop idiopathic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia have decreased levels of erythro- cyte antioxidant enzymes due to the damaging effects of circulating oxidants that are not counterbalanced by appropriate antioxidant systems [12]. So, the aim of the study was to investigate the association of oxi-dative stress in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and vita- min E supplementation.To this end, we investigated the association of oxidative stress in neonatal patients with hyperbilirubinemia who underwent photo- therapy with additional vitamin E supplementation (25 mg/kg/day of over the course of three days) com- pared to patients without additional vitamin E.
Material and methods A set of 100 neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia patients was enrolled at neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of the pediatric departments at Al Azhar University Hospitals during the period from Febru-ary 2020 to October 2022 after obtaining signed writ- ten informed consent of all neonates’ parents with an explanation of the aim of study. The protocol of this study was approved by the ethical committee of Al Azhar University, Faculty of Medicine (IRB ID: AZ- pedia2020-19).All studied neonates were divided into two groups: • Group VE (cases) included 50 newborns with indi- rect hyperbilirubinemia who underwent photother - apy and were given 25 mg/kg/day of vitamin E over the course of three days commencing on the first day of admission; • Group C (control) included 50 people receiving pho-totherapy without additional vitamin E who had in- direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Clinical and Experimental Hepatology 1/202432 Mohamed Zaeim Hafez Ahmed, Reham Helmy Amin Helmy Saad, Ahmad Gadalla, et al.Inclusion criteria: neonatal indirect hyperbiliru- binemia in both sexes. Exclusion criteria: neonatal direct hyperbilirubinemia in both sexes, signs of neo-natal sepsis, and neonatal abnormalities (congenital, chromosomal…).All neonates admitted to the NICU were subjec- ted to: • Full history taking including name, age, sex, mode of delivery, gestational age (weeks), nutrition status, factors that might lead to sepsis such as premature rupture of membranes, maternal fever, and vaginal discharge.• Jaundice in a prior sibling, RH or ABO incompa- rability, and a history of chronic hemolytic anemia in the family that manifested in the neonatal stage.Full clinical examination including vital data (heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature).
Anthropo-metric measurements including weight, body weight loss/g, length, body mass index, head circumference and abdominal circumference. Complete systemic examination including gastrointestinal, chest, cardi- ac and neurological.Complete blood count (CBC) including hemoglobin level (Hb), white blood cells count (WBCs), platelet count using Sysmex KX-21 automatized hematology analyzer (Sysmex corpora-tion, Japan) [17].Reticulocyte count using Brilliant Cresyl blue stain (Supravital stain).Serum bilirubin (total and direct) using the automated Coombs test (Cobas C 111) (Roche).Also, serum C-reactive pro-tein (CRP) using the latex serology test.Regarding total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were mea- sured by Erel’s TAC method.
In this study, the total blood bilirubin level was measured, and the results were compared before beginning phototherapy, on the first, second, and third days of phototherapy, and 24 hours after ceasing phototherapy.Histopathological investigations Blood samples were collected to conduct histo- pathological analyses. Using 10-milliliter syringes, blood was drawn into potassium-EDTA tubes (10.5 mg/ 7 ml).In a chilled centrifuge, blood samples were spun for five minutes at 3000 rpm.The plasma and buffy coat were disposed of.After a 1/10 dilution, packed RBCs were cleaned twice with normal saline to get rid of any leftover leukocytes and plasma components.All reagents were analytical grade.Hexane, 2-thiobarbi-turic acid (TBA), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were obtained from Merck Chemical Company (Darmstadt, Germany).Histopathological investigations indicated that the hemolyzed RBC counts increased in the control group, while vitamin E treatment reduced the hemolyzed RBC count.
In the control group, histology of RBCs was normal (Fig. 1A).In the control group, there were remarkable membrane destruction and hemolytic changes in RBCs (Fig.1B), while in the vitamin VE treated group, these changes were smaller than in the control group (Fig.1C).Morphological evaluation Using sterile potassium-EDTA tubes to collect blood samples.Giemsa solution was used to stain the blood smears, which were created by spreading one drop of blood onto a slide just after the tubes were inverted and mixed with blood.Using an oil immersion 100/1.25 objective on a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope (Tokyo, Japan), the morphology of RBCs was ascertained.Image analysis A PC system with hardware and software (Im- age-Pro Plus 5.0-Media Cybernetics, USA) was used A B C Fig.1.A) In control group, the morphology of normal RBCs in normal neonates (arrow: normal RBCs, Giemsa; 1150×).

[18], extensive photo- therapy requires two or more lights and uses special-ized blue lamps with a peak output at 425-475 nm, known as the most effective for phototherapy. To pro- vide maximum light exposure across the largest pos- sible screen surface area, newborns under photother - apy lights were kept naked aside from eye patches and a face mask used as a diaper.The children were rotat- ed every two hours.When the risk factors for toxicity were eliminated, the baby was old enough to tolerate the bilirubin burden, and the bilirubin level was low enough to no longer raise concerns about toxic effects, phototherapy should be discontinued [18].Statistical analysis Statistical computations were analyzed using SPSS Statistics (SPSS, 25th edition, IBM, New Y ork, USA) for Microsoft Windows 10.
Two types of statistics were conducted: descriptive statistics that includes the fol- lowing test as the description of data was in the form of mean (±) SD, median, and range for quantitively data, and frequency and proportion for qualitative data and analytical statistics using Student’s t-test (t), the paired t test, and the Mann-Whitney test (U) for the quantita- tive variables, and the chi-square (χ 2) test was used for the qualitative variables. A p value < 0.05 was consid- ered significant.Results A flowchart of the study population is shown in Figure 2.In all, 117 neonates with indirect hyperbiliru-binemia were enrolled at neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of the pediatric departments at Al Azhar University Hospitals during the period from February 2021 to October 2022.Nine neonates were excluded from the study (2 patients’ parents declined consent and 7 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria).
108 patients were divided into two groups: Group VE (vitamin E; neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia was treated with phototherapy and vitamin E at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day for three days in a row beginning on the day of arrival, n = 56) and Group C (control; neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia while receiving photo-therapy without additional vitamin E, n = 52). Eight neonates were excluded due to serological conflict manifesting as sepsis, hypersplenism, or bone marrow depression (6 cases from Group VE and 2 cases from Group C) (Fig.2).

There were no statistically significant differences between the studied groups regarding heart rate (p = 0.960), re-spiratory rate (p = 0.750) and temperature (p = 0.858) (Table 2).Phototherapy exposure was statistically sig- nificantly lower among VE cases (75.9 ±8.95) than controls (94.70 ±15.42) with a p-value = 0.004 (Fig.3).There were no statistically significant differences between the studied groups regarding hemoglobin (p = 0.733), total leucocyte count (p = 0.080), platelets (p = 0.056) and C-reactive protein (p = 1.00) (Table 3).
There were statistically significant differences be- tween the studied groups regarding total antioxidant capacity on the third day of admission (p = 0.003). Patients treated with vitamin E had higher total anti-oxidant capacity on the third day of admission (0.97 ±0.42) than control group (0.95 ±0.38).Also, among the VE group, total antioxidant capacity was signifi-cantly increased on the third day of admission (2.75 ±0.67) compared to zero days of admission (0.97 ±0.42) (p < 0.001) (Table 4).There were statistically significant differences be- tween the studied groups regarding serum bilirubin on the third day of admission (p = 0.039).Patients treated with vitamin E had lower serum bilirubin on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) than the control group (11.66 ±3.22).Also, among VE cases, serum bilirubin was significantly decreased on the third day of admis-sion (8.25 ±3.41) compared to zero days of admission (14.10 ±4.39) (p = 0.041) (Table 5, Fig.4).

Our results agree with Stevenson et al .[19], who reported that infants in the vitamin E-treat- ed group had a male : female ratio of 12 : 7, a mean birth weight of 1272 g, and a mean gestational age of 29 weeks.The M : F ratio in the control group was 11%, and the differences between the vitamin E-treated and control-treated groups were not statistically significant.The control group’s mean birth weight was 1214 g, and its mean gestational age was 29 weeks.Another study was done by Abdul-Razzak et al .[20], who studied the correlation between full-term newborns’ hyperbiliru-binemia severity and plasma vitamin E and C levels.
In 119 newborns who did not develop hyperbilirubin- emia and 11 neonates who did develop substantial hy-perbilirubinemia, the concentrations of the vitamins E and C in the blood were evaluated on the first day of life. There was no discernible difference between the two groups’ gestational ages and birth weights.Also, El Mashad et al .[21] evaluated the impact of vitamin E supplementation in the management of secondary hy-perbilirubinemia in newborns receiving phototherapy.They discovered that statistical examination of the data revealed no statistically significant differences between the vitamin E supplementation group and the con- trol group in terms of age, sex, or body weight.This suggests that the cases were carefully chosen.Thiaga- rajan et al .[22] assessed neonates who were receiving phototherapy for newborn jaundice and their oxida-tive stress.
They discovered that there were 26 males and 14 females among the controls and 25 males and 15 females among the neonates who were enrolled as cases. The two groups’ distributions of age and sex were comparable.In the current study, treated patients had signifi- cantly lower exposure to phototherapy than the con-trol group.These results are in agreement with the re-sults obtained by Gross [23], who studied 20 neonates with a birth weight of 2500-3500 g.The vitamin E sup- plemented group also experienced significantly short- er phototherapy sessions.These disparities were not as noticeable in newborns who weighed more than 2500 g at birth.Also, these results are in agreement with Akisü et al .[24], who needed 72 hours of continuous phototherapy to assess the antioxidant defense system in neonates undergoing phototherapy.They found no significant change in serum levels of vitamin E before and 72 hours after the phototherapy.
On the other hand, our results disagree with Hadjigeorgiou et al . [25], who studied 11 full-term infants with jaundice who received phototherapy and had their serum vita-min E levels measured and compared to 10 full-term jaundiced control children.They discovered that no alterations were seen prior to, during, or one week af- ter quitting phototherapy.Regarding the values of mi- crohematocrit, hemoglobin, and reticulocytes, the two groups of babies both showed poor outcomes.In our study, no statistical differences were found between the studied groups regarding CBC includ-ing hemoglobin, TLC, platelet, and CRP .These results agree with Westergren and Betty [26], who found that in both control-supplemented and vitamin E-supple- mented groups, hemoglobin levels between the two groups did not significantly differ at any point in time.
A control-supplemented infant also attained vitamin E adequacy and a decline in bilirubin generation by day 7 of life; vitamin E supplementation considerably in- creases vitamin E levels. Ferlin et al .[27], however, re- ported that since this supplementation did not change hemoglobin levels, the prophylactic or therapeutic use of vitamin E, 25 IU/day, had no impact on early ane- mia of preterm.Also, Hadjigeorgiou et al .[25] found no differences before or after phototherapy or 1 week after stopping it.The same negative results were noted in the two groups of infants about the values of mi- crohematocrit, hemoglobin, and reticulocytes.On the other hand, Gross et al .[23] found from day 3 to day 8 that the treatment group’s mean percent carboxyhe-moglobin level dramatically decreased (1.08-0.78%), whereas the control group’s mean value stayed con- stant at 0.96%.Vitamin supplementation appears to slow down but not stop the rapid red cell death that is unique to preterm infants.
Similarly, Abdul-Razzak et al . [20] found that neonates with hyperbilirubin- emia had considerably decreased hemoglobin and he-matocrit levels.The study done by Abd El Wahed et al.[28] found that preterm neonates may benefit from re-ceiving additional vitamin E supplements as vitamin E may be able to prevent or reduce some preterm com-plications.Fig.4.Serum bilirubin distribution among the studied neonates35 3025 20 1510 5 0 VE cases ControlsMean value (h) At admission 3rd day of admission8.25 14.111.66 14.7 Clinical and Experimental Hepatology 1/202437 Oxidative stress of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and vitamin E supplementationOur patients treated with phototherapy had de- creased serum bilirubin on the third day of admission and had a higher rate of bilirubin decline than con-trol group.Also, serum bilirubin on the third day of admission was significantly lower than at zero days of admission.These results agreed with those obtained by Gross et al .
[23], who found that vitamin E-treat- ed newborns who had birth weights under 2500 g showed a substantial reduction in serum bilirubin on day 3 of life as well as a significant reduction in peak serum bilirubin over the first week of life. Our finding is also like that of Kaplan et al .[29], who concluded that vitamin E deficiency may be the cause of the sig-nificant hyperbilirubinemia and enhanced hemolysis seen in newborn jaundice.These results agreed with those obtained by Ojo et al .[30], who observed a sig- nificant decrease plasma vitamin E level in full-term neonates associated with an increase in bilirubin level and red blood cell hemolysis.These results agree with Fischer et al .[31], who found that each neonate’s se- rum total bilirubin levels were measured on the first and third study days, and there was a favorable link between those levels and vitamin E administration.
In contrast, our results disagree with Westergren and Bet-ty [26], who found that when compared to day 1, vita-min E levels were significantly higher on days 3 and 7. On day 3 compared to day 1, neither group’s bilirubin production differed considerably.However, by day 7, both groups’ bilirubin production had decreased dra-matically compared to day 1.At any given moment, there were no appreciable variations in the two groups’ serum bilirubin levels.A control-supplemented infant also attained vitamin E adequacy and a decline in bili-rubin generation by day 7 of life; vitamin E supplemen- tation considerably increases vitamin E levels.Mean- while, Dani et al .[32] found in preterm newborns that lower plasma bilirubin levels were associated with lower plasma antioxidant capacity and higher levels of oxidative stress.These observations could result from heme oxygenase’s pro-oxidant activity brought on by the release of iron.Another study by Thiagarajan et al .
[22] found that mean total serum bilirubin levels were 10.13 ±2.47 mg/dl for controls, 17.85 ±1.82 mg/dl for cases in the pre-phototherapy study group, and 15.19 ±1.56 mg/dl for cases in the post-phototherapy study group. It demonstrates that phototherapy treatment dramatically reduced the level of total serum bilirubin.Similarly, El Mashad et al .[21] found there were no differences in serum bilirubin levels on days 1 or 3 be- tween the groups receiving vitamin E and the con-trol group.On days 1 and 3, they continued to notice no variations in serum bilirubin levels.The findings of their study indicate that in premature newborns weighing less than 1500 g at birth, supplementary oral vitamin E therapy had no appreciable impact on bili-rubin generation during the first three days of life.Our patients treated with vitamin E had higher TAC on the third day of admission than control group.Also, TAC on the third day of admission was signifi- cantly higher than at zero days of admission.
Also, the treated group had a significantly higher rate of TAC in- crease than the control group. These results agree with those obtained by Abd El Wahed et al .[28], who found that preterm neonates may benefit from receiving ad-ditional vitamin E supplements as vitamin E may be able to prevent or reduce some preterm complications.Also, El Mashad et al .[21] found that in the groups under study, there was no appreciable difference in TSB upon admission.This suggests careful case selec- tion.However, the studied groups’ TSBs at discharge showed a highly significant difference.When com- pared to group III, which received only phototherapy, group I, which received 25 mg/kg/day of oral vitamin E along with phototherapy, had significantly higher TSB at discharge; however, there was no discernible dif- ference between group II, which received 50 mg/kg/ day of oral vitamin E along with phototherapy, and groups II and III.
Conclusions In conclusion, vitamin E supplementation has an important role in treatment of indirect hyperbiliru-binemia. Early administration of vitamin E in preterm neonates resulted in a significant decrease of serum bilirubin and increased total antioxidant capacity.Vi-tamin E supplementation in full term decreases dura-tion of phototherapy.Further investigational studies about the role of vitamin E on pathological hyperbil-irubinemia are needed.Future studies are needed to examine preterm and term neonates separately with larger sample sizes.Disclosure The authors declare no conflict of interest.References 1.Tsehay B, Afework M.The burden of pathological neonatal jaundice and its determinants in Ethiopia: Systematic review and meta-analysis.J Neonatol 2023; 09732179231164520.2.Thanomsingh P .Clinical predictive score of predischarge screening for severe hyperbilirubinemia in late preterm and term infants.Pediatr Neonatol 2020; 61: 378-384.3.Abd Elmoktader A, Hussein S, Boraik M.
