RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Skill execution and sleep deprivation: effects of acute caffeine or creatine supplementation - arandomized placebo-controlled trial Christian J Cook1,3,4* †, Blair T Crewther3†, Liam P Kilduff2†, Scott Drawer1†, Chris M Gaviglio5† Abstract Background: We investigated the effects of sleep deprivation with or without acute supplementation of caffeine or creatine on the execution of a repeated rugby passing skill.Method: Ten elite rugby players completed 10 trials on a simple rugby passing skill test (20 repeats per trial), following a period of familiarisation.The players had between 7-9 h sleep on 5 of these trials and between 3-5 h sleep (deprivation) on the other 5.At a time of 1.5 h before each trial, they undertook administration of either: placebo tablets, 50 or 100 mg/kg creatine, 1 or 5 mg/kg caffeine.Saliva was collected before each trial and assayedfor salivary free cortisol and testosterone.
Results: Sleep deprivation with placebo application resulted in a significant fall in skill performance accuracy on both the dominant and non-dominant passing sides (p < 0.001). No fall in skill performance was seen with caffeine doses of 1 or 5 mg/kg, and the two doses were not significantly different in effect.Similarly, no deficit was seen with creatine administration at 50 or 100 mg/kg and the performance effects were not significantly different.Salivary testosterone was not affected by sleep deprivation, but trended higher with the 100 mg/kg creatine dose, compared to the placebotreatment (p = 0.067).Salivary cortisol was elevated (p = 0.001) with the 5 mg/kg dose of caffeine (vs.placebo).Conclusion: Acute sleep deprivation affects performance of a simple repeat skill in elite athletes and this was ameliorated by a single dose of either caffeine or creatine.
Acute creatine use may help to alleviate decrements in skill performance in situations of sleep deprivation, such as transmeridian travel, and caffeine at low doses appears as efficacious as higher doses, at alleviating sleep deprivation deficits in athletes with a history of low caffeine use. Both options are without the side effects of higher dose caffeine use.Background Both creatine and caffeine have found common use in sport [1-4] for a variety of training and competitive aims.Popular use of caffeine is often at high concentrations (4-9 mg/kg) on the basis that these are more efficacious, but the proof of this is low with individual variability andconsumption habits being the more dominant factors[5,6].
In contrast, popular creatine supplementation dosages appear to have fallen as literature supports thecontention that lower doses can be as effective as higherloading schemes, again individual variability and respon-siveness being major determinants [4].While the ability of acute caffeine to address cognitive related sleep deficits is reasonably established [7], it is onlyrecently that creatine has demonstrated similar properties[8,9]. It has been suggested that sleep deprivation is asso- ciated with an acute reduction in high energy phosphates that in turn produces some degree of cognitive processingdeficit [8-14].
Creatine supplementation has been shownto improve certain aspects of cognitive performance withsleep deprivation and to have some positive benefits indeficits associated with certain pathophysiologies [13,14].If sleep deprivation is associated with an energy deficitthen errors in performance are perhaps more likely to occur when concentration demands are high and/or for prolonged periods of repeated task execution. Some evi-dence suggests that it is tasks of this nature that are mostaffected by acute sleep deprivation [15].* Correspondence: Christian.cook@uksport.gov.uk †Contributed equally 1UK Sport Council, 40 Bernard St London, UK Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleCook et al .Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2011, 8:2 http://www.jissn.com/content/8/1/2 © 2011 Cook et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Creatine has generally only been used in chronic load- ing protocols.However, if the contention that acute sleep deprivation reduces brain creatine is true, than anacute dose of creatine, as opposed to the classical longerloading periods, may alleviate some of these effects.Thiswould be dependent on creatine uptake not being rate limited, something unknown for the brain.Creatine does however readily cross the blood brain barrier andchronic systemic loading does appear to increase brainstores [13,14].
Acute doses of caffeine appear most ben-eficial at around 30-90 min prior performance [16] andwhile the timing of an acute dose of creatine has yet tobe determined, it appears to take at least an hour forabsorption into the bloodstream [17-19]. Sleep deprivation is not uncommon around competi- tion in sport particularly with the frequent demands ofinternational travel.Assessing its effects on performanceis however difficult, especially in team sports wheremultiple physical and skill components are involved.While overt physical components such as power don ’t appear affected by acute deprivation [20] a few studiesdo however suggest acute deprivation can affect certain sport skill and physical performance [21,22].
Given the potential usefulness of safe supplementation for alleviating cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation, this study aimed to investigate if acute admin-istration of creatine or caffeine could offer this advantage.To this end, we tested the effects of acute occurring sleepdeprivation on a fundamental rugby skill, passing the ballwhile running with accuracy, in elite level players. Further to this, we tested if acute administration of creatine or caf- feine would in any way alter this performance.Method Subjects Ten professional rugby backs (mean ± SD, age; 20 ± 0.5years) that were in good health and injury-free volun-teered for this trial.Subject bodyweights were 90 ± 4 kg and heights 1.81 ± 0.02 m (mean ± SD).Bodyweights showed no significant changes over the course of thistrial.A within-treatment design was used with each sub-ject acting as their own control to improve reliabilityand the sensitivity of measurements.
Subjects allreported a low and infrequent history of both previouscaffeine use (in any form) and each had used creatinepreviously, usually in a classic loading protocol. The ath- letes were all very low and infrequent social consumers of alcohol.A university ethics committee approved thestudy procedures and each subject signed an informedconsent form before participation.Study design A blinded, repeated measure, placebo-controlled cross-over design was used to examine the effects of acutesupplementation (caffeine or creatine) on the executionof a repeated rugby passing skill during sleep deprivation.Testing procedures On days of testing the subjects consumed the samebreakfast which consisted of a bowl of cereal with fruit, yoghurt and milk in a portion of voluntary choice and two poached eggs on one piece of buttered toast con-sumed between 0700 h and 0800 h.Water was availablead libitum.
On the night previous to testing food wasnot strictly controlled but all subjects reported consum-ing a dinner of at least red meat and 3 vegetables and alatter evening protein milkshake. Initially all 10 players in this study undertook 3 weeks of familiarisation training on a rugby-specific passing skill (total of 12 sessions).Changes in performance andvariability were calculated over these sessions.Familiari-sation was undertaken at 1130 h each time, andrequired 2 previous nights of greater than 7 h sleep tobe performed (i.e.clearly non-sleep deprived).Followingfamiliarisation the players were asked to keep a sleeplog to record the number of hours slept per night.This was reported at 0900 h on Monday to Friday.
The skill testing procedures were performed on 10 separate occasions across a 10 week period (not less than three days apart) at 1130 h, with between 7-9 h sleep fortwo nights preceding five of these tests, and with 3- 5 hsleep (sleep deprived) on the night preceding (but morethan 7 h on the previous night) on the other 5 trials. At1000 h on the test days the athletes received one of the following: placebo tablets (sucrose at 5 mg/kg); creatine monohydrate tablets (50 or 100 mg/kg bodyweight); caf-feine tablets (1 or 5 mg/kg bodyweight).Thus, the abso-lute mean dosages of creatine used were 4.5 g and 9 g,respectively, and caffeine dosages of 90 mg and 450 mgwere respectively used.The doses were divided into 5tablets, of same size based upon each individual athlete ’s bodyweight at the start of the trial, across all treatments.Maize starch was used where necessary to balance out tablet weights and tablets were hand made using gelatinecapsules.
Treatment (blinded) was randomised acrossathletes and the skill execution tests. On all trials subjects refrained from alcohol consump- tion for at least 48 h prior to testing and from any caf-feine and caffeine containing drinks for at least 24 h(athletes were infrequent caffeine drinkers).The athletes r e c r u i t e dh a dn o tu s e dc r e a t i n eo rc r e a t i n e - b a s e ds u p - plements within the preceding 3 months of this study.Rugby passing skill test The repeated rugby passing skill was performed indoorsand consisted of: a 20 m sprint in which at the 10 mmark the player had to attempt to pass a rugby ball leftor right (alternating) through a hanging hoop (diameterCook et al .Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2011, 8:2 http://www.jissn.com/content/8/1/2Page 2 of 8 1.5 m) 10 m away from them.Players were also asked to identify their better passing side (dominant).
All 10players clearly believed they had a better passing side,and this was supported by alternate accuracy. The 20 mprotocol had to be completed in less than 20 s (beeptimed for the players) and they undertook 20 repeats (10 passes on each side) with a walk back recovery period.Execution success was simply defined as the num-ber of successful attempts on the dominant and non-dominant side.The elite group of athletes were familiarwith this common rugby skill and thus, a high level ofreliability was expected.To further ensure high test-retestreliability, three weeks of fa miliarization sessions were also performed before the main testing procedures.Saliva measures Saliva was collected immediately before each trial as fol-lows: players provided a passive drool of saliva into ster-ile containers (LabServe, NewZealand) approximately2 ml over a timed collection period (2 min).
The salivasamples were aliquoted into two separate sterile con-tainers (LabServe, New Zealand) and stored at - 80°C until assay. Samples were analysed in duplicate using commercial kits (Salimetrics LLC, USA) and the manu-facturers ’guidelines.The minimu m detection limit for the testosterone assay was 2 pg/ml with intra- andinter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of 1.2 -12.7%.T h ec o r t i s o la s s a yh a dad e t ection limit of 0.3 ng/ml with intra- and inter-assay CV of 2.6 - 9.8%.Statistical Analyses The accuracy of skill execution with sleep deprivationand treatments was examined using a two-way analysisof variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on both thedominant and non-dominant passing sides.A two-wayrepeated measures ANOVA was also used to evaluatethe effects of sleep state, treatments and any interactionsfor each hormonal variable.
In addition, dominant versus non-dominant side skill performance during familiarisa- tion trials and non-deprived performance versus famil-iarisation performance wer e examined similarly. The Tukey HSD test was used as the post hoc procedurewhere appropriate.Significance was set at an alpha levelof p≤0.05.Results Familiarisation training and dominant versus non- dominant passing side A significant main effect for skill performance was identi- fied over time [ F(5, 108) = 38.44, p < 0.001].Skill execution on both sides improved significantly (p < 0.001) across thefirst 5 sessions (Table 1) and then was unchanged betweensession 5 and 12.Variability within an individual on non-sleep deprived days was less than 5% and, betweenindividuals in the group, was less than 15% and no signifi-cant differences were seen.
A significant main effect wasalso identified for passing side [ F(1, 108) = 53.85, p < 0.001] with dominant side skill execution found to besuperior to the non-dominan t side across all trials (p = 0.013). No interactions between passing side and time werefound [ F(5, 108) = 1.899, p = 0.1].Placebo non-sleep deprived versus familiarisation Placebo administration on non-sleep deprived days did notproduce a significantly different performance result to thatseen in the last familiarisation trial [ F(1, 36) = 0.00, p = 1.0], but a significant main effect was identified for passingside skill execution, this being consistently higher on thedominant side than the non-dominant side [ F(1, 36) = 22.737, p < 0.001].No significant interactions were identi- fied for these variables [ F(1, 36) = 0.00, p = 1.0].
Placebo versus creatine or caffeine on dominant passing side Repeated analyses revealed significant main effects for treatment condition [ F(4, 90) = 19.303, p < 0.001], sleep state [ F(1, 90) = 19.472, p < 0.001] and their interactions [F(4, 90) = 7.978, p < 0.001] on the dominant passing side (Figure 1). All of the caffeine and creatine dosesproduce a significant enhancement in skill performancewhen compared to placebo administration (p < 0.001).In the placebo condition, passing skill performance wasfound to be superior in the non-sleep deprived than thesleep deprived trial (p < 0.001).Placebo versus creatine or caffeine on non-dominant passing side On the non-dominant passing side (Figure 2), significant main effects were identified for the treatment conditions[F(4, 90) = 14.871, p < 0.001], sleep state [ F(1, 90) = 18.228, p < 0.001], and their interactions [ F(4, 90) = 6.026, p < 0.001].
As with the dominant passing side, allof the caffeine and creatine doses produce a significantenhancement in skill performance from the placebo (p < 0.001) and, in the placebo condition, greater perfor- mance accuracy was noted in the non-sleep deprived(vs. sleep deprived) trial (p < 0.001).Figures 1 and 2 summarise this data.Table 1 Accuracy, out of 10 attempts (20 total per trial), for each of dominant and non-dominant passing sides onthe first, fifth and twelve familiarisation trials 1stTrial 5thTriala12thTriala Dominant 7.3 ± 0.8 9.0 ± 0.7 9.0 ± 0.4 Non-dominantb5.7 ± 0.8 8.3 ± 0.8 8.2 ± 0.7 Data presented as mean ± SD.

There wereno significant effects of sleep state [ F(1, 90) = 1.602, p = 0.209], nor any interactions [ F(4, 90) = 1.014, p = 0.405], on salivary testoster one.For salivary cortisol (Figure 4), significant res ults were noted for the main effects of treatment [ F(4, 90) = 8.415, p < 0.001] and sleep state [ F(1, 90) = 31.31, p < 0.001], but there were no interactions [ F(4, 90) = 0.691, p = 0.6].
Cortisol was significantly higher wit ht h e5m gc a f f e i n ed o s e( p= 0.001) than the placebo treatment. Figures 3 and 4 summarise this data.Discussion Acute sleep deprivation is a common occurrence in the general population [23] incl uding elite athletes.Such deprivation has been shown to affect some, but not all, physical and skill executions [15,20-22].However, quan-tifying an effect in a team sport can be difficult.Therepeated passing skill test we described herein is simpleto perform, has sport-specific relevance and appears tobe highly reliable across repeat testing.It is not howevera one off, high-level performance task, rather a repeat of20 fairly simple tasks, alternating passing sides.Whilewe don’ t claim it to be in any way, yet, a valid perfor- mance measure it did reveal some interesting differencesacross acute sleep deprivation and across caffeine andcreatine treatments.
In line with observations in other skill and psychomo- tor testing acute sleep deprivation reduced the accuracyover repeated trials. There was a general trend to adrop-off in accuracy latter in the repeats (second 10 ofthe 20 repeats).Whether this is a greater susceptibilityto mental fatigue or not remains an interesting question,as does whether single skill repeats separated by morerecovery time or by a similar physical activity with no real skill requirement would show a deficit in perfor- mance or not.In non-sport related psychomotor trialst h e r ei sl i t t l ee v i d e n c et h a tas i n g l ee p i s o d eo fs l e e pdeprivation produces significant deficit in a single task[15]; however across repeat tasks it is perceived thatmuch greater effort is needed to maintain concentration[24].Figure 1 Effects of sleep deprivation and acute supplementations on passing accuracy (dominant side) .
The mean ± SD is displayed for accuracy out of 10 passes on the dominant side (20 passes total per trial) for the 10 subjects under different treatment conditions (placebo; 1 or 5 mg/kg caffeine, 50 or 100 mg/kg creatine) either in non-sleep deprived or sleep deprived states. Dominant was chosen by the subjects as the side they believed showed better passing accuracy.All subjects completed 20 repetitions of the passing skill per trial, alternating passing sides (10 on dominant side).With placebo treatment sleep deprivation was associated with a significant fall in performance (a) (p < 0.001) comparedto non-sleep deprivation.
The 50 and 100 mg/kg creatine and 1 and 5 mg/kg caffeine doses were all associated with a significantly betterperformance (b) (p < 0.001) than the placebo conditions.Cook et al .Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2011, 8:2 http://www.jissn.com/content/8/1/2Page 4 of 8 Acute sleep deprivation has little effect on weightlift- ing performance [20], but can influence mood negatively [24] which may be a driving feature in mental perfor-mance changes. Caffeine, for example, has been shownto improve both mood and mental function followingsleep deprivation [25].It is not known how much mood and other cognitive function, particularly motivation on repeat skill tasks, interact.At the doses and administra-tion time of caffeine use in this study we saw no evi-dence of an effect in non-sleep deprived subjects;however, there was a clear amelioration of skill perfor-mance deficit from the sleep-deprived trials with pla-cebo administration.
The psychostimulant effects ofcaffeine appear to be related to the pre and post synap- tic brakes that adenosine imposes on dopaminergic neu- rotransmission by acting on different adenosine receptorheteromers [26], although numerous mechanisms arelikely to be involved. We did not see a dose related effect with caffeine sup- plementation, with 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg producingsimilar effects, nor did we see high individual variance(i.e.responders and non-responders).The absorption of caffeine in plasma following consumption has been esti- mated at between 30 and 90 min with half life of severalhours [16], so the time between consumption and test-ing (90 min) in this study may have been too long tosee all effects of differing caffeine dose, or any effect onnon-sleep deprived performance.Nonetheless, at 90 minthere was still clear evidence of a reduction in the effectof sleep deprivation on the skill measured and no evi- dence this was different between the 1 and 5 mg/kg dose.
Subjectively, a number of the subjects reported feeling slightly nauseous and anxious following the 5, but not 1,mg/kg administration of caffeine suggesting in otherways there were dose differences. Effective doses of caf-feine (and their dose response nature) remain conten-tious in literature [1,5,6,27] possibly reflecting larger inter-subject variability in responses and different sensi-tivities of various physical and behavioural expressions.The subjects in this study were not regular caffeineusers so arguably may have been more sensitive tolower doses than would be seen in more regular consu-mers.Certainly in the study herein 1 mg/kg was aseffective as 5 mg/kg and from a practical perspectiveruns less risk of undesirable dose related side effects.Chronic creatine supplementation has been shown to address certain aspects of sleep deprivation linked Figure 2 Effects of sleep deprivation and acute supplementations on passing accuracy (non-dominant side) .
The mean ± SD is displayed for accuracy out of 10 passes on the non-dominant side (20 passes total per trial) for the 10 subjects under different treatment conditions (placebo; 1 or 5 mg/kg caffeine, 50 or 100 mg/kg creatine) either in non-sleep deprived or sleep deprived states. All subjects completed 20 repetitions of the passing skill per trial, alternating passing sides (10 non-dominant side).With placebo treatment sleep deprivation wasassociated with a significant fall in performance (a) (p < 0.001) compared to non-sleep deprivation.The 50 and 100 mg/kg creatine and 1 and 5 mg/kg caffeine doses were all associated with a significantly better performance (b) (p < 0.001) than the placebo conditions.Cook et al .Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2011, 8:2 http://www.jissn.com/content/8/1/2Page 5 of 8 Figure 3 Pre-trial salivary free testosterone (pg/ml) across treatments .
The mean ± SD is displayed for salivary testosterone under different treatment conditions (placebo; 1 or 5 mg/kg caffeine, 50 or 100 mg/kg creatine) either in non-sleep deprived or sleep deprived states. The 100 mg/kg creatine dose was associated with a higher concentration of testosterone (a) (p = 0.067) compared to the placebo treatment.Figure 4 Pre-trial salivary free cortisol (ng/ml) across treatments .The mean ± SD is displayed for salivary cortisol under different treatment conditions (placebo; 1 or 5 mg/kg caffeine, 50 or 100 mg/kg creatine) either in non-sleep deprived or sleep deprived states.
The 5 mg/kg caffeine dose was associated with a significantly higher concentration of cortisol (a) (p = 0.001) compared to the placebo treatment.Cook et al .Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2011, 8:2 http://www.jissn.com/content/8/1/2Page 6 of 8 and other pathophysiology linked cognitive deficits [8,9,11,13,14,19], although very low dose chronic supple-mentation does not appear to improve function in non-sleep deprived healthy subjects [28]. Sleep deprivation isassociated with a reduction in brain stores of phosphocrea-tine [10] and certainly in some disease states depletion of high energy phosphate stores has been measured, asso- ciated with cognitive deficit, and alleviated to some extentby creatine supplementation [ 13,14,29].Interestingly, if there is an energy deficit associated with sleep deprivationthen it seems logical to contend that repeat trials would bemore susceptible than one off tasks.
Our results and indeedother work on sleep deprivation do fit this pattern. If suchdepletion occurs and is acute, it also stands to reason that acute supplementation (as opposed to longer protocols) w o u l da d d r e s sa n ya s s o c i a t e dd e f i c i t( g i v e nt h a tb r a i nuptake is not a time limiting factor).Little, if any, attentionhas been given to acute dosing with creatine, mainlybecause it is assumed that its effects come from a gradualbuild up of stores over time.We demonstrate here that anacute dose of creatine can ameliorate sleep deprived defi-cits in repeat skill performance trials.Again this possibly reflects the repeat nature of the trials and may not be observable in an acute one off mental skill performance.Further in contrast to caffeine administration, the creatine dose of 100 mg/kg appeared to elicit a trendtowards greater effect in skill performance than 50 mg/kgdosing, thereby suggesting po t e n t i a l l yad o s ed e p e n d e n tresponse.
As in the case of caffeine we observed no indi-vidual variability suggestive of responders and non- responders or differential dose susceptibility, and no adverse effects were reported to us by the subjects.Clearly at the level of muscle function there does appearto be a division into responders and non-responders tolonger term supplementation with different creatine pro-tocols [4]. It is possible that this would be similar withlonger term supplementation aimed at skill improvement,or alternatively brain-related creatine stores may operate slightly differently to muscle.Acute sleep deprivation has been demonstrated in some studies to have small disruptive effects on basal hormonal concentrations [30,31].Although salivary cor-tisol appeared to be elevated with sleep deprivation, thisresult did not reach statistical significance.Interestinglythe higher dose of caffeine was associated with signifi-cant elevation in pre-trial cortisol, but not testosterone.
High doses of caffeine have previously been demon- strated to acutely increase cortisol and, to a lesserextent, testosterone [20,32]. Whether such elevationsh a v ea n ys i g n i f i c a n c ei no u t c o m ei su n k n o w n .C o r t i s o lis associated with arousal but also with anxiety [33].Unfortunately we did not concurrently measure salivaryalpha amylase in this study, which may also be a usefulmarker with respect to system arousal [34].Testosteronewas unaffected by sleep deprivation and by all treat-ments except the high dose of creatine, where there wasa trend towards higher concentrations.We do not haveuseful speculation as to why this increase was seen,although it was across all subjects.Still, the increase wasrelatively small in magnitude and we doubt at this stage that it has any real physical or behavioural consequence.As we used saliva measures we cannot rule out somelocal oral cavity artefact effect of creatine.
Free testoster-one levels have, however, been linked to intra-individualvariance in short timeframe muscular power [35], andlong-term creatine supplementation has been reportedas influencing testosterone metabolite pathways [36], sothe observation is perhaps worthy of some follow-up. Little has been published on acute creatine use as it has primarily been regarded as a longer term supple-ment to muscular function gain.In terms of brain andbehavioural function it would appear it have some acuteeffects of value.It is also possible that the observedeffects of caffeine and creatine reported in this andother studies are potentially summative and thus, wouldseem a logical progression for research.Conclusions We observed a significant effect of acute sleep depri-vation on performance (on both dominant and non-dominant passing sides) of a repeat simple skill test inelite rugby players.
The deficit in performance withsleep deprivation was addressed by acute supplementa-tion with either caffeine or creatine. In both cases, the two dosages tested had similar effects on skill perfor- mance.Both may offer practical and viable options priorto training and competition to assist skill performancewhen sleep loss has occurred.Acknowledgements We acknowledge with gratitude the professional athletes that contributed to this study.In part this study was supported by grants (ESPRIT) fromEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council UK and by UK SportCouncil.
