CINV often occurs despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, hampering patients ’willingness tocontinue thechemotherapy regimen. Asanayurvedic medicine, ginger (Zingiber officinale )hasanantiemetic effect byinhibiting serotonin ingastrointestinal nerves andasanNK1 antagonist.Therefore, weaimed toreview oralginger supplementation inchildren with CINV systematically.Systematic searching was performed inJune 2023 from Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and hand searching.Thesearch consisted ofPICO “children chemotherapy ”,“ginger ”,and “CINV incidence ”.Welimited thesearch toonly human studies.Studies thatmeet inclusion andexclusion criteria were included foranalysis.Out of116 studies found with ourselection criteria, four were compatible with inclusion and exclusion criteria.Two studies hadasmall Risk ofBias (RoB), while theothers hadahigh RoB.Allstudies statistically significantly reduced acute anddelayed CINV with thenumber needed totreat (NNT) 2–4.Noadverse effects were reported.
However, these studies stillhadhigh heterogeneity based oncancer treatment, chemotherapy regimen, ginger dosing, andginger processing. Ginger hasthepotential toreduce both theacute anddelayed phases ofCINV inchildren.Additional research employing standardized methodologies isrecommended tovalidate thiseffect.1.Introduction Anestimated 380,000 children arediagnosed with cancer each year.High-income countries have acure rate of80%, while low-middle- income countries have arateof30% [1,2].Childhood cancer burdens thepatient andtheparent ’spsychosocial, lowering thepatient ’squality oflife[3].Moreover, childhood cancer isusually treated aggressively to prevent metastasis andother comorbidities, resulting inhigher costs [4].
Chemotherapy-induced nausea andvomiting (CINV) affects 40–70% ofchildren undergoing chemotherapy, which is2.59 times therisk among adults [5,6].CINV often occurs despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, reducing patients ’motivation tocontinue thechemo- therapy regimen [7].Severe CINV requiring hospitalization and extending hospitalization contributed toincreased costs [8]. Chemotherapy drugs cause CINV inboth acute anddelayed fashion.Theacute phase with higher emesis intensity occurs inthefirst24hafterchemotherapy.
Free radicals generated after chemotherapy stimulate therelease ofserotonin from enterochromaffin cells inthegastrointes- tinal tract [9,10].Serotonin triggers thevomiting reflex byinteracting with 5-HT 3receptors onintestinal vagal afferent nerves thatproject to thepostrema area andnucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) [11].Addition- ally, serotonin may directly interact with 5-HT 3receptors inthepost- rema area [11].Therefore, acute CINV canbetreated with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Two tofivedays after chemotherapy, thedelayed phase may occur.Theinduction ofvomiting indelayed CINV iscaused bythebinding of substance Ptoneurokinin-1 (NK-1) inthepostrema area andNTS, which arereleased from neurons inresponse tochemotherapy [11].Asthe NK-1 receptor plays asignificant roleinthedelayed CINV mechanism, NK-1 antagonists areeffective intheprevention and treatment of delayed CINV [10].

However, thisguideline states thatthenumber ofchildren studied issmall, andfurther studies areneeded [12,13].Furthermore, there isnoguideline available yetfor delayed CINV. Therefore, alternative andadd-on treatments areneeded toreduce children ’sCINV.
Ginger hasbeen used asantiemetic andingastrointestinal disease in Ayurveda forover 25centuries, asdocumented inSushruta Samitha, andover 50centuries back tothetime ofLord Krishna [14,15].InAy- urveda literature, itisusually stated asDeepana (enchancement of appetite) andPachana (enhance digestion) [16].Ginger (zingiberoffici- nale)contains shogaol, zingiberene, gingerol, zingerone, andparadol, which canregulate gastrointestinal motility andinhibit vagal nerves by inhibiting serotonin ingastrointestinal nerves [17,18].Gingerol and shogaol have NK-1 receptor antagonist properties, which reduce delayed CINV based ontheir mechanism [19].Insummary, ginger possesses serotonin-inhibiting properties and NK-1 receptor antagonistic, rendering itapotential treatment foracute and delayed CINV, respectively. Ginger ’smechanism intreating CINV suggests itmay alsobeeffec- tiveinreducing these symptoms inother conditions andgroups, like pregnancy-related nausea andvomiting.
Two outofthree meta-analyses inpregnancy-related nausea andvomiting demonstrated thatginger has astatistically significant effect inreducing nausea, butnotvomiting [20, 21].Another showed thatginger canreduce both nausea andvomiting [22].These results indicate thatginger hasgood potential forreducing nausea andvomiting. Despite thewell-established mechanism, many systematic reviews onadults failed togiveclear conclusions andrecommendations [23–25].Therefore, oursystematic review focused onevaluating theimpact of oral ginger supplementation onreducing theincidence ofCINV in children.2.Materialsandmethods 2.1.Protocol This systematic review was performed according toPreferred Reporting Items forSystematic Reviews andMeta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [26].Thestudy protocol canbeobserved onTheInterna- tional Prospective Register ofSystematic Reviews (PROSPERO) data- base (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023438702 ).
2.2.Searchstrategyandarticleselection Acomprehensive search wasconducted intheelectronic databases Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, andCochrane from their inception until July 2023. Utilized MESH andnonMESH search terms according toPICO criteria.P(patient) ischildren with ongoing chemotherapy, I(inter- vention) isoral ginger supplementation and standard antiemetic, C (comparison) isstandard antiemetic, and O(outcome) isCINV inci- dence.Inaddition, wealso used hand searching based onselected journal references.Grey literature was also searched using Google Scholar andOpenGrey.Thecomprehensive search strategy isoutlined in Table 1.Norestrictions were made based onthestudy publication date orlanguage.The inclusion criteria required aclinical trial tobeconducted in children aged 0–21.Studies involving participants over theageof21 were included ifthey include subgroup analysis forparticipants aged 0–21.Allchemotherapy procedures were included.
The article was excluded ifitinvolved additional comorbidities leading tonausea and vomiting orifitwascombined with another experimental intervention. Allarticle selections adhered tothePRISMA guidelines [26].2.3.Dataextraction andanalysis Thedata were collected based onselected articles: publication year, place ofstudy, number ofsubjects, study design, patient characteristics, ginger dose andtype, treatment duration, andoutcomes.Relative risk andNNT (number needed totreat) were calculated based ontheout- comes, where possible.Thesummary ofextracted data andanalysis is provided inTable 2.2.4.Riskofbias(RoB)assessment Selected papers ’riskofbiaswasassessed with Cochrane RoBtoolfor randomized trials [27].Results from each domain arecategorized into low, high, orunclear risk.Two authors (H.H.andG.K.E) independently performed article selection, data extraction, data analysis, andriskof bias assessment.Any possible variations were discussed with thethird author (M.L).
3.Results Based onPRISMA strategy, twostudies were found from four data- bases [28,29].Additional searching from citation searching, google scholar, andOpenGrey resulted inidentification oftwofurther studies [30,31].Four studies were thus incorporated intothissystematic review outofatotal of116studies identified through theselection criteria. Complete PRISMA flow chart aredetailed inFig.1.TheCochrane RoB toolforselected studies shows thattwoarereliable [28,30],whereas the other twohave high biaschances [29,31].Thesummary ofthisfinding is shown inFig.2.This systematic review analyzed 189patients who underwent 216 cycles across four studies.Asubject may participate inmultiple in- terventions inastudy duetoundergoing multiple chemotherapy cycles [28].Outof216cycles, 114(52.7%) were acute lymphoblastic leukemiaTable1 Search strategy (performed onJune 30,2023).

Theother twostudies divided ginger supplementation into two andfour doses with 960and1000 mgdaily.Complete ginger supple- mentation doses areexplained inTable 2.Allstudies showed statistical significance.Three studies utilize cat- egorical parameters todetermine theNNT.TheNNTs range from twoto four, asoutlined inTable 2[28,29,31].Astudy utilized ESAS (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System) tomeasure nausea outcomes.Theinter- vention group showed asignificant decrease innausea symptoms and vomiting frequency [30].Two studies didnotreport anyadverse effects [28,30],while the remaining studies didnotprovide ananalysis ofadverse effects.The absence ofanydropouts intheother twostudies suggests thatginger is well accepted bychildren with CINV.
The systematic review does notqualify formeta-analysis due to numerous variations inPICO elements, including ginger dosage and preparation, outcome measurement methods, andstandard antiemetic treatments. Wealso explored proper methodologies forconducting clinical trials ontheuseofginger inchildren, based onprevious clinical trials inchildren andadults, assummarized inTable 3.4.Discussion Ofthefour studies that wefound, inthetwowith high RoB, oralginger supplementation canreduce CINV inchildren.This result aligns with ameta-analysis in2018 showing that ginger supplementation could reduce acute CINV inadults (OR 0.60; 95% CI,0.42 –0.86, P= 0.006, I2=58.45%), with nosignificant effect indelayed CINV [25].Thiscontrasted with a2013 meta-analysis which failed tofindstatistical significance inacute nausea (p=0.67) andacute vomiting (p=0.37) [32].Notably, thatmeta-analysis in2013 included fewer databases and studies, making itlesspowerful.
Other systematic reviews have also obtained conflicting results; allstate thatfurther, higher quality studies areneeded [23,24,33,34]. Cancer type andchemotherapy regimens seem toinfluence ginger ’s success intreating CINV.Despite ameta-analysis in2018 finding ginger only effective inacute CINV, even then showing high heterogeneity (I2 =58%) [25],another meta-analysis in2022 showed that ginger is effective inacute anddelayed CINV with lowheterogeneity (I2=0%)in breast cancer patients with anthracycline and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy [35].Ourstudies inthissystematic review aremainly ALLandosteosarcoma with methotrexate andacombination ofcisplatin anddoxorubicin asachemotherapy regimen.These differences may affect theresult.Differences inginger dose cancause these conflicting results.
Four studies inthissystematic review used 960–2000 mgdaily, whereas other studies inadult systematic review used 100–4000 mgperday[23].In purely chemical modelling, aninadequate dose means thattheinvesti- gated substance cannot sufficientlu influence thetarget receptor. How- ever, astudy showed thatlower doses ofginger (500 and1000 mg)were more effective than higher doses (1500 mg) inreducing CINV [36].Hypothetically, thiscanbecaused bysaturation ofreceptors atcertain doses, soincreasing thedose cannotincrease thepharmacological ef- fect.Further research using lower ginger doses inchildren would be appropriate, given that theexisting studies have used larger doses (960 –2000 mg).However, increasing theginger dose cancause increased sideeffects inthegastrointestinal tract, asdescribed later inthetext.Until now, there hasbeen noconsensus onginger doses forCINV indication.High- quality clinical trials toassess appropriate ginger doses must bedone to determine theoptimal ginger dose.
Ginger supplementation wasgiven forthree days inthree outoffour studies [28,29,31].Another study stated ginger isadministered ifthe patient suffers from CINV [30].Based onitsmechanism, ginger canbe considered tobegiven forlonger than three days toreduce thedelayed CINV symptoms, although further studies arerequired. None ofthestudies state when tostart theCINV, whether before or after chemotherapy, most likely concurrent with chemotherapy.Inother studies, adults were given ginger supplementation three days before chemotherapy started [36–38].One study stated that starting ginger three days before chemotherapy may have primed thegutforan anti-nausea response through 5-HT3 receptor binding andinduction of detoxification enzymes [36].Nevertheless, this statement should be properly established through further clinical trials.Considering that ginger metabolite peak concentration is60min[39,40]andmaximal Fig.2.Risk ofbias based onCochrane risk-of-bias toolforrandomized trials.
Table3 Proposed further clinical trial methodologies forevaluating ginger potential inreducing chemotherapy-induced nausea andvomiting inpediatric patients. Core issue Recommendation Reason References Other CINV treatment Utilize subgroup analysis ifanNK-1 antagonist antiemetic isused inthetreatmentAdministering ginger supplementation orally may inhibit NK-1 antagonist absorption.[49,50,53] Ginger dosage 1000 mgperday Adaily dosage of1000 mgproduced significant results inallfour studies.Increased dosages may result inadverse gastrointestinal effects thatmay worsen CINV.[23, 28–31] Encapsulation Double encapsulation andnitrogen capshould be utilized.Ginger hasapungent odor.
Therefore, blinding without proper encapsulation isdifficult toachieve.[36] Ginger administration intervalDivided into3–4dosage Duetotheapproximately 60–180minelimination half-life, divided doses were recommended.[40] Start ofginger treatmentGinger canbeadministered immediately following chemotherapy.Thepeak concentration ofginger metabolites occurs 60minafter chemotherapy, and themaximum intensity ofCINV occurs 5–6hlater.[39–41] Ginger preparation Useginger powder orginger capsules Arecommendation atthistime isnotpossible duetoinsufficient evidence. Ginger powder contains 41–42% more shogaol andgingerol than ginger capsules.[46]H.Hardietal.Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 15 (2024) 100957 5intensity ofCINV occurs in5–6hafter chemotherapy [41],giving ginger immediately after performing chemotherapy isreasonably acceptable.Ourstudies used ginger supplementation twotofourtimes daily.
Giving ginger supplementation daily 3–4times isreasonable because ginger metabolite elimination half-life isaround 60–180min[40]. Besides thedoses, ginger processing canalsomake thecomposition different.Theheating process indried ginger root converts most gin- gerol intoshogaol [42].Both gingerol andshogaol have antiemetic ef- fects byinterfering with neurotransmitter regulation, improving gastrointestinal function, andacting asantioxidants [43,44].However, westilldon’tknow which compound hasbetter antiemetic properties.Moreover, fourdrying processes caninfluence thecomposition ofginger [45].Inthis systematic review, two studies usecommercial ginger capsules [30,31],whereas theother twousecommercial ginger powder [28,29].Commercial ginger powder has41–42% higher gingerol and shogaol than commercial ginger capsules [46].Blinding wasdone inthree outofthefour studies.
Onestudy stated thatdespite blinding, participants seemed toknow ifthey gotginger ora placebo because they could smell theginger [28].Forfurther studies, blinding canbeperformed bymaking acapsule with double encapsu- lation andnitrogen cap,which hasshown anexcellent masking effect for participants inanother adult study [36]. Noadverse effects were found inthissystematic review.This result concurs with another randomized controlled trial(RCT) thatused ginger foracute gastroenteritis inchildren, finding noadverse effects [47].However, inasystematic review of17RCTs assessing thesideeffects of oral ginger supplementation inadults, 15showed heartburn asaside effect, with varied incidence from 2to37% [23].This side effect can make CINV worse ifithappens.Therefore, theright dose must begiven tomaximize thetherapeutic effect andprevent sideeffects.
Although docking studies stated that12main active ginger compo- nents might exhibit ahigh riskofdrug interaction viainhibition of CYP2C9 and3A4, ginger components seem tohave afavorable phar- macokinetic andtoxicology profile inhuman clinical trials [48].How- ever, onephase IIclinical trialshowed thatdelayed nausea severity was increased when 2.0-g ginger wastaken with aprepitant, anNK1 antag- onist antiemetic [49].One possible explanation isthat ginger could accelerate gastric emptying time andshorten food transit time [50]. Thus itwillinterfere with aprepitant absorption anddecrease aprepi- tant’santi-nausea effects.Itshould beconsidered andassessed infurther clinical trials.Allthestudies thatwefound were intheMENA (Middle East North Africa) region and India.
Tobeapplied globally, further research is needed inother countries duetovariations inantiemetics pharmaco- genetics thatcanaffect CINV treatment success [51].Furthermore, the incidence ofCINV isalsoinfluenced byaperson ’spharmacogenetics of chemotherapeutic agents andopioid analgesics [52]. 5.Conclusion Ginger useasaCINV add-on treatment inchildren hasbeen effective with thefour studies containing good numbers needed totreat.Side effects were notfound inthestudies reviewed.Inspite ofthis, theriskof biasandheterogeneity associated with cancer treatment, chemotherapy regimen, ginger dosage, andginger processing remain substantial in these studies.Consequently, more standardized and high-quality research methods involving children arerequired.This systematic re- view canbeused asafoundation foradditional studies employing standardized methods.
