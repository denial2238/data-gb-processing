In the CG, this neoformation was restrictedto the edges with the deposition of loose co nnective tissue with reduced thickness.
At 45 days, new bone formation ﬁlled almost the entire extension of the bone defect in the 3 groups, with statistically signi ﬁcant osteoid deposition in the CG despite the reduced thickness compared with the HAG and HAMgG. The groups with biomaterial implanta- tion displayed a more abundant osteoid matrix than at 15 days.Work carried out at the Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia (UFRB), Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), and Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saúde Pública (EBMSP), BA, Brazil.received October 4, 2023 acceptedApril 5, 2024DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0044-1787768.ISSN 0102-3616.© 2024.The Author(s).This is an open access article published by Thieme under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, permitting copyingand reproduction so long as the original work is given appropriate credit (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Thieme Revinter Publicações Ltda., Rua do Matoso 170, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, CEP 20270-135, BrazilTHIEME Original Article 519 Article published online: 2024-09-04 Introduction Bone tissue bioengineering, an emerging, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary area, has gained prominence in recent years due to the technical-scienti ﬁc advances achieved and the increasingly growing biomedical and socioeconomic demands in today ’s society. Researchers in this area have applied the principles of biological and health sciences,chemistry, physics, and engineering to developing and im- proving regenerative techniques and biomaterials capable of restoring or improving the function and aesthetics of com-promised tissues and organs.
1–4 To de ﬁne the applicability of these biomaterials, they shall present physical-chemical, biological, and morphological prop-erties similar and compatible with living tissues to act as three- dimensional (3D) scaffolds assisting tissue regeneration or working as suitable replacements for damaged or lost tissuesand organs. Among the various biomaterials currently available, calcium phosphate bioceramics (CaP) represent a widely researched and used class in bone regenerative techniques.1 Among these materials, synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) has stood out in recent decades due to its biocompatibility, similar- ity with biological apatite, bioactivity, osteoconductivity, non-immunogenicity, and enabling cellular events observed during tissue regeneration, such as angiogenesis and osteogenesis.
1–4 However, this ceramic presents slow biodegradation and bio- resorption rates after in vivo implantation, asynchronous to the bone regeneration mechanism.1–4Furthermore, it is a rigid and brittle material, which can remain in the implantation site formonths and even years, depending on the synthesis and processing method.4,5 Given this, one of the main objectives of researchers in this area has been to improve the properties of synthetic HA and modify the characteristics of this material to enhance the tissue response after in vivo implantation. Among the different methods available to carry out these modi ﬁcations, HA-hex- agonal-structure isomorphic substitutions have shown satis-factory results 3,6due to the effects on the physical properties of the material, observed by changes in network parameters, crystalline structure, morphology, solubility, and thermalstability compared to unsubstituted HA.
7 In these cases, other metals, such as zinc (Zn), strontium (Sr),ﬂuorine (F), manganese (Mn), and magnesium (Mg), can replace calcium (Ca).3,4,6Magnesium has attracted great scienti ﬁc interest, considering that, among other properties, it participates in the homeostasis of bone tissue and, togetherwith other minerals, is fundamental to the mechanism of bone regeneration, stimulating bone formation, through the activation of osteoblasts and inhibiting resorption, throughaction on osteoclasts. 8–11 Despite these possibilities, the physicochemical proper- ties, biological behavior, and regenerative capacity of CaPsubstituted with Mg still require further studies to ensure the effectiveness of the techniques used during the synthesis and processing of these biomaterials.
Therefore, this studyevaluated the repair of non-critical bone defects after implantation of Mg-substituted HA microspheres in the rats ’calvaria.Conclusion The biomaterials studied showed biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and bioactivity. The Mg concentration in the substituted HA did not stimulate moresigni ﬁcant bone formation than HA without this ion.

The Author(s).520 Materials and Methods Biomaterials The biomaterials evaluated in this study have been synthe- sized, processed, and sterilized in the Biomaterials Labora-tory (LABIOMAT, in the Portuguese acronym) of the Brazilian Center for Physical Research (Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas, CBPF). The synthesis, processing, and characteriza-tion are described in Santos et al.4 Surgical Procedures This study was performed in the bioterium of Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana (UEFS) after approval by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA, in the Portuguese acronym)of Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saúde Pública, protocol 02/2013.Thirty adults male Wistar rats, with body weight between 350 and 400g, were randomly distributed to form 3experimental groups, with 5 animals each: HAG (defect ﬁlled with HA microspheres group); HAMgG (bone defect ﬁlled with MgHA microspheres group), CG –control group (bone defect without biomaterial), evaluated 15 and 45 days after surgery.
The surgical technique used was the same as described by Miguel et al. 12and illustrated by Santos et al.2However, it is worth highlighting that in these studies, the bone defect was approximately 8.0 mm in diameter, while in this study, it was about 5.0 mm13(►Fig.1 ).Histological Processing and Histomorphological Analysis At the biological points of 15 and 45 days, the animals have been euthanized with a lethal ketamine and xylazine dose.Then, the upper portion of the calvaria was removed, the softtissues were discarded, and the specimens were ﬁxed in 4% buffered formaldehyde for 7 days.After this step, they were decalci ﬁed in 5% nitric acid for 2 hours, embedded in paraf- ﬁn, and cut into 5.0-µm thick slices.The histological sectionsobtained were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and subsequently examined by standard light microscopy(DM1000 –Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for histo- morphological and morphometric analysis.
A digital camera (DFC 310 FX –Leica Camera AG, Wetzlar, Germany) coupled to a standard light microscope (DM1000 –Leica) and the software QWin 3.1 (Leica) measured the area of the newly formed mineralized matrix in the 3 experimental groups.Subsequently, statistical analysis was carried out based on the mean and standard deviation to obtain the p-value, with a signi ﬁcance level of 5% ( p<0.05), using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results Histomorphological Analysis At 15 days, in the HAG, neoformation of an osteoid matrixwas observed associated with the bone edges and surround- ing some microspheres, which were predominantly orga- nized in a monolayer and occupied the entire extension ofthe bone defect, maintaining the thickness proportional to the edges ( ►Fig.2A ).Active osteocytes and osteoblasts were observed associated with this matrix.
The formation ofconnective tissue and mild chronic in ﬂammation with mononuclear in ﬂammatory in ﬁltrate and multinucleated giant cells, mainly around the microspheres, was notedbetween the mineralized areas and the microspheres ( ►Fig. 2B ).At the biological point of 45 days, the microspheres in the HAG were mainly distributed in multilayers.The newly formed osteoid matrix was more evident than at 15 days andﬁlled, on average, 4/5 of the bone defect in a centripetal direction, surrounded by the biomaterial ( ►Fig.2C ).The microspheres near the edges were surrounded by the newly Fig.1 Surgical steps for creating a non-critical bone defect.( A) Calvarial region after trichotomy and antisepsis; ( B)ﬂap re ﬂected after a semilunar bi-coronal skin incision to expose the bone tissue; (C) demarcation of the bone defect in the median portion of the calvaria; and ( D) non-critical bone defect created.Fig.2 Photomicrograph of HAG –15 and 45 days.

In the HAMgG, at 15 days, with the biomaterials, neo- formation of the osteoid matrix was noted in a centripetal direction, more evident in the peripheral region of the defect ( ►Fig. 3A ).Like HA, the biomaterials ﬁlled the entire bone defect, with a thickness proportional to the edges, and arranged in a monolayer.Active osteoblasts and numerous osteocytes were observed in association with the osteoid matrix.The remaining areas were ﬁlled with loose connec- tive tissue full of blood vessels ( ►Fig.3B ) and chronic granulomatous in ﬂammatory in ﬁltrate of moderate appear- ance, mainly surrounding the microspheres.At the biological point of 45 days, in the HAMgG, the new bone formation permeated by the microspheres extendedcentripetally and con ﬂuently, ﬁlling approximately 2/3 of the linear extension of the defect ( ►Fig.3C ).Furthermore, it was noted that the microspheres located close to the edges weresurrounded by osteoid neoformation rich in osteocytes.
In the residual area, there was a new formation of connective tissue, more organized than at 15 days, and a large number ofblood capillaries ( ►Fig. 3D ).The CG, at 15 days, displayed bone neoformation with a reactional appearance associated with the edges, presentingactive osteoblasts and osteocytes.The remaining area showed deposition of loose connective tissue, with reduced thickness, abundant in spindle cells and blood vessels( ►Fig.4A ).At 45 days, new bone formation extended beyond the edge in a centripetal direction, more evidently than at 15 days ( ►Fig.4B ).The chronic in ﬂammation observed was discreet and scarce.Tissue repair was completed with the formation of connective tissue in the region and no mineralization.Histomorphometric Analysis The histomorphometric study displayed no statistically sig-niﬁcant differences among the three groups evaluated at 15 days when analyzing the newly formed osteoid matrix area.
At the biological point of 45 days, statistical signi ﬁcance was noted when comparing the HAMgG and HAG with the CG, with the latter group having a higher average of newly formed osteoid matrix ( ►Table 1 ). Discussion Experimental models in vivo have been referenced for many decades in different types of studies in various knowledge areas.To evaluate biomaterials designed for bone regeneration, these models must present anatomical and physiological char- acteristics that enable an understanding of natural phenomenato determine the osteogenic potential of the materials investi- gated.Thus, among the different possibilities for studies, the Fig.3 Photomicrograph of HAMgG –15 days and 45 days.Micro- spheres (M) are observed distributed in a monolayer, permeatedby a newly formed osteoid matrix ( /C3), in a centripetal direction, and by connective tissue (CT), rich in blood vessels (black arrow).Abbrevia- tions: Be, bone edge; V, central vein; HE, hematoxylin and eosin.15 days ( A,B).

This in- ﬂammation, chronic granulomatous, discrete, and regressive throughout the study, agreed with what occurs when abiomaterial is implanted in vivo . 15,16These ﬁndings are in line with what was observed by Santos et al .,2Santos et al.,4 Miguel et al .,12Daltro et al.,13Almeida et al.17and Ribeiro et al.18These authors evaluated different types of biomaterials for bone regeneration, in rat calvaria, and described the same tissue response.During the physiological events that occur in bone regen- eration, besides the release of cytokines and chemical medi- ators, there is the secretion of growth, cellular differentiation,and angiogenic factors, which stimulate the formation of connective tissue rich in new blood vessels, with consequent development of granulation tissue, as well as deposition of the osteoid matrix, which subsequently becomes mineralized.At all biological points, such histomorphological characteristicswere observed in the three groups evaluated in our study.
At 45 days, in the CG, the neoformation of mineralized tissue was approximately 60%. However, in HAG and HAMgG this per-centage was 25 and 20%, respectively.This difference in bone neoformation in the two groups with biomaterial implanta- tion, as compared to the CG, derives from the presence ofmicrospheres in the bone defect since these were sintered and, consequently, not reabsorbed due to the sintering of the material –a procedure that promotes changes in the HA crystal lattice with crystal fusion.19Thus, in HAG and HAMgG, the microspheres occupied a large part of the sectional area of the defect and, thus, formed a three-dimensional frameworkthroughout the linear extension and height of the bone defect.It is worth highlighting that although some authors suggest and defend some methodologies as standard, thereis still no consensus in the literature on which bone defect exact diameter shall be considered non-critical or critical.
A “critical ”bone defect has been de ﬁned as a bone defect that does not regenerate throughout the life of the animal 20or of the study.21In these cases, the repair is completed by ﬁbrosis, and new bone formation is restricted to theedges.4,12,17,18This situation was not observed in the present study, in which new mineralized tissue formed centripetallyalong the biological points, with regeneration of almost the entire defect area in the CG at 45 days. These ﬁndings contrast with the results obtained by authors who classifythis 5.0-mm bone defect as critical.22–24 Concerning bone regeneration, a 3D scaffold is essential for the cellular and vascular events observed during this mecha-nism.Therefore, ceramic biomaterials have been widely stud- ied for this purpose in different forms of presentation and composition.
Scienti ﬁc and technological advances experi- enced in recent decades have increasingly enabled the devel- opment of materials with biomimetic physicochemical characteristics to stimulate new bone formation. Among thesematerials, HA has been extensively researched due to its biocompatibility, similarity with natural components of the mineral phase of bone tissue, osteoconductivity, bioactivity, 1,3 and lack of toxicity and immunogenicity.Our study observed such characteristics in the two groups in which biomaterials were implanted, in the three biological points, which allowedthe formation of an osteoid matrix and connective tissue between and surrounding the microspheres.
The HA hexagonal structure performs ionic exchanges at the Ca 2þand HPO 43/C0sites with elements or functional groups that are naturally part of the bone composition topromote changes in crystallinity, solubility, biodegradation, and, consequently, in biological properties of the biomaterial after in vivo implantation. 4,25,26Mg stands out, playing a critical role in bone metabolism and growth: the de ﬁciency of this element inhibits the osteoblasts ’activity, favoring the osteoclasts ’survival and performance.27,28Furthermore, the presence of Mg contributes to biomineralization, mainly in the initial phase of osteogenesis: it increases the kinetics of HA nucleation, delays its crystallization, and can interferewith qualitative changes in the bone matrix.29This is proba- bly why the average bone formation at 15 days was higher in HAMgG compared to HAG, however, without statisticallysigniﬁcant differences.
Despite this, this pattern did not repeat after 45 days, and the average osteoid matrix forma- tion was similar between these groups. Mg also has an essential effect on promoting angiogenesis, stimulating endothelial cells, and the production of vascular growth factors, 30which may justify the presence of more evident blood vessels in HAMgG than in the other groups throughout the study.
Furthermore, incorporating this metal into the HA structure promoted a slight decrease in theTable 1 Percentage of the newly formed mineralized area in relation to the total area of the defect at the 15- and 45-days biological points, in the 3 experimental groups Group PeriodHAMgG HAG CG P-value (between-group)Comparison HAMgG x HAGComparison of CG with HAMgG and HAG 15 days 25% (/C629) 12% ( /C67) 20% ( /C638) p¼0.58 NS p¼0.55 NS HAMgG: p¼0.89 NS HAG: p¼0.82 NS 45 days 20% (/C613) 25% ( /C611) 61% ( /C621) p¼0.01 S p¼0.92 NS HAMgG: p¼0.01 S HAG: p¼0.02 S Abbreviations: CG, control group; HAG, group with defect ﬁlled with hydroxyapatite microspheres; HAMgG, group with bone defect ﬁlled with magnesium-substituted hydroxyapatite micro spheres group; NS, not statistically signi ﬁc a n t ;S ,s t a t i s t i c a l l ys i g n i ﬁcant.

The biocompatibility and bioactivity of the biomaterials studied here demonstrate that these materials have future clinical applications, especially as ﬁller biomaterials. Given the results obtained in this work, new studies shall analyze these biomaterials without heat treatment (sintering) and with other variations in Mg concentration in critical(8.0 mm) and non-critical defects (5.0 mm) to better charac- terize the osteogenic potential of these ceramics replaced with this metal.Conclusions The biomaterials evaluated in this study are biocompatible, osteoconductive, and bioactive.The Mg substituted in HA stimulated a higher bone formation only in the initial phaseof bone repair (15 days), forming the osteoid matrix similarly between ceramics in the ﬁnal stage of the study.Authors ’Contributions The authors contributed individually and signi ﬁcantly to the development of this article: JAS: Study conception anddesign; manuscript preparation; and surgical procedures.
