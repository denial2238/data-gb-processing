Editorial Dietary Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Amelioration of CKD: Possible Cellular Mechanisms Takeshi Yamamoto and Yoshitaka Isaka KIDNEY360 4: 1661 –1662, 2023.doi: https://doi.org/10.34067/KID.0000000000000252 To preserve kidney function for adults with CKD or increased CKD risk, dietary modi ﬁcations are rec- ommended.Namely, dietary intake of nonsaturated fats, primarily monounsaturated and polyunsatu- rated lipids, including omega-3 fatty acids, has beenrecommended in addition to sodium and protein restriction.1Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are referred to as essential fattyacids because they are not intrinsically synthesized.Accumulating evidence suggests that omega-3 PUFAs have potential bene ﬁts in preserving kidney function in patients with different types of CKD.
2Further- more, omega-3 PUFAs exert pleiotropic biological actions, including lipid-modulating, antihyperten- sive, antithrombotic, and anti-in ﬂammatory effects, as well as cardiovascular protection.2In addition, a recent pooled analysis of 19 cohorts demonstrated that high levels of seafood-derived omega-3 PUFAsare associated with a reduced CKD risk and a slower decline in kidney function. 3 Theﬁnal common pathway of kidney damage often involves in ﬂammation and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis.Consequently, therapies that in ﬂuence in ﬂammation, such as omega-3 PUFAs, have been assessed.Exper- imental studies using various models have shown thebeneﬁcial effects of omega-3 PUFAs.4–6Inﬂammation involves two processes, initiation and resolution, both of which are active reactions.
Omega-6 and omega-3PUFA-derived metabolites are crucially involved in both processes, and an imbalance in these metabolites leads to the ampli ﬁcation and long-term continuation of inﬂammation, resulting in tissue damage. Accelera- ted resolution of in ﬂammation contributes to the main- tenance of organ homeostasis.Omega-3 PUFA metab-olites promote resolution and protect the kidney fromischemia-reperfusion injury.2Thus, a balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 has been suggested to have beneﬁcial implications for kidney health.However, it remains unclear how and to what extent their dietary intake would bene ﬁt CKD.In this issue of Kindey360, Muramatsu et al.7exam- ined whether a diet rich in omega-6 arachidonic acid (ARA) and/or omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)mitigated the increase in urinary albumin excretion and renal dysfunction in rats subjected to 5/6 nephrec-tomy.The rats underwent 5/6 kidney removal and were consistently fed diets containing ARA and/or DHA for 4 weeks.
Nephrectomy led to increased levelsof urinary albumin excretion, reactive oxygen species, inﬂammation, and tubule-interstitial ﬁbrosis, all of which were attenuated in rats fed a DHA-containingdiet, whereas no such improvement was observed in rats fed ARA 2or ARA 1DHA-containing diets. In addition to con ﬁrming the suppressive effects of DHA on nephrectomy-induced in ﬂammation and ﬁbrosis, 4,5this study explored the possible mecha- nisms by which DHA protects against kidney ﬁbrosis.This study involved the analysis of fatty acid compo-sition and their metabolites in the kidney using gas chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Nephrectomy signi ﬁcantly in- creases ARA and its metabolites, such as thromboxane B2, which acts as a precursor of proin ﬂammatory mediators in the kidney.
By contrast, DHA supple-mentation not only increased the levels of DHA andeicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), along with their metab- olites, including 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid, 20-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid, and 18-hydroxyei-cosapentaenoic acid, which serve as precursors of proresolution mediators, but also reduced the ARA levels in the kidney. Furthermore, DHA downregu-lates the expression of proin ﬂammatory cytokines and the in ﬁltration of in ﬂammatory cells into the kidney, leading to the amelioration of renal dysfunc-tion and ﬁbrosis.These results suggest that the alter- ations induced by DHA in the composition of FAs, particularly the signi ﬁcant reduction in ARA metab- olites and increase in DHA and EPA metabolites, mayconfer bene ﬁcial effects on renal function by regulat- ing in ﬂammation.As an additional cellular mechanism by which DHA impedes CKD progression, this study explored the potential involvement of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) in the kidney.
The study observed a note-worthy decrease in IS levels in the kidneys of rats fed the DHA-containing diet.

Given that IS directly accelerates cellular senescencein PTECs, 8which is associated with tubulointerstitial injury, IS accumulation in the tubules and higher serum IS levels may contribute to a vicious cycle that leads to CKD pro- gression.Further investigations are required to determinewhether DHA supplementation directly reduces IS accu- mulation and tubulotoxicity in the pathogenesis of CKD.Collectively, the authors concluded that dietary intake ofDHA can suppress CKD progression, although further mechanistic, epidemiological, and clinical studies are war- ranted to elucidate the role of omega-3 PUFAs in the pre-vention and treatment of CKD.
Finally, considering that the macroautophagy/autophagy- lysosomal system plays a primary role in cellular clearance,we would like to introduce the concept of autophagy asanother plausible mechanism for the ameliorative effects of omega-3 PUFAs. Recent studies have suggested that auto- phagy is impaired in various forms of CKD.9,10For instance, overloaded lipids, such as saturated palmitic acid, induce autophagy to maintain the integrity of PTECs by renewing the plasma and organelle membranes.However, the acti-vation of autophagy places a burden on the lysosomal system, leading to autophagy stagnation, which manifests as phospholipid accumulation in enlarged lysosomes.10 Previous ﬁndings have demonstrated that EPA reduces several hallmarks of renal lipotoxicity, including both lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, in ﬂammation, andﬁbrosis.
Notably, the ef ﬁcacy of EPA is not only solely reliant on improvements in metabolic syndrome but also involves various cell-intrinsic and autophagy-dependent mechanisms. EPA ameliorates lysosomal dysfunction andautophagy impairment, reduces the demand for auto- phagy, and facilitates the formation of lipid droplets, as well as the transfer of fatty acids from lipid droplets tomitochondria for beta-oxidation.6Furthermore, autophagy stagnation is also observed in aging kidneys, where the gradual accumulation of waste impedes autophagy en-hancement.9Consequently, omega-3 PUFAs may slow down kidney aging by modulating cellular membranes, thereby improving autophagy.In conclusion, this study demonstrates that omega-3 PUFAs attenuate ﬁbrosis in animals with CKD by mitigat- ing oxidative stress and in ﬂammation.These observations highlight the potential role of omega-3 PUFAs as adjuncts totherapeutic strategies aimed at retarding the progression of CKD.Disclosures Y.
