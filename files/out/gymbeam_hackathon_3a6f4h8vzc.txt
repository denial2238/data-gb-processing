Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of genetic disorders that aﬀect hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body, leading to a range of clinical manifestations and decreased life expectancy. Worldwide, an estimated 312,000 children are born each year with sickle cell anemia, the most common and severe form of SCD (Piel 2013).While the majority of aﬀected individuals originate from sub-Saharan Africa (Modell 2008), SCD also aﬀects people of Mediterranean, Caribbean, Middle-Eastern, and Asian origin.In the USA, life expectancy for people with SCD is 54 years for males and 55 years for females (Lubeck 2019).The clinical manifestations associated with SCD are the result of chronic anemia and the blockage of small blood vessels (Belcher 2014; Kuypers 1998).The rigid sickled cells adhere to the lining of blood vessels.
The resultant vaso-occlusion blocks oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, leading to inflammation (De Franceschi 2011; Vinchi 2013). Over time, repetitive vaso-occlusion damages blood vessels, leading to vasculopathy (Kato 2006; Pegelow 1997).The resulting pathophysiology is the basis for clinical manifestations including, but not limited to, vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE), acute chest syndrome, acute splenic sequestration, and stroke (Kato 2007).The vasculopathy of SCD is further associated with organ damage, including early loss of splenic function, resulting in an increased risk of infection (Ramakrishnan 2010).Additionally, the dense, dehydrated red blood cells are easily destroyed, leading to hemolytic anemia.This chronic anemia results in increased fatigue, pulmonary hypertension, and leg ulcerations (Higgs 1982; Nolan 2005).There are multiple therapies, used alone or in combination, to manage and treat SCD and its comorbidities.
Prophylactic measures to prevent pneumococcal infections include daily penicillin and early immunization in children. Blood transfusion therapy is highly eﬀective for many acute, life-threatening complications of SCD, including stroke and acute chest syndrome; however, chronic blood transfusion carries the risk of iron overload, infections, and transfusion reactions (Wood 2004).Hydroxyurea, a chemotherapeutic drug, is the only disease-modifying medication and has been shown to reduce the risk of many common SCD- related complications, including VOEs, acute chest syndrome, and stroke (Wong 2014).However, international availability and accessibility are limited, and the long-term eﬀects are not well known (Meremikwu 2011).Bone marrow transplant is currently the only potential curative therapy for people with SCD (Bolanos- Meade 2012; Hoppe 2001), but the associated significant risks and the low proportion of eligible individuals mean this treatment is rarely used.
For managing sickle cell anemia, daily folic acid supplementation of 1 mg/day is a common treatment due to a presumed folate deficiency in the setting of hemolytic anemia and rapid red blood cell turnover (Falletta 1995). Folate, a water-soluble B vitamin, plays a role in cell division and erythropoiesis.However, there is limited evidence for the eﬀicacy of folate supplementation to reduce anemia, and a recent Cochrane Review concluded that “while it is possible that folic acid supplementation may increase serum folate levels, the eﬀect of supplementation on anemia and any symptoms of anemia remains unclear” (Dixit 2016).Description of the intervention In this review, we will consider the intervention to be supplementation or fortification (or both) with B vitamins from synthetic or food sources in people with SCD.
The B vitamins include eight water-soluble vitamins that play inter-related roles in cellular functioning: thiamine; riboflavin; niacin; pantothenic acid; pyridoxine; biotin; folate; and cobalamin. Thiamine (B 1) is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates and the synthesis of branched-chained amino acids.Food sources of thiamine include meat, fish, and whole grains.However, very little is known about the bioavailability (the proportion of a substance that enters circulation and is available for use) of thiamin (IOM 1998).The USA's recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for thiamine is 1.2 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women.Dietary supplements containing thiamine mononitrate and thiamine hydrochloride (stable and water-soluble forms) typically provide about 1.5 mg of thiamine per dose (IOM 1998).Riboflavin (B 2) plays a major role in energy metabolism.
The dietary intake of riboflavin from food sources, including eggs, green leafy vegetables, and organ meats (kidney, heart, liver) (Murray 2000) is highly bioavailable (Zempleni 1996). In the USA, the RDA for adults is 1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women.Dietary supplements, containing either the free form or riboflavin 5’- phosphate, typically provide 1.7 mg per dose (IOM 1998).Niacin (B3) is involved in carbohydrate metabolism and DNA replication and repair (IOM 1998; Kim 1994; Lautier 1993).Niacin is found in many foods, including meat, fish, poultry, and bread products.Free niacin, e.g.found in beans and liver, is highly bioavailable (IOM 1998), but in cereal grains, niacin is only 30% bioavailable (Carpenter 1985; Carter 1982).The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) developed niacin equivalents (NE) to reflect the fact that niacin requirements are also met by the conversion of tryptophan (1 mg NE = 1 mg niacin = 60 mg of tryptophan).
In the USA, the RDA for niacin in adults is 16 mg/day NEs for men and 14 mg/day NEs for women (IOM 1998). Pantothenic acid (B5) plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism as well as cholesterol and lipid synthesis (IOM 1998; Tahiliani 1991).It is found in all plant and animal foods, and the limited available studies estimated that approximately 50% of food-bound pantothenic acid is bioavailable (Tarr 1981).Recommended intakes of pantothenic acid are based on an adequate intake (AI), which specifies 5 mg/day for adults (IOM 1998).Pyridoxine /uni00A0(B6) contributes to the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, one-carbon units, and carbohydrates.Liver, whole grain cereals, and soy-based products are rich sources of B6.Dephosphorylated forms of B6 are absorbed by passive diﬀusion in the small intestine (Hamm 1979).In a mixed diet, vitamin B6 is approximately 75% bioavailable (Gregory 1997; Tarr 1981).In the USA, the RDA for adults is 1.3 mg/day (IOM 1998).
Biotin (B7) is involved in glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism (Dakshinamurti 1994 ). It exists as free or protein- bound forms in food.There is very limited information on biotin bioavailability and its content in foods.The AI for biotin, which is 30 /uni03BCg/day for adults in the USA, is based on limited evidence (IOM 1998).Vitamin B supplementation for sickle cell disease (Protocol) Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.2 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Folate (B9) plays a role in the synthesis of nucleic and amino acids (Bailey 2004; Ulrich 2008).Sources of folate include dark green leafy vegetables, meat, and fish.Bioavailability from food folates is approximately 50% (IOM 1998; Pfeiﬀer 1997).In supplements and fortified foods, folate is in the oxidized and stabile form of folic acid.
Without food, approximately 100% supplemented folic acid is bioavailable. When consumed with food, bioavailability decreases to 85% (Carmel 2005; Pfeiﬀer 1997).The FNB developed dietary folate equivalents (DFE) to reflect the fact that the bioavailability of folic acid is higher than folate (1 /uni03BCg DFEs = 1 /uni03BCg food folate = 0.5 /uni03BCg folic acid without food = 0.6 /uni03BCg folic acid with food).In the USA, the RDA for men and women is 400 /uni03BCg/day.Dietary supplements of folic acid typically contain 400 /uni03BCg per dose (IOM 1998).Cobalamin (B12) is required for proper cell division and DNA synthesis.Major food sources of vitamin B12 are of animal origin.Data on the bioavailability of B12 from food are limited; however, studies show that the fractional absorption of B12 decreases as the oral dose increases (Adams 1971; Chanarin 1979 ).From an oral dose of 1 /uni03BCg, only 50% is absorbed ( Adams 1971).
The RDA for B12 takes this assumed absorption into account, and in the USA, the RDA for adults is 2.4 /uni03BCg/day (IOM 1998). While most B vitamin supplements are safe across a broad range of doses that are commercially available, there are possible adverse eﬀects (AEs) associated with very high pharmacological doses of some supplemental forms of vitamins B3, B6, and B9.Pharmacological doses of nicotinic acid, a supplemental form of niacin (vitamin B3), can cause skin flushing and irritation, gastrointestinal distress, and hepatoxicity.While nicotinamide is generally associated with fewer AEs than nicotinic acid, high doses can lead to diarrhea (IOM 1998).Chronic intake of pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) supplements at more than 100-fold the US RDA level caused peripheral neuropathy leading to ataxia in adults (Bendich 1990 ; Gdynia 2008).Gastrointestinal distress and skin irritation have also been associated with excessive vitamin B6 intake (IOM 1998).
Pharmacological doses of folic acid (in excess of 5 mg/day) appeared to worsen neurological outcomes in case reports of individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency from the 1940s and 1950s. It was hypothesized that folic acid 'masked' the megaloblastic anemia of vitamin B12 deficiency while allowing for progression of the neurological symptoms (IOM 1998).However, these adverse reports are of current debate among experts in the field (Berry 2019), and the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for healthy populations is set at 1 mg folic acid per day in an eﬀort to negate this potential risk (IOM 1998).In contrast to supplemental folic acid, there is no UL associated with natural folate from food sources (Field 2018).How the intervention might work In individuals with SCD, the sickled blood cells have a shorter lifespan (10 to 20 days) compared to normal red blood cells (90 to 120 days) (West 1992).
This rapid cell turnover leads to a decrease in the red blood cell count and increased erythropoiesis. The metabolic demands of increased red blood cell formation require a concomitant increase in protein and energy metabolism (Hibbert 2006) as well as provision of nucleotides, which are substrates for DNA synthesis.B vitamins involved in the production of red blood cells include B6, folate, and B12.Vitamin B6 deficiency has been confirmed in two studies of adults with SCD, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency was found in one study of children with SCD (Hyacinth 2010).Vitamin B6 is needed for the synthesis of heme, the iron-containing component of hemoglobin.Small, microcytic red blood cells (due to a decrease in hemoglobin synthesis) are an indicator of vitamin B6 deficiency (IOM 1998).Both folate and vitamin B12 are required for DNA synthesis and cell division, which is vital for proper cell growth and replication.
Low folate and vitamin B12 intake are associated with megaloblastic anemia. Megalobastic anemia is characterized by abnormally large red blood cell precursors, which result from impaired DNA replication, and can be reversed by folate or vitamin B12 supplementation (or both) (IOM 1998; Lindenbaum 1988).Folate or vitamin B12 supplementation (or both) may also prevent hyperhomocysteinemia, which has been associated with thrombotic events.Therefore, it is possible that B vitamin supplementation may help to treat painful occlusive events associated with SCD.In addition, folic acid supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, a common comorbidity of SCD, in hypertensive adults (Huo 2015).Several B vitamins also play a role in energy metabolism.Deficiencies in thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, and biotin are associated with conditions (i.e.
fatigue, muscle wasting) related to impairments in pathways involved in energy production, including carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism (IOM 1998). Based on these data, it has been proposed in the literature that the concentration of B vitamins required to meet the increased metabolic demand of red blood cell formation might impose a higher nutritional requirement for B vitamins in people with SCD compared to the general population (Hyacinth 2010).Since it is not always possible for people to achieve these levels of vitamin B intake from diet alone, food fortification and oral supplementation are commonly-used strategies to improve the intake status of target populations.
Food fortification refers to the process of adding nutrients to foods that are commonly eaten with the goal of meeting a physiological requirement at a population level, whereas oral supplementation refers to the provision of micronutrients in the form of tablets and powders at dosages that exceed the RDA to meet individual-level requirements. Medical foods are foods designed to meet nutritional needs of clinical patients with distinct nutritional requirements that cannot be met by diet alone, delivered at the individual level.It is proposed that food fortification and oral supplementation with B vitamins may improve SCD-related health outcomes.Why it is important to do this review Folate supplementation for SCD is based on the hypothesis that an increased rate of red blood cell degradation leads to a depletion of folate stores in people with hemolytic anemia.
However, a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of folic acid supplementation indicated that it is unclear whether or not folic acid supplementation in SCD reduces the risk of anemia (Dixit 2016). Furthermore, it is important to note that folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 are all required cofactors for the same highly interconnected network of metabolic pathways.Insuﬀicient intake of any one cofactor o/f_ten impairs the function of other related Vitamin B supplementation for sickle cell disease (Protocol) Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.3 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews metabolic pathways; thus, supplementation with one cofactor might not be suﬀicient to reduce the risk for anemia or related clinical outcomes.
Similarly, a study evaluating the optimal dosages of B-vitamins involved in red blood cell production (B6, folate, and B12) in children with SCD found evidence to support required supplementation at doses that are 2.5 to 10 times greater than the RDA in the USA (Van der Dijs 2002). This Cochrane Review is needed because a previous related review focused on folate alone, and given that metabolic pathways supporting red blood cell production require multiple B vitamins, there is a need for a broader review to study all B vitamins.Furthermore, this review will include non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) because current clinical practice guidelines consider folate supplementation as routine and this leads naturally to a lack of RCT-evidence for folate and other B- vitamin supplementation on patient-centered outcomes in SCD.
The consideration of NRSIs in this review will leverage cohort and other study designs to allow a fuller exploration of dose-response and of long-term benefits and risks of the intervention. This review will consider the evidence from RCTs, quasi-RCTs, and NRSIs for supplementation or fortification (or both) with B vitamins to understand the benefits and risks of vitamin B supplementation in SCD.These data are needed to develop guidelines for nutritional adequacy of B vitamins in people with SCD that will contribute to minimizing SCD-associated morbidity.The information from this Cochrane Review may also inform the design of future RCTs.O B J E C T I V E S To assess the eﬀectiveness of vitamin B supplementation in children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), compared to no intervention or an alternative vitamin B supplementation given as part of standard care.
M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies In this review, we plan to assess the eﬀectiveness of B vitamin supplementation in children and adults with SCD, compared to control group participants who receive no intervention, an existing policy, or another type of intervention. We will include both RCTs and NRSIs.The latter designs are being included to supplement or complement (or both) the RCT evidence (Schünemann 2013 ).Nutritional supplementation is complex, particularly in children, especially in community settings or where the study exist as part of a public health program.Additionally, RCTs are generally not the best design to assess contextual issues or adverse events that may occur in the longer term (Schünemann 2013 ).For this reason, we will include the following study designs.RCTs •RCTs •Quasi-RCTs - participants allocated to treatment arms in a way that is not truly random, e.g.
by date of birth •Cluster-RCTs (cRCTs) with baseline data and at least two clusters per armNRSIs •Follow-up studies (e.g. cohort studies) •Controlled before-and-a/f_ter studies with a contemporaneous control group (e.g.interrupted time series (ITS)) Types of participants We will include individuals with SCD of all ages, sexes and SCD genotypes.Genetic variants will include sickle cell anemia (HbSS), hemoglobin SCD (HbSC), Sβ-thalassemia (HbSB+, HbSBº), and other rare genetic variants.Types of interventions Inclusion criteria We will include studies where the intervention is oral supplementation with one or more B vitamins, either singly or in combination with other micronutrients, at any dose and for any duration.Duration of the intervention will vary with type of supplementation, whether combined with other micronutrients or B vitamins alone; therefore, we will consider potential diﬀerences in eﬀicacy by duration, dose and type of intervention in subgroup analyses.
For the purpose of this review, oral supplementation refers to the delivery of B vitamins alone or with other micronutrients either as a tablet, capsule, liquid or powder. We will also include studies of food fortification with B vitamins.We plan to make the following comparisons: 1.supplementation with B vitamins versus placebo (where placebo refers to diet without specially fortified foods, as defined by the study authors); 2.fortification of diet with B vitamins versus placebo; 3.supplementation with B vitamins versus diet fortification with B vitamins; 4.supplementation with B vitamins and diet fortification versus diet fortification only.We will include studies with a co-intervention as long as it is the same for the intervention and comparison groups.Exclusion criteria We will exclude studies as below.1.Studies assessing the intervention of vitamin B12 by intramuscular or subcutaneous injections.
People with a severe vitamin B12 deficiency are most likely to receive this intervention, which normally needs to be administered by a healthcare professional (Lane 2002). 2.Studies which primarily study individuals who have received a blood transfusion within three months before the start of the study.The lifespan of a red blood cell is typically 60 to 90 days; therefore, excluding based on this criterion will prevent confounding of hematological biomarker measurements and red blood cell folate measurements (Franco 2009; McDonald 1978).Types of outcome measures We plan to assess the following outcome measures.Vitamin B supplementation for sickle cell disease (Protocol) Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.4 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.

Electronic searches The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Information Specialist will conduct a search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register for relevant trials.The Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane Library) and weekly searches of MEDLINE.
Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of five major conferences: the European Haematology Association conference; the American Society of Hematology conference; the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting; the Caribbean Public Health Agency Annual Scientific Meeting (formerly the Caribbean Health Research Council Meeting); and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program Annual Meeting. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant section of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's website.Using tailored search strategies (Appendix 1), we will also search the following databases and trials registries for relevant trials and NRSIs: •PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed); 1946 onwards); •Embase Ovid (1974 onwards);•CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1982 onwards); •CAB Abstracts via Web of Science (1910 onwards).
•US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register Clinicaltrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); •World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (trialsearch.who.int/); •ISRCTN Registry (www.isrctn.com). Searching other resources We will search the reference lists of included articles and reviews for additional relevant studies.We will also contact authors of included studies as well as known researchers and nutritional SCD experts in the field to identify additional studies, including unpublished and ongoing studies.We will provide a contact list of experts contacted in the final review.Data collection and analysis Selection of studies The review authors (EBA and RD) will independently assess the titles and abstracts of all articles found in the literature searches to identify eligible reports in accordance with the specified inclusion criteria.
If we cannot determine eligibility for inclusion from the titles or abstracts, we will retrieve and review the full-text articles. Two review authors (EBA and RD) will retrieve full-text reports of trials that are eligible, and these two authors will independently examine them for compliance with the eligibility criteria.We will not be blinded to information about articles such as the journal of publication, author names, institution, or the study results.If necessary, review authors will correspond with investigators to obtain further information to determine study eligibility.Where there are disagreements about the inclusion of a study, review authors will involve a third review author (PAC) to discuss and reach a consensus.We will present the excluded studies with reasons for exclusion in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table in the full review.
Data extraction and management Two review authors (MSF and CDK) will independently extract the data for primary and secondary outcomes in a customized, piloted data collection form developed for RCTs and NRSI using the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group’s data extraction template. Two authors (MSF, EBA) will enter relevant data into the Review Manager 5 so/f_tware (Review Manager 2020), and two authors will check for errors (EBA and RD).The review authors will resolve any issues and concerns in data extraction by discussion and if necessary, review with a third review author (PAC).Review authors will extract data from both full-text versions and abstracts.Where there is more than one report linked to a single trial, we will use one data extraction form per trial.If the information in the published article is not clear, we will contact the trial authors for further details.We will extract the following information.

Time points For included studies, we will extract primary and secondary outcome data based on prespecified categories of: short term (three to six months) medium term (over six months and less than 12 months) and long term (one year or greater).Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two authors (MSF and EBA) will independently assess the risk of bias of included studies.RCTs For RCTs and trials with a separate control group, we will assess seven domains for each trial as described below.In each domain, we will assign a judgment of 'low', 'high', or 'unclear' risk of bias according to criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2017a ).
1.Random sequence generation: low risk of bias (if the investigators included random component in sequence generation process such as using random number table, computer-generated random number, coin tossing, shuﬀling cards or envelops, etc.); high risk of bias (if the investigators included a non-random component in sequence generation process such as the use of date of birth, date of admission, hospital or clinic record number, etc.); or unclear risk of bias (If there is no suﬀicient information about sequence generation process to judge whether there is a high or low risk).
2.Allocation concealment: low risk of bias (if the investigators used methods such as central allocation, sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance, sequentially numbered opaque or sealed envelopes so that participants andinvestigator enrolling could not foresee the assignment); high risk of bias (if the investigators used an open random allocation schedule, non-opaque envelopes and any other quasi-randomization methods such as alternation or rotation, case record number, etc. so that participants and the enrolling investigator could potentially foresee the assignment); or unclear risk of bias (if method of concealment is not described or there is insuﬀicient information to judge whether there is a high or low risk).
3.Blinding of participants and personnel: low risk of bias (if participants or personnel were blinded to treatment and the method of blinding is described); high risk of bias (if participants and personnel were not blinded or only partially blinded); or unclear risk of bias (if there is insuﬀicient information to judge whether there is a high or low risk). 4.Blinding of outcome assessment: low risk of bias (outcome assessors were blinded and the method of blinding was described); high risk of bias (outcome assessors were not blinded or if any blinding was likely broken); or unclear risk of bias (if there is insuﬀicient information to judge whether there is a high or low risk).
5.Incomplete outcome data: low risk of bias (no attrition, the number of dropouts or withdrawals was balanced across intervention groups with similar reasons); high risk of bias (imbalance of dropouts or withdrawals in intervention groups, the number and reasons of dropouts or withdrawals was not described); or unclear risk of bias (if there is insuﬀicient information to judge whether there is a high or low risk). 6.Selective outcome reporting: low risk of bias (all the prespecified outcomes of interest were reported); high risk of bias (not all the prespecified outcomes of interest were reported, outcomes assessed using measurements which were not prespecified, incomplete reporting of outcome data); or unclear risk of bias (if there is insuﬀicient information to judge whether there is a high or low risk).
7.Other sources of bias: low risk of bias (the study appears to be free of other sources of bias); high risk of bias (presence of other source(s) of bias); or unclear risk of bias (if there is insuﬀicient information to judge whether there is a high or low risk). NRSIs For NRSIs with a control or comparator group, including controlled before-and-a/f_ter and cohort study designs, we will use the validated 'Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions' (ROBINS-I) tool to assess risk of bias (Sterne 2016; Sterne 2022).In each domain, we will assign a judgment of 'low risk of bias', 'moderate risk of bias', 'serious risk of bias', 'critical risk of bias', and 'no information' (Sterne 2016; Sterne 2022).
We will implement ROBINS-I in a six-step process, which includes: 1.specify the research question through consideration of a target trial; 2.specify the outcome and result being assessed; 3.for the specified result, examine how the confounders and co- interventions were addressed; 4.answer signaling questions for the seven bias domains; 5.formulate risk of bias judgments for each of the seven bias domains, informed by answers to the signaling questions; and Vitamin B supplementation for sickle cell disease (Protocol) Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.6 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 6.formulate an overall judgment on risk of bias for the outcome and result being assessed.The ROBINS-I assesses risk of bias at three levels (using seven domains with appropriate signaling questions); namely pre- intervention, at intervention, and post-intervention.
Explanations of the domain-level judgments are presented in the appendices (Appendix 2). The two review authors will not be blinded to the names of study authors, institutions, journals and results of included trials.If there are concerns or issues, the review authors will resolve them by discussion or with the opinion of a third review author (PAC).We will record results in the relevant 'Characteristics of included studies' tables and summarized them in a risk of bias table or graph in/uni00A0Review Manager 2020.Measures of treatment eﬀect Dichotomous data For dichotomous data (i.e.SCD-related morbidities, adverse eﬀects of supplementation), we will present results using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Count data For count data on number of study participants with at least one episode of vaso-occlusive pain, acute chest syndrome, or infection, we will present results using the RR with 95% CIs.Continuous data For continuous outcomes (i.e.
hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, measures of plasma and serum B vitamin status), we will present the results using the mean diﬀerence (MD) and the corresponding 95% CIs for outcomes using the same scale between trials. We will standardize the results to a uniform scale.To do this, we will standardize the MD and the 95% CI if the same outcome is measured in a variety of ways (i.e.diﬀerent scales).For continuous outcomes in NRSIs, we will extract and report the absolute change adjusting for baseline diﬀerences (including regression models, mixed models or hierarchical models).If the relative change adjusted for baseline diﬀerences in outcome measures is available (i.e.absolute postintervention diﬀerence between intervention and control groups, as relative change is reported (post-intervention diﬀerence divided by postintervention level in control group)), we will extract and report these data.
For ITS studies that meet the previously described criteria of analysis and from which we can extract relevant information, we will determine the eﬀect sizes by standardizing the data by dividing the level (or time slope) and standard error (SE) by the standard deviation (SD) of the pre-intervention slope. Where appropriate, we will report the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) with 95% CIs.We will present the data in tables or a narrative report if we cannot report the available data in any of the formats mentioned above.For the included NRSIs, we will consider and evaluate confounding, and we will make the required adjustment for the change of outcomes (EPOC 2017).
For binary outcomes in longitudinal cohort studies, we will meta-analyze the eﬀect size as appropriate (hazard ratio (HR)in the time-to-event Cox proportional hazards regression model, cumulative risk in logistic regression model). For continuous outcomes in longitudinal cohort studies with multiple observations per individual, we will meta-analyze the eﬀect size using estimates that convey the association of exposure with average level of the outcome, and the association of the exposure with the slope of change in the outcome.Unit of analysis issues Cluster-RCTs To address unit of analysis issues, we will use methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to adjust sample size and measures of variation (e.g.standard errors) for level of randomization reported in trials (Higgins 2017b ).
If reported, we will use the intra-cluster correlation coeﬀicient (ICC) to estimate the design eﬀect, based on guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2017b ). Where ICCs are not available, we will apply ICCs from studies of similar interventions.We will undertake sensitivity analysis based on ICCs to examine the eﬀect of combining results from cRCTs and individually randomized studies to synthesize the relevant information.Studies with multiple treatment groups The unit of analysis will be the individual participant.Where a single study reports multiple study arms, we will include only the arms that meet our eligibility criteria.If two comparisons are combined in the same meta-analysis, we will halve the comparison group to avoid double-counting (Higgins 2022).We will describe studies with multiple treatment groups in the characteristics of included studies table.
Multiple time points We will extract data at multiple time points from baseline to the postintervention period as reported by study authors. We will pool data from studies for outcomes reported at similar time points in the meta-analysis.Where diﬀerent time points for outcomes exist between trials, we will analyze these according to short-term, medium-term and long-term time points.Cross-over studies For cross-over studies, we plan to include a paired analysis from the two study periods.If there is a carry-over eﬀect, or where second-period data are not available, we will collect the MD of the measurement between the experimental intervention and control intervention of each group and its SE.Following this, the review authors will meta-analyze eﬀect sizes and SEs using the generic inverse method in/uni00A0Review Manager 2020.When combining results from cross-over studies in a meta-analysis, we plan to use the methods recommended by/uni00A0Elbourne 2002 .
NRSIs NRSIs may include data measured over multiple time points. Since these data usually have a correlated structure, we plan to analyze the data based on predefined time points (short term, medium term, and long term), adjusting for confounding.We will follow Cochrane Eﬀective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) recommendations for unit of analysis issues that may arise with the inclusion of ITS studies (EPOC 2017).We will use the preferred Vitamin B supplementation for sickle cell disease (Protocol) Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.7 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews method of a statistical comparison of time trends before and a/f_ter the intervention to analyze ITS studies.
Dealing with missing data If we identify studies which have been published only in abstract form or presented at meetings or conferences, we will contact the investigator for full reports and data as needed. If there are missing or unclear data in relation to attrition rates with no reported reason for dropout, we will request further information from the study authors.In order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we will collect data on the number of participants with each outcome event by allocated treatment group (regardless of compliance and whether participants were later excluded from treatment or found to be ineligible).Assessment of heterogeneity The review authors plan to assess the heterogeneity through visual examination of the overlap of CIs presented in the forest plots.We will use the Chi/two.sups test and a P value less than 0.10 to determine statistically significant heterogeneity.
The authors will also use the I/two.sups statistic to quantify any heterogeneity across the studies. We will categorize and interpret the I/two.sups statistic using the following classification (Deeks 2022; Higgins 2003): 1.0% to 40%: might not be important level of heterogeneity; 2.30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 3.50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 4.75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.We anticipate that heterogeneity may be a concern in NRSIs.Where there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity (50% to 90%), we will summarize findings and present them using a forest plot, but will not present the pooled estimate.We will also consider informal methods to explore heterogeneity in NRSIs by structuring figures by hypothesized modifiers such as methodological characteristics (e.g.study design), subpopulations (e.g.sex, age), intervention components, or contextual and setting factors (e.g.
clinic versus community-based intervention)/uni00A0(McKenzie 2022). Assessment of reporting biases In order to identify selective outcome reporting, the review authors will compare outcomes described in the study protocol (if available) with those reported in the publication.If the protocol is not available, information about outcomes may be found in the study registry databases.The review authors will also compare outcomes listed in the 'Methods' section of the final paper with those presented in the 'Results' section.If 10 or more studies are included in the meta-analysis, we plan to use a funnel plot to assess publication bias.If the funnel plot is asymmetrical, we will explore the causes.Data synthesis We will pool the results and perform a meta-analysis for studies of similar methodological design, population and intervention.We will conduct separate meta-analyses for RCTs and NSRIs with similar methodological design, providing the data are available.
We will analyze data using/uni00A0Review Manager 2020. Since we anticipate that heterogeneity will be present between studies, we will use a random-eﬀects model to analyze data.We will use the inverse variance method for continuous variables.For dichotomousvariables, we will use the method proposed by Mantel and Haenszel (Deeks 2022).We will use the generic inverse variance method in/uni00A0Review Manager 2020/uni00A0to perform meta-analysis for NRSIs with a control or comparator group in which results have been adjusted for confounding factors.If study reports provide both adjusted and non-adjusted estimates, we will carry out sensitivity analysis using unadjusted figures to determine the possible impact on the estimate of the treatment eﬀect.We will use a random-eﬀects model as there is likely to be some level of heterogeneity (as defined above), particularly between the NSRIs.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity If the authors are able to include suﬀicient studies (at least 10) in a meta-analysis and identify at least 50% heterogeneity, we plan to undertake the following subgroup analyses. 1.Vitamin B supplementation a.Vitamin B supplementation complex combination versus single B vitamin b.Vitamin B supplementation complex combination versus single B vitamin + other B vitamins c.Vitamin B supplementation complex combination versus any combination of B vitamins + iron 2.Diﬀerent types of SCD a.severe genotypes (HbSS and HbSβº) versus mild genotypes (HbSC, HbSβ +and rare variants) 3.Demographic status a.children (under 18 years of age) versus adults (18 years of age and older) b.males versus females 4.Baseline nutritional status: if there is evidence for heterogeneity in the meta-analyzed eﬀect estimates, then we will use meta- regression analyses to assess whether background nutriture contributes to heterogeneity in the eﬀect.
5.Participants being treated with hydroxyurea as standard of care versus those not being treated with hydroxyurea. Sensitivity analysis We will conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the findings.If we are able to include 10 or more studies in a meta- analysis, we plan to perform a sensitivity analysis and we will report sensitivity analyses data in summary tables.We will examine the eﬀect of excluding RCTs that are classified as having a high risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding.Similarly, we will perform sensitivity analysis for NSRIs classified as having serious or critical for bias due to confounding, selection of participants, classification of intervention, and deviations from the intended intervention.We plan to repeat the meta-analyses using a fixed-eﬀect model to assess the robustness of the findings based on the analysis method.
Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence We will create a summary of findings table for each comparison listed above using the following outcome measures. Vitamin B supplementation for sickle cell disease (Protocol) Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.8 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 1.Hemoglobin concentration 2.Mean corpuscular volume 3.SCD-related morbidities - pain episodes 4.SCD-related morbidities - acute chest syndrome 5.SCD-related morbidities - complications of the central nervous system 6.SCD-related morbidities – infection 7.B vitamin concentration We will create separate summary of findings tables for randomized and non-randomized studies.We will use the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence (Balshem 2011 ).
The tables will include the seven outcomes listed above for each comparison, estimates of relative eﬀects, and the number of participants and studies contributing data for these outcomes. Limiting the assessment to the included studies, we will use the GRADEapproach to assess within-study risk of bias, heterogeneity, precision of eﬀect estimates, directness of evidence, and risk of publication bias.We will express the certainty of the evidence from the included studies as one of four levels (high, moderate, low, or very low).We will use GRADEpro so/f_tware (GRADEpro).A C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S We would like to acknowledge and thank the Managing Editor of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group, Tracey Remmington, for her support in the preparation of this protocol.This project was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), via Cochrane Infrastructure funding to the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group.
