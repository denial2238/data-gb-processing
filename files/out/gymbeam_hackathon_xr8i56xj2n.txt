and bone loss, these relationships were not present when other factors were included in a multivariate model.These ﬁndings suggest PD by itself may not be a risk factor for bone loss but may re ﬂect the similarity in the risk fac- tors for both conditions.

In searchingfor additional ligands of the GABA B1R/CaSR heterodimer, we found upregulation of a putative GABA B1R ligand, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and one of its derivatives,β-amyloid (A β 1-42) in the parathyroid adenoma of PHPT pa- tients verse age-matched normal PTGs (p <0.005) by in situ proteomic pro ﬁling. Those tumors also showed increased levels of the proteolytic enzymes, β-secretase and γ-secretase, that make A β1-42and enhanced phosphoryl- ation of the microtubule-associated protein TAU, a down-stream effector of A β 1-42-induced signaling in the degenerative neurons of dementia patients.
Adding exogen-ous A β 1-42(0.3 to 1000 nM) in cultures concentration- dependently stimulated tonic PTH secretion by up toA192 | Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A192 1.6-fold in murine (p <0.001 vs control) and 1.9-fold in hu- man PTGs (p =0.03 vs control) without shifting the Ca2 +-set point. This stimulatory effect was absent in murine PTGs lacking either CaSR or GABA B1R.Furthermore, parathyroid cell (PTC)-speci ﬁc knockout (KO) of the App (PTCAppΔﬂox/Δﬂox) gene to remove A β1-42or the Gabbr1 (PTCGabbr1Δﬂox/Δﬂox) gene to disrupt GABA B1R/CaSR het- erodimer similarly reduced tonic PTH secretion in PTG cul-tures and produced hypoparathyroidism in vivo , supporting a role for A β 1-42as a ligand in stimulating PTH secretion viaGABA B1R/CaSR heterodimer.
The prote- omic pro ﬁles revealed a signi ﬁcant inverse correlation be- tween the pre-operative 25OHD levels of PHPT patientsand increased Tau phosphorylation in their PTG tumors(r 2=0.225, p <0.0001), suggesting a role for Tau signaling in stimulating PTH secretion in 25OHD de ﬁciency. In sup- port of this idea, inhibition of Tau phosphorylation by astaurosporine analogue (K252a) blocked the ability ofAβ 1-42to stimulate PTH secretion in vitro , and the in- creased tonic PTH hypersecretion seen in mice withPTC-targeted Vdr gene KO ( PTCVdrΔﬂox/Δﬂox), mimicking vitamin D de ﬁciency, was reversed by a concurrent ablation ofApp (PTCVdrΔﬂox/Δﬂox;AppΔﬂox/Δﬂox)or the TAU-encoding Mapt (PTCVdrΔﬂox/Δﬂox;Mapt-/-) gene.Collectively, we dem- onstrate novel roles of A β1-42/p-Tau signaling in sustaining tonic PTH secretion in physiological states and in promot-ing PTH hypersecretion due to 25OHD de ﬁciency.
