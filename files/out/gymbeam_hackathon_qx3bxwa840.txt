Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer’s disease, share a common pathophysiological link involving insulin resistance (IR), inﬂammation, and hypertension.
Aluminium chloride (AlCl 3), a known neurotoxicant, has been associated with neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and various organ dysfunctions due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of metformin and vitamin E against AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbances in rat models.Rats were divided into ﬁve groups: a normal control group, an AlCl 3-treated diseased group without any treatment, and three groups exposed to AlCl 3and subsequently administered with metformin (100 mg/kg/day) alone, vitamin E (150 mg/kg/day) orally alone, or a combination of metformin (100 mg/kg/day) and vitamin E (150 mg/kg/day) for 45 days.We analyzed serum biomarkers and histopathological changes in brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues using H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC).Electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns were observed for all groups.
The AlCl 3-treated group showed elevated levels of inﬂammatory biomarkers, MDA, and disturbances in glycemic and lipid proﬁles, along with reduced insulin levels. However, treatment with the combination of metformin and vitamin E resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced glucose, cholesterol, LDL, and TG levels, accompanied by increased insulin and HDL levels compared to the individual treatment groups.Histopathological analyses revealed that combination therapy preserved neuronal structures, muscle cell nuclei, and normal morphology in the brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues.IHC demonstrated reduced amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles in the combination-treated group compared to the AlCl 3-treated group.Moreover, the combination group showed a normal ECG pattern, contrasting the altered pattern observed in the AlCl 3-treated group.
Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that metformin and vitamin E, in combination, possess neuroprotective and cardiometabolic effects, alleviating AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and metabolic disturbances.

Understanding this association is essential for developing therapeutic strategies that target neuroinﬂammation alongside traditional metabolic pathways to manage cardiometabolic diseases and potentially delay neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study’s results on met- formin and vitamin E’s protective effects offer valuable insights into potential treatments that modulate both brain and peripheral organ function to promote overall health.Cardiometabolic disorder is a complex condition characterized by a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).The precise underlying pathways re- sponsible for its development remain unclear; however, IR is believed to be a signiﬁcant contributor to cardiometabolic disorder.IR poses a substantial risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), leading to renal sodium ion reabsorption and vasoconstriction and ultimately resulting in hypertension.
Common features of cardiometabolic disorder include obesity, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [ 1]. On the other hand, AD is a neu- rodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of cortical and hippocampal neurons, leading to cognitive dysfunction, learning deﬁcits, and memory impairment.AD has been linked to dementia in adults and elders, with global estimates showing that more than 40 million people were affected by dementia in 2016 [ 2].The pathogenesis of AD involves the accumulation of intracellular neuroﬁbrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques, resulting in extensive neuronal damage and loss of functional activity in affected individuals.Additionally, AD is associated with various pathological attributes, including neuroinﬂammation, oxidative stress, and degeneration of cholinergic neurons, all of which contribute to hippocampal neuron damage and memory loss [3].
Age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative and cardiometabolic disorders, have been associated with disruptions in both the cardiovascular and neurological systems, as well as alterations in behavior. Inorganic compounds, such as AlCl 3, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of disorders like AD, neuroinﬂammation, CVD, and IR.AlCl 3adversely affects oxidative signaling pathways, leading to neural tissue damage, the formation of amyloid- βplaques, cognitive decline, neuroinﬂammation, and, ultimately, neuronal cell death.Additionally, exposure to AlCl 3leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species, causing lipid peroxidation, vasoconstriction, insulin resistance, and disturbances in both cardiovascular and glycemic status [4,5].Inﬂammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disturbances.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are second messengers that modulate neuroinﬂammation at various stages through redox- sensitive mechanisms. Additionally, excessive ROS production or redox dysregulation under oxidative stress damages cells, leading to glucose dysregulation.A pronounced as- trocyte response can produce danger signals that trigger neuroinﬂammation and metabolic disturbances [6].Furthermore, exposure to AlCl 3increases the protein expression of IL signaling path- ways and ROS, which play central roles in the hippocampus.This indicates that AlCl 3 activates IL signaling pathways and oxidative stress.The activation of astrocytes, microglia, and ROS, along with elevated levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, are characteristic features of AD and IR [ 7].The proliferation and activation of astrocytes and microglia results in the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tu- mor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Evidence suggests that IL-6 contributes to neuroinﬂammation, thereby inducing neurodegenerative diseases. Addition- ally, overexpression of IL-6 is a common factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases [8].Previous investigations have suggested that metformin holds potential to improve neuroinﬂammation and AD due to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and its potent insulin-sensitizing action [ 9].Researchers have revealed that the beneﬁcial effects of metformin on cognitive dysfunction and memory are likely mediated through the reduction of IR and oxidative stress [ 10].Likewise, a randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrated that metformin reduces the risk of microvascular and macrovascular diseases, Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 3 of 24 such as myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac failure, and coronary artery disease [ 11,12].
Metformin’s activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) represents a promising approach for managing cardiac diseases like atherosclerosis and MI. This is achieved through the improvement of mitochondrial and endothelial dysfunction, attenuation of inﬂammatory reactions, and reduction in oxidative stress [13,14].IR and neuroinﬂammation are interconnected, leading to a pro-inﬂammatory state regulated by cytokines that might contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.Recent research has uncovered associations between hyper- glycemia, oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and lipoperoxidation products.These factors are linked to abnormal cellular accumulation of reactive dicarbonyl metabolites, which con- tribute to cell and tissue dysfunction in numerous diseases and during aging.
Metformin, as evidenced by recent studies, offers protective effects against inﬂammation, leading to an improvement in metabolic disturbances and oxidative stress [ 15]. Moreover, metformin exhibits antioxidant properties and plays a neuroprotective role while also enhancing glucose metabolism.Notably, metformin has demonstrated the ability to stimulate neu- rogenesis and enhance spatial memory.In addition to its beneﬁts, metformin ameliorates dyslipidemia and IR, and it reveals cardioprotective effects by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, interleukins (ILs), and dicarbonyl metabolites [16].Some non-interventional studies have suggested that vitamin E may play a role in the prevention of cardiometabolic disorders, AD, and neuroinﬂammation.Vitamin E exhibits numerous biological actions, serving as an antioxidant to scavenge toxic free radicals.
The proposition that free radicals contribute to the pathological processes underlying cognitive dysfunction has raised interest in the potential use of vitamin E for the treatment of cognitive impairment and memory deﬁcits [ 17]. According to the European Society of Cardiology, CVDs remain the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in both men and women, particularly in low-income countries.Currently available information suggests that vitamin E might be critical in reducing the risk of CVDs, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.Vitamin E is considered a vital antioxidant, primarily responsible for protecting lipids from oxidative damage [ 18,19].Several studies have demonstrated the protective role of vitamin E in CVDs, attributed to its ability to regulate gene expression, cholesterol metabolism, signaling pathways, and maintaining plaque stability [18,19].
Studies have suggested that vitamin E has positive effects on cell membrane ﬂuidity, oxidative stress, and inﬂammation in the brains of experimentally induced diabetic rats. Vitamin E is perceived to be effective in supporting the antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory defense systems.The research revealed a reduction in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in the generation of oxidative damaging substances and cytokines.Moreover, it maintained the ﬂuidity of the brain’s membranes in the rats [ 20,21].The purpose of this study was to shed light on the potential neuroprotective and cardiometabolic beneﬁts of metformin and vitamin E in the context of AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance.Ultimately, the main concern of this study is to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the ﬁeld of neuroprotection and cardiometabolic health, offering promising avenues for further research and potential clinical applications.2.
Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Design for the Induction of Neuroinflammation and Cardiometabolic Disturbance Approximately 30 adult Wistar rats weighing approximately 150–200 g were obtained locally and housed in the animal facility of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF), Pakistan, at an ambient temperature of 25 ±5◦C.The rats were provided with a standard diet and had access to water ad libitum.An acclimation period of one week was allowed before commencing the experimental procedures.All experimental protocols adhered to the approved guidelines of the Institutional Biosafety and Bioethics Committee (IBC) of UAF (No.2857/ORIC).Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 4 of 24 Following the acclimation period, the rats were equally divided into ﬁve groups (n = 6).Group 1 served as the control group and received a normal diet and water ad libitum for 45 days.Group 2 was designated as the diseased group and received AlCl 3 at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day.
The remaining groups were also exposed to AlCl 3at 50 mg/kg/day and subsequently received different treatments. Group 3 received treatment I, consisting of metformin at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day.Group 4 received treatment II, comprising vitamin E at a dosage of 150 mg/kg/day administered orally.Group 5 was the combination group, receiving both metformin at 100 mg/kg/day and vitamin E at 150 mg/kg/day.2.2.Blood and Tissue Sampling Approximately 1.5–2.5 mL of blood was collected from each rat in all groups at 0, 15, 30, and 45 days of the treatment duration using the tail vein method for biochemical analysis of relevant biomarkers.Following collection, the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10–20 min to separate the serum, which was then stored at −20◦C until further analysis.At the conclusion of the study, various organ tissues, including the heart, brain, and pancreas, were dissected and separated for histopathological examination, immunochemistry, and ﬁbrosis analysis.
2.3. Biochemical Analysis The serum was utilized to measure various biochemical parameters, including the glycemic proﬁle (glucose, insulin, and HbA1c), lipid proﬁle (HDL, LDL, cholesterol, TG), lipid peroxidation analysis (MDA), and inﬂammatory biomarkers.2.4.Assessment of Glycemic Status Measuring glucose, insulin, and HbA1c levels in neuroinflammation and cardiometabolic disturbance is important because these parameters reﬂect the status of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.Elevated glucose levels can indicate impaired glucose regulation, while insulin levels provide insights into insulin resistance and pancreatic function.HbA1c, a long-term marker of average blood glucose levels, helps assess glycemic control over time, providing valuable information about the risk of diabetes and its complications in the context of neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbances.In each group, the serum level of glucose was determined using the glucose assay kit (cat no.
1004, Elabscience) and measured with a Microlab 300 chemistry analyzer (ELITech Group) to assess the effects of metformin and vitamin E on glycemic status. Additionally, HbA1c and insulin levels in the serum were quantiﬁed using their respective ELISA kits: the insulin ELISA kit (cat no.INS 5275, Elabscience) and the HbA1c ELISA kit (cat no.SG10984, Elabscience) were utilized, and readings were obtained through a microplate ELISA reader (BIOBASE-EL 10A).2.5.Assessment of Lipid Proﬁle Measuring the lipid proﬁle in neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance is essential because these conditions are associated with altered lipid metabolism, which can lead to dyslipidemia.Monitoring lipid levels, including cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL, helps assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which are often linked to neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disorders.
Abnormal lipid proﬁles can contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis and other vascular complications, making lipid assessment crucial for understanding the overall cardiovascular health in these conditions. The serum levels of lipids were measured from the collected animal samples.Choles- terol (cat no.1011, Elabscience), TG (cat no.090618, Elabscience), HDL (cat no.6011668, Elabscience), and LDL (cat no.6011668, Elabscience) concentrations in the serum were quantiﬁed using a Microlab 300 chemistry analyzer.Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 5 of 24 2.6.Assessment of Liver Function Enzymes The measurement of serum levels of AST (Aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (Ala- nine aminotransferase) is important in neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance because these enzymes are primarily found in the liver and released into the bloodstream when there is liver damage or dysfunction.
Neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic dis- turbances can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage, including the liver. Elevated AST and ALT levels serve as important biomarkers to assess liver health and the extent of tissue damage in these conditions.Monitoring these liver enzymes can provide valuable insights into the overall health and potential complications associated with neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbances.The serum levels of AST, ALT, and hexokinase were measured using the AST assay kit (cat no.BD088918) and the ALT assay kit (cat no.BD088918) on the Microlab 300 chemistry analyzer.Additionally, the hexokinase levels were quantiﬁed using the hexokinase assay kit (cat No.EEL-M146, Elabscience) and read with a microplate ELISA reader.2.7.
Assessment of Inﬂammatory Biomarkers Measuring the serum level of IL-6 in neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic distur- bance is essential because IL-6 is a key pro-inﬂammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune response and inﬂammatory processes. Elevated levels of IL-6 can indicate the presence and severity of inﬂammation, and its measurement helps in understanding the immune and inﬂammatory status in these conditions.The serum level of IL-6 was measured using an IL-6 ELISA kit (E-ELR0015, Elabscience) with a microplate ELISA reader.2.8.Assessment of Lipid Peroxidation Biomarker Measuring the serum level of MDA in neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic dis- turbance is important because MDA is a biomarker of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.Elevated levels of MDA can indicate increased oxidative damage, which is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disorders.
MDA, an end product of lipid peroxidation and a well-established oxidative stress biomarker, was evaluated using an MDA ELISA kit (cat no. E-EL 0060, Elabscience) with a microplate ELISA reader.2.9.Analysis of ECG Pattern Measuring the ECG pattern in neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance is crucial because it provides valuable information about the electrical activity and rhythm of the heart.Changes in the ECG pattern can indicate cardiac dysfunction or arrhyth- mias, which are common complications associated with neuroinﬂammation and car- diometabolic disorders.After administering anesthesia, the animals from each experimental group were laid ﬂat on the working slab.Electrodes were connected to each arm of the animal, and the standard leads were positioned on the palms of the left and right limbs.The grounded lead was attached to the right hind foot.
Subsequently, the Bio Amp cable was plugged into the Bio Amp input, and electric signals were generated and recorded by a device connected to the Power-Lab. 2.10.Histopathological Examination of Heart, Brain, and Pancreatic Tissues Hematoxylin and eosin tissue staining : Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) tissue stain- ing was performed in this study to examine the overall histological changes in brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues in response to neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance induced by AlCl 3.H&E staining allowed for visualization and assessment of cellular morphology, detection of abnormalities, and evaluation of the structural integrity of the tissues, providing important insights into the impact of the treatments on tissue health.
To investigate the effects of metformin, vitamin E, and the combination of metformin and vitamin E on the morphology of brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues, the rats were eutha- Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 6 of 24 nized using cervical dislocation. Subsequently, the skull and abdomen were dissected, and the brain, heart, and pancreas were carefully separated for histopathological examination.The tissue samples were subjected to a series of standard procedures, including ﬁxation, embedding, sectioning, mounting, and staining, following the established protocol.Brieﬂy, slices of brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues were preserved in 10% formalin solution.The tissue sections were then washed and rehydrated using alcohol.Subsequently, all tissue sections were transferred to a xylene solution for clearing.Afterward, the sections were immersed in liquid parafﬁn for approximately 2 h and allowed to ﬁx in parafﬁn wax.
Later, the tissue sections were stained with H&E stain and covered with a glass coverslip for subsequent analysis and examination under a microscope. Masson’s trichrome tissue staining : Masson’s trichrome tissue staining was per- formed in this study to assess the extent of ﬁbrosis and collagen deposition in the heart and pancreatic tissues, which are associated with cardiometabolic disturbances.This staining technique allowed the researchers to visualize and quantify the ﬁbrotic changes, provid- ing valuable information about tissue remodeling and pathological alterations in these organs.Masson’s trichrome staining was performed to detect collagen ﬁbers in the brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues.The tissue samples were ﬁrst preserved in formalin, and parafﬁn-embedded sections were prepared and stored.To begin the staining process, all tissue slides were deparafﬁnized by heating and then rehydrated sequentially through 70%, 95%, and 100% alcohol.
Distilled water was used for washing. The tissue slides were then treated with Bouin’s solution and heated at 56◦C for 1 min.Following this, they were allowed to stand for 15 min and then washed with water for 5 min.Next, the slides were stained with Weigert’s iron hematoxylin solution for 10 min and rinsed with warm water for 10 min.After washing with distilled water, the slides were immersed and stained in Biebrich scarlet acid fuchsin for 15 min.Subsequently, the tissue slides were washed with distilled water and immersed in a phosphomolybdic/phosphotungstic acid solution for 15 min.Further, the slides were stained with aniline blue solution for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water.To complete the staining process, the slides were placed in a 1% acetic acid solution for 2 min, followed by washing with distilled water.Finally, the slides were dehydrated by sequential immersion in 95% ethanol and absolute alcohol and cleared in xylene before being mounted.
Immunohistochemistry : Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in this study to investigate the presence and distribution of speciﬁc proteins or biomarkers related to neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbances in the brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues. By utilizing IHC, the researchers were able to visualize and quantify the expres- sion of target proteins, such as amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles in the brain, which are crucial in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these conditions and assessing the efﬁcacy of the treatment interventions.Brain tissue sections, approximately 3–5 microns in thickness and embedded in parafﬁn, were cut and mounted onto micro- scopic slides.The slides were air-dried for approximately 2 h at 58◦C and subsequently underwent deparafﬁnization and rehydration.To facilitate heat-induced epitope retrieval, the tissue slides were exposed to an immuno-DNA retriever solution containing citrate.
The slides were placed in a staining dish with the immuno-DNA retriever solution and then positioned on a trivet inside a pressure cooker. Approximately 1–2 inches of distilled water was added to the pressure cooker, and the heat was set to high.The slides were incubated under pressure for approximately 15 min.Afterward, the pressure cooker was opened, and the slides were allowed to cool to room temperature.To complete the process, the slides were mounted using biodegradable permanent mounting medium [X Green PermaMounter (BB0169-0174)].2.11.Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis of the study data was performed using ANOVA followed by post hoc tests to compare multiple groups.The results were presented as mean ±standard deviation (SD) or standard error of mean (SEM), and statistical signiﬁcance was determined Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 7 of 24 using p-values.A signiﬁcance level of p< 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Additionally, graphs and ﬁgures were used to visualize the data distribution and trends. 3.Results 3.1.Effect of Treatment on Glycemic Status The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on serum levels of glucose (Figure 1A) and insulin (Figure 1B) were assessed at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the study duration.The experimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.Upon exposure to AlCl 3, the serum levels of glucose signiﬁcantly increased ( p< 0.001) at 15, 30, and 45 days, while the insulin levels decreased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.001) at the same time points.These ﬁndings suggest the development of insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis in response to AlCl 3exposure.Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 25 The slides were placed in a staining dish with the immuno-DNA retriever solution and then positioned on a trivet inside a pressure cooker.
Approximately 1–2 inches of distilled water was added to the pressure cooker, and the heat was set to high. The slides were incubated under pressure for approximately 15 min.Afterward, the pressure cooker was opened, and the slides were allowed to cool to room temperature.To complete the pro- cess, the slides were mounted using biod egradable permanent mounting medium [X Green PermaMounter (BB0169-0174)].2.11.Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis of the study da ta was performed using ANOVA followed by post hoc tests to compare multiple groups.Th e results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error of mean (SEM ), and statistical significance was determined using p-values.A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Addi- tionally, graphs and figures were used to visualize the data distribution and trends.3.Results 3.1.
Eﬀect of Treatment on Glycemic Status The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on serum levels of glucose (Figure 1A) and insulin (Figure 1B) were assessed at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the study duration. The experimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3 at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.Upon exposure to AlCl 3, the serum levels of glucose significantly increased ( p < 0.001) at 15, 30, and 45 days, while the insulin levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001) at the same time points.These find ings suggest the development of insulin re- sistance and dysregulation of glucos e homeostasis in response to AlCl 3 exposure.On the other hand, the groups treated wi th metformin and vitamin E showed inter- esting results.At 15 days , both metformin and vitamin E treatments led to a signi ﬁcant increase in serum insulin levels ( p < 0.05) compared to the AlCl 3-exposed group, indicating a potential improvement in insulin sensitivity.
At 30 days, the combination of metformin and vitamin E resulted in a more pronounced increase in serum insulin levels compared to either treatment alone ( p < 0.01), demonstrating a synergistic e ﬀect of the combined therapy in enhancing insulin secretion or action.

At 30 days, the combination of metformin and vitamin E resulted in a more pronounced increase in serum insulin levels compared to either treatment alone ( p< 0.01), demonstrating a synergistic effect of the combined therapy in enhancing insulin secretion or action. Furthermore, at 15 and 30 days, the combination group exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in serum glucose levels ( p< 0.05) compared to the AlCl 3-exposed group, indicating an improvement in glucose regulation.Interestingly, at 30 days of treatment duration, the combination group also showed a signiﬁcant decline in serum glucose levels ( p< 0.01) compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone groups, indicating a superior effect of the combined treatment in lowering glucose levels.
At 45 days of study duration, the metformin group showed an increased level of insulin ( p< 0.01) and a decrease in glucose levels ( p< 0.01) compared to the vitamin E group, suggesting that metformin has a more potent effect on insulin regulation and glucose control in the longer term. Notably, the combination group demonstrated the most favorable outcomes, showing a signiﬁcant decrease in serum glucose levels ( p< 0.001) and a marked increase in serum insulin levels ( p< 0.001) compared to all other groups at the 45-day study period.These Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 8 of 24 results highlight the potential synergistic effects of metformin and vitamin E in improv- ing both insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, which may have implications for managing insulin resistance, cardiometabolic disorders, and Alzheimer’s disease.
Nev- ertheless, further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these effects and to assess the long-term effects of this combination therapy on overall health and disease prevention. 3.2.Effect of Treatment on Lipid Status The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on serum levels of cholesterol (Figure 2A), triglycerides (TG) (Figure 2B), HDL (Figure 2C), and LDL (Figure 2D) were measured at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the study duration.The experimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 25 Figure 2.Eﬀect of treatment on serum levels of cholesterol ( A), TG ( B), HDL ( C), and LDL ( D) at 15, 30, and 45 days of the treatment period.The level of signi ﬁcant diﬀerence was estimated by Bonfer- roni post hoc test using two-way ANOVA.a represents p < 0.001 when compared with control group at all sampling points.

At 15 and 30 days, both metformin and vitamin E treatments led to a signiﬁcant increase in serum HDL levels ( p< 0.05) and a decrease in serum levels of cholesterol ( p< 0.01), LDL ( p< 0.01), and TG ( p< 0.01) compared to the AlCl 3-exposed group. These ﬁndings suggest potential beneﬁts of metformin and vitamin E in improving lipid metabolism and reducing lipid abnormalities.Interestingly, the combination group exhibited the most signiﬁcant effects at 30 days of treatment duration.Compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone treatment groups, the combination therapy showed maximum improvement in HDL levels ( p< 0.001) and the most pronounced reduction in serum levels of cholesterol ( p< 0.001), TG ( p< 0.001), and LDL ( p< 0.001).At 45 days of study duration, the metformin group also demonstrated better effects (p< 0.01) compared to the vitamin E group in terms of improving lipid levels.
However, the combination group showed the most favorable outcomes, displaying a remarkable decline in serum levels of cholesterol ( p< 0.001), TG ( p< 0.001), and LDL ( p< 0.001), along with a signiﬁcant elevation in serum HDL levels ( p< 0.001) at the 45-day study period. These results suggest that the combination of metformin and vitamin E has potent lipid-regulating effects, which may be crucial in mitigating the risk of cardiometabolic disorders.These ﬁndings highlight the potential therapeutic beneﬁts of combining metformin and vitamin E in managing dyslipidemia and maintaining a healthy lipid proﬁle.Never- theless, further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects and to assess the long-term impacts of this combination therapy on cardiovascular and metabolic health.3.3.
Effect of Treatment on Liver Enzymes and Glycolysis The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on serum levels of liver enzymes AST (Figure 3A), ALT (Figure 3B), ALP (Figure 3C), and hexokinase (Figure 3D) were measured at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the study duration. The experimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.Following exposure to AlCl 3, there was a signiﬁcant elevation in serum levels of AST (p< 0.001), ALT ( p< 0.001), and ALP ( p< 0.001), indicating liver injury and dysfunction.Additionally, a decline in the serum level of hexokinase ( p< 0.001) was observed, suggesting impaired glucose metabolism in the liver.In contrast, both the metformin and vitamin E groups demonstrated beneﬁcial effects on liver enzyme levels at 15 and 30 days.
These treatments led to a signiﬁcant decrease in serum levels of ALT ( p< 0.05), AST ( p< 0.05), and ALP ( p< 0.05), indicating a potential improvement in liver function and reduced liver damage. Furthermore, these groups exhibited a notable increase in the serum level of hexokinase ( p< 0.01), suggesting enhanced glucose metabolism in the liver.Remarkably, the combination group demonstrated the most signiﬁcant effects at 15 and 30 days of treatment duration.Compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone treatment groups, the combination therapy showed more pronounced reductions in serum levels of ALT ( p< 0.001), AST ( p< 0.001), and ALP ( p< 0.001), indicating a superior protective effect on liver function.Additionally, the combination group displayed the most substantial increase in serum hexokinase levels ( p< 0.001), indicating enhanced glucose metabolism in the liver.
At 45 days of study duration, the combination group continued to show the most favorable outcomes, displaying a remarkable decline in serum levels of ALT (p< 0.001), AST ( p< 0.001), and ALP ( p< 0.001), along with a signiﬁcant elevation in serum hexokinase levels ( p< 0.001). These results indicate that the combination of metformin and vitamin E has potent hepatoprotective effects, which may be crucial in mitigating liver injury induced by AlCl 3exposure and maintaining liver function.These ﬁndings underscore the potential therapeutic beneﬁts of combining metformin and vitamin E in protecting liver health and improving glucose metabolism.However, fur- Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 10 of 24 ther studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects and to assess the long-term impacts of this combination therapy on liver function and overall health.Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 25 Figure 3.
Eﬀect of treatment on serum level of AST ( A), ALT ( B), ALP ( C), and hexokinase ( D). The eﬀect of treatment on serum levels of AST, ALT, AL P, and hexokinase was meas ured at 0, 15, 30, and 45 days of the treatment period.The level of signi ﬁcant diﬀerence was estimated by Bonferroni post hoc test using two-way ANOVA.a represents p < 0.001 when compared with control group at all sampling points.b represents p < 0.001 when compared with AlCl 3-treated group.c represents p < 0.01 when compared with MTF-treated group.d represents p < 0.01 when compared with VIT-E- treated group.Abbreviations | CON: Control, AlCl 3: Aluminium chloride, MTF: Metformin, VIT-E: Vitamin E.In contrast, both the metformin and vitamin E groups demonstrated bene ﬁcial eﬀects on liver enzyme levels at 15 and 30 days.
These treatments led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in serum levels of ALT ( p < 0.05), AST ( p < 0.05), and ALP ( p < 0.05), indicating a potential improvement in liver function and reduced liv er damage. Furthermore, these groups ex- hibited a notable increase in th e serum level of hexokinase ( p < 0.01), suggesting enhanced glucose metabolism in the liver.Remarkably, the combination grou p demonstrated the most signi ﬁcant eﬀects at 15 and 30 days of treatment duration.Compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone treatment groups, the combination therapy sh owed more pronounced reductions in se- rum levels of ALT ( p < 0.001), AST ( p < 0.001), and ALP ( p < 0.001), indicating a superior protective e ﬀect on liver function.Additionally, the combination group displayed the most substantial increase in serum hexokinase levels ( p < 0.001), indicating enhanced glu- cose metabolism in the liver.

Effect of Treatment on Inﬂammatory Biomarker and Lipid Peroxidation The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on the inﬂammatory biomarker IL-6 (Figure 4A) were measured at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the study period. The experimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.Following the administration of AlCl 3, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the serum level of the inﬂammatory biomarker IL-6 ( p< 0.001), indicating the induction of an inﬂammatory response.However, both the metformin and vitamin E groups showed promising results in reducing the serum level of IL-6 at 15 ( p< 0.05) and 30 days ( p< 0.01) of treatment duration.These ﬁndings suggest that both metformin and vitamin E have anti-inﬂammatory properties and can attenuate the inﬂammatory response induced by AlCl 3exposure.Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 11 of 24 Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 25 in serum hexokinase levels ( p < 0.001).
These results indicate that the combination of met- formin and vitamin E has potent hepatoprotective e ﬀects, which may be crucial in miti- gating liver injury induced by AlCl 3 exposure and maintaining liver function. These findings underscore the potential th erapeutic benefits of combining metformin and vitamin E in protecting liver health an d improving glucose metabolism.However, fur- ther studies are needed to elucidate the mechan isms underlying these effects and to assess the long-term impacts of this combination th erapy on liver function and overall health.3.4.Eﬀect of Treatment on In ﬂammatory Biomarker and Lipid Peroxidation The eﬀects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on the in ﬂamma- tory biomarker IL-6 (Figure 4A) were measured at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the study period.The expe rimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3 at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.
Following the administration of AlCl 3, there was a signi ﬁcant increase in the serum level of the in ﬂammatory biomarker IL-6 ( p < 0.001), indicating the induction of an in ﬂammatory response. However, both the metformin and vitamin E groups showed promising results in reducing the serum level of IL-6 at 15 ( p < 0.05) and 30 days ( p < 0.01) of treatment duration.These ﬁndings suggest that both metformin and vitamin E have anti-in ﬂammatory properties and can a ttenuate the in ﬂammatory response induced by AlCl 3 exposure.Remarkably, the combination group exhibited the most signi ﬁcant eﬀects at 15 and 30 days of treatment duration.Compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone treat- ment groups, the combination therapy showed a more pronounced decline in the serum level of IL-6 ( p < 0.001), indicating a synergistic anti-in ﬂammatory e ﬀect.
A t 45 days of study duration, the metformin grou p continued to show a greater e ﬀect in decreasing the serum level of IL-6 ( p < 0.01) compared to the vitamin E group. However, the combination group demonstrated the most potent anti-in ﬂammatory e ﬀect, displaying a remarkable decrease in the serum level of IL-6 ( p < 0.001) at the 45-day study period.These results suggest that the combination of metformin and vita min E exerts a su- perior anti-in ﬂammatory e ﬀect compared to each treatment alone.The signi ﬁcant reduc- tion in IL-6 levels indicates that this combination therapy may have a protective role in suppressing in ﬂammation, which is essential in managing various in ﬂammatory diseases and conditions.These ﬁndings hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting in ﬂammation-associated conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and other in ﬂammatory diseases.Figure 4.

Compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone treatment groups, the combination therapy showed a more pronounced decline in the serum level of IL-6 ( p< 0.001), indicating a synergistic anti-inﬂammatory effect. At 45 days of study duration, the metformin group continued to show a greater effect in decreasing the serum level of IL-6 ( p< 0.01) compared to the vitamin E group.However, the combination group demonstrated the most potent anti-inﬂammatory effect, displaying a remarkable decrease in the serum level of IL-6 ( p< 0.001) at the 45-day study period.These results suggest that the combination of metformin and vitamin E exerts a supe- rior anti-inﬂammatory effect compared to each treatment alone.The signiﬁcant reduction in IL-6 levels indicates that this combination therapy may have a protective role in sup- pressing inﬂammation, which is essential in managing various inﬂammatory diseases and conditions.
These ﬁndings hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting inﬂammation-associated conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and other inﬂammatory diseases. The effect of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on the serum level of MDA was measured at multiple time points (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) during the treat- ment duration (Figure 4B).The experimental groups were exposed to AlCl 3at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day.After the administration of AlCl 3, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the serum level of MDA ( p< 0.001), indicating the occurrence of lipid peroxidation and ox- idative stress.However, both the metformin and vitamin E groups demonstrated positive effects in reducing the serum level of MDA at 15 ( p< 0.05) and 30 days ( p< 0.01) of the treatment period.
These ﬁndings suggest that both metformin and vitamin E possess potent antioxidant properties and can effectively counteract oxidative stress induced by AlCl 3exposure. Remarkably, the combination group showed the most signiﬁcant effects at 15 and 30 days of treatment duration.Compared to both the metformin and vitamin E alone treatment groups, the combination therapy exhibited a more pronounced decline in the serum level of MDA ( p< 0.001), indicating a synergistic antioxidant effect.At 45 days of study duration, the combination group continued to demonstrate the most potent effect in improving the serum level of MDA ( p< 0.001) compared to the metformin and vitamin E groups.These results suggest that the combination of metformin and vitamin E has a sustained and robust antioxidant effect, effectively reducing oxidative stress even after Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 12 of 24 prolonged treatment.
These ﬁndings indicate that the combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E holds great promise in alleviating oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, which are key factors in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cardiovas- cular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic disorders. The antioxidant properties of metformin and vitamin E offer potential therapeutic beneﬁts in combating lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress-related diseases and promoting overall health and well-being.3.5.Histopathological Analysis The effects of metformin and vitamin E alone and in combination on pancreatic, heart, and brain tissue morphology were observed through H&E staining (Figure 5).Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 25 (A) ( B) ( C) ( D) ( E) Figure 5.Eﬀect of treatment after the exposure of AlCl 3 on pancreas, heart, and brain (cortex and hippocampus) tissue morphology.In pancreas, ( A): Islet of Langerhans appeared normal.

These changes included necrosis and disarrangement of the muscle cell nucleus, indicating cardioto xicity and damage to the cardiac tissue. In contrast, the metformin- and vitamin E- treated groups showed some level of pro- tection against cardiac tissue damage induced by AlCl 3.The heart tissue in these groups Figure 5.Effect of treatment after the exposure of AlCl 3on pancreas, heart, and brain (cortex and hippocampus) tissue morphology.In pancreas, ( A): Islet of Langerhans appeared normal.The acinar cells seemed to be normal in structure.( B): Inﬂammation, cell swelling, and necrosis were seen.(C): The acinar cells appeared normal in structure.Congestion was present at a few places.( D): Mild shrinkage of islets of Langerhans was seen.Necrosis was present in a few sites.( E): Normal morphol- ogy of acinar cells and islet of Langerhans was seen.In heart, ( A): Intercalated disk and muscle cell nucleus appeared normal.

Neurons and glial cells showed normal appearance.3.5.1.Effects of Treatment on Pancreatic Tissue The effect of metformin, vitamin E alone, and the combination of metformin + vita- min E on pancreatic tissue (Figure 5) was carefully assessed after exposure to AlCl 3.The pancreatic tissue in the control group exhibited a normal appearance with intact islets of Langerhans, which are important for insulin production and glucose regulation.However, in the group treated with AlCl 3, distinct morphological changes were observed in the pancreatic tissue.These changes included necrosis and shrinkage of the islets of Langer- hans, indicating pancreatic toxicity and damage to the insulin-secreting cells.In contrast, the metformin- and vitamin E-treated groups showed some level of protection against pancreatic tissue damage induced by AlCl 3.
The pancreatic tissue in these groups exhibited milder necrosis compared to the AlCl 3-exposed group, suggesting the potential protective effects of metformin and vitamin E against pancreatic toxicity. Remarkably, the combination group displayed the most signiﬁcant preservation of pancreatic tissue morphology.In this group, the islets of Langerhans were well-preserved, and signs of necrosis were notably reduced, indicating a strong protective effect of the combination therapy against AlCl 3-induced pancreatic damage.These results suggest that the combination of metformin and vitamin E may have a synergistic effect in protecting the pancreatic tissue from the toxic effects of AlCl 3.The observed improvements in pan- creatic tissue morphology indicate the potential of this combination therapy to mitigate pancreatic toxicity and preserve the function of the islets of Langerhans in the presence of AlCl 3exposure.3.5.1.1.
Effects of Treatment on Heart Tissue The effect of metformin, vitamin E alone, and the combination of metformin + vitamin E on heart morphology (Figure 5) was carefully assessed after exposure to AlCl 3. The heart tissue of the control group exhibited normal histology without any notable abnormalities.However, in the group treated with AlCl 3, distinct morphological changes were observed in the heart tissue.These changes included necrosis and disarrangement of the muscle cell nucleus, indicating cardiotoxicity and damage to the cardiac tissue.In contrast, the metformin- and vitamin E-treated groups showed some level of protection against cardiac tissue damage induced by AlCl 3.The heart tissue in these groups exhibited milder necrosis compared to the AlCl 3-exposed group, suggesting the potential protective effects of metformin and vitamin E against cardiotoxicity.Remarkably, the combination group displayed the most signiﬁcant preservation of heart tissue morphology.
In this group, the muscle cell nuclei were well-preserved, and signs of necrosis were notably reduced, indicating a strong protective effect of the com- bination therapy against AlCl 3-induced cardiac damage. These results suggest that the combination of metformin and vitamin E may have a synergistic effect in protecting the heart tissue from the toxic effects of AlCl 3.The observed improvements in cardiac tissue morphology indicate the potential of this combination therapy to mitigate cardiotoxicity and maintain heart tissue integrity in the presence of AlCl 3exposure.3.5.1.2.Effects of Treatment on Brain Tissue The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and the combination of metformin + vitamin E on brain hippocampus and cortex tissue (Figure 5) were carefully assessed.In the control group, the brain tissue displayed normal histology without any noticeable abnormalities.However, in the group treated with AlCl 3, distinct morphological changes were observed in the brain tissue.
In the hippocampus, there was reduced cellularity, degradation of neurons, and the presence of hemorrhage, indicating neurotoxicity and damage to the hippocampal Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 14 of 24 region. In the cortex, granulovacuolar degeneration and signs of ischemia were observed, further conﬁrming the detrimental effects of AlCl 3on cortical tissue.In contrast, the metformin- and vitamin E-treated groups showed promising results in preserving brain tissue integrity.In the hippocampus, the brain tissue displayed main- tenance of cell thickness and only mild hemorrhage, suggesting the protective effects of metformin and vitamin E against neuronal damage induced by AlCl 3exposure.In the cortex, mild neuronal ischemia was observed in the metformin- and vitamin E-treated groups, indicating a partial protective effect against cortical tissue damage.Interestingly, the combination group exhibited the most notable preservation of brain tissue morphology.
In the hippocampus, the combination treatment maintained the neu- ronal structure and thickness of Purkinje cells, demonstrating a potent protective effect against neurodegeneration and neuronal damage. In the cortex, the combination therapy showed maintenance of glial cells and reduced signs of damage, indicating a pronounced protective effect against cortical tissue injury induced by AlCl 3.These results indicate that the combination of metformin and vitamin E has a synergistic effect in protecting brain tissue, particularly the hippocampus and cortex, against the toxic effects of AlCl 3.The observed improvements in neuronal and glial cell integrity suggest that this combination therapy may hold promise in mitigating neurodegenerative changes and cortical damage induced by AlCl 3exposure.3.5.1.3.
Masson’s Trichrome Staining after Treatment The effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and in combination on brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues (Figure 6) were assessed through Masson’s trichrome staining.

Vacuolation of white ma tter is a characteristic feature of neurotoxicity and can lead to disruptions in neural commu nication and function. However, the groups treated with metformin, vitamin E alone, and the combination of both showed notable morphological improvements in brain tissue .In the metformin-treated group, we ob- served mild vacuolation of white ma tter, indicating that metformin may have a partial protective e ﬀect against AlCl 3-induced neurotoxicity.Similarly, the vitamin E-treated group exhibited vacu olation of white ma tter at a few places within the tissue site, suggest- ing that vitamin E also o ﬀered some level of protection against neurotoxicity induced by AlCl 3.Remarkably, the combination group displayed normal brain morphology after Masson’s trichrome staining.
Th e brain tissue in this group showed no evidence of vacu- olation, indicating that the combination th erapy of metformin an d vitamin E provided robust protection against AlCl 3-induced neurotoxicity. These ﬁndings suggest that the combination therapy may have a synergistic e ﬀect in preserving brain tissue struct ure and mitigating the toxic e ﬀects of AlCl 3 on white ma tter.Figure 6.Effect of treatment on brain, heart, and pancreatic tissues after exposure to AlCl 3through Masson’s trichrome staining: In pancreas, ( A): Islet of Langerhans and acinar cells seemed to be normal in structure.( B): Appearance of ﬁbrotic tissues between acinar cells and around islets of Langerhans was seen after exposure to AlCl 3.(C): Very mild ﬁbrotic tissue around the islet of Langerhans was seen at a few sites of the tissue.( D): Few ﬁbrotic tissues around the islet of Langerhans were present.( E): No ﬁbrotic tissues around the islet of Langerhans were seen.

Vacuolation of white matter is a characteristic feature of neurotoxicity and can lead to disruptions in neural communication and function. However, the groups treated with metformin, vitamin E alone, and the combination of both showed notable morphological improvements in brain tissue.In the metformin-treated group, we observed mild vacuolation of white matter, indicating that metformin may have a partial protective effect against AlCl 3-induced neurotoxicity.Similarly, the vitamin E-treated group exhibited vacuolation of white matter at a few places within the tissue site, suggesting that vitamin E also offered some level of protection against neurotoxicity induced by AlCl 3.Remarkably, the combination group displayed normal brain morphology after Masson’s trichrome staining.The brain tissue in this group showed no evidence of vacuolation, indicating that the combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E provided robust protection against AlCl 3-induced neurotoxicity.
These ﬁndings suggest that the combination therapy may have a synergistic effect in preserving brain tissue structure and mitigating the toxic effects of AlCl 3on white matter. The observed improvements in brain morphology in the combination group may be attributed to the combined actions of metformin and vitamin E, which may work together to counteract the neurotoxic effects of AlCl 3.Overall, the results from Masson’s trichrome staining indicate the potential of metformin and vitamin E combination therapy as a promising strategy to protect against neurotoxicity induced by AlCl 3exposure.However, further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect and to evaluate the functional implications of these morphological improvements in brain tissue.
Analysis of Fibrosis in Heart Tissue after Treatment In this study, we investigated the effects of metformin, vitamin E, and the combination of both in a rat model after inducing neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance through the administration of AlCl 3(Figure 6). The control group displayed normal mor- phological features in heart tissue, indicating that there were no observable abnormalities in the absence of AlCl 3exposure.In contrast, the group treated with AlCl 3(50 mg/kg/day) showed the development of ﬁbrotic tissues around the blood vessels in heart tissue.Fibrotic tissues can impair the proper functioning of the heart and contribute to cardiovascular dysfunction.However, the groups treated with metformin and vitamin E alone exhibited mild collagen deposition and ﬁbrotic tissue in the heart.These ﬁndings suggest that metformin and vitamin E may have a limited protective effect against AlCl 3-induced ﬁbrosis in the heart.
Remarkably, the combination group showed maintenance of cells and no ﬁbrotic tissue around the blood vessels in the heart. This result indicates that the combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E effectively prevented the development of ﬁbrosis and preserved the struc- tural integrity of heart tissue in the presence of AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance.The absence of ﬁbrotic tissue in the combination group sug- gests a potential synergistic effect between metformin and vitamin E in protecting against cardiac ﬁbrosis induced by AlCl 3.The combination therapy may have targeted multiple Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 16 of 24 pathways involved in ﬁbrosis and inﬂammation, leading to the observed improvement in heart tissue morphology.
These ﬁndings highlight the potential of the combination therapy as a promising approach to mitigating the adverse effects of AlCl 3on heart tissue and suggest its potential utility in preventing or ameliorating cardiometabolic disturbances associated with neuroinﬂammation. Analysis of Fibrosis in Pancreatic Tissue after Treatment In this study, we examined the effects of metformin, vitamin E, and their combination on pancreatic tissue after inducing neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance with AlCl 3(Figure 6).In the control group, the pancreatic tissue displayed a normal appearance with well-deﬁned and intact islets of Langerhans, indicating no abnormalities in the absence of AlCl 3exposure.In contrast, the group treated with AlCl 3showed the presence of ﬁbrotic tissues between acinar cells and around the islets of Langerhans.
The development of ﬁbrosis in the pancreas can impair the proper functioning of the organ and disrupt insulin production, leading to potential disturbances in glucose metabolism. The groups treated with metformin and vitamin E alone exhibited very mild ﬁbrotic tissues around the islets of Langerhans.This ﬁnding suggests that both metformin and vitamin E might have a limited protective effect against AlCl 3-induced ﬁbrosis in the pancreas.Intriguingly, the combination group showed no ﬁbrotic tissues around the islets of Langerhans, indicating a signiﬁcant attenuation of ﬁbrotic changes in the pancreatic tissue.This result suggests that the combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E effectively prevented the development of ﬁbrosis and maintained the structural integrity of the islets of Langerhans in the presence of AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance.
The absence of ﬁbrotic tissues in the combination group indicates a potential synergistic effect between metformin and vitamin E in protecting against pancreatic ﬁbrosis induced by AlCl 3. The combination therapy may have targeted multiple pathways involved in ﬁbrosis and inﬂammation, leading to the observed improvement in pancreatic tissue morphology.These ﬁndings underscore the potential of the combination therapy as a promising approach to mitigating the adverse effects of AlCl 3on pancreatic tissue and suggest its potential utility in preventing or ameliorating pancreatic ﬁbrosis associated with neuroinﬂammation.3.6.Analysis of ECG Pattern In this study, we examined the effects of metformin, vitamin E, and their combi- nation on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters after inducing neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance with AlCl 3(Figure 7).
In the control group, different intervals, such as QT, PR, and RR intervals, as well as the QRS complex and ST segment, exhibited a normal pattern, indicating a well-functioning cardiovascular system in the absence of AlCl 3 exposure. However, the group treated with AlCl 3(50 mg/kg/day) showed an abnormality in the ECG, speciﬁcally an inverted QRS complex.The presence of an inverted QRS com- plex is indicative of impaired ventricular depolarization, which can lead to disturbances in cardiac function and electrical conduction.Signiﬁcant improvement in ECG ﬁndings was observed after treatment with met- formin and vitamin E alone.The ECG parameters in these groups showed amelioration, indicating a positive effect on cardiac function and electrical activity.The normalization of the ECG pattern in these groups suggests that both metformin and vitamin E may have beneﬁcial effects on the cardiac system, potentially mitigating the adverse effects induced by AlCl 3.
Interestingly, the combination group treated with metformin and vitamin E showed a completely normal ECG pattern. This ﬁnding indicates that the combination therapy effectively restored the ECG parameters to their baseline levels, resembling the ECG pattern observed in the control group.This normalization of ECG parameters in the combination group suggests a potential synergistic effect between metformin and vitamin E in protecting the cardiovascular system from the detrimental effects of AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance.The normal ECG pattern in the com- Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 17 of 24 bination group further supports the idea that the combination therapy may have targeted multiple pathways involved in cardiac dysfunction and inﬂammation, resulting in the observed improvement in ECG ﬁndings.
These ﬁndings highlight the potential of the combination therapy as a promising approach to preserving cardiac health and preventing the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with AlCl 3exposure. However, further research is needed to elucidate the speciﬁc mechanisms underlying the observed cardioprotective effects and to assess the long-term safety and efﬁcacy of the combination therapy in the context of cardiovascular diseases and related comorbidities.Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 25 involved in ﬁbrosis and in ﬂammation, leading to the observed improvement in pancreatic tissue morphology.These ﬁndings underscore the potential of the combination therapy as a promising approach to mitigating the adverse e ﬀects of AlCl 3 on pancreatic tissue and suggest its potential utility in preventing or ameliorating pancreatic ﬁbrosis associated with neuroin ﬂammation.3.6.

However, in the group treated with AlCl 3, we observed the formation of amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles in the brain tissue. These pathological features are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.In contrast, the metformin-treated group showed a signiﬁcant improvement and decline in the number of neuroﬁbrillary tangles.The presence of fewer neuroﬁbrillary tangles in this group suggests a potential therapeutic effect of metformin in reducing the accumulation of these harmful protein aggregates in the brain.Similarly, the vitamin E-treated group exhibited some level Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 18 of 24 of improvement, with amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles observed at only a few sites in the brain tissue.This indicates that vitamin E may have a partial protective effect against the development of neurodegenerative changes induced by AlCl 3.
Biomedicines 2023 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 25 the ECG pa ttern in these groups suggests that both metformin and vitamin E may have beneﬁcial eﬀects on the cardiac system, potentially mitigating the adverse e ﬀects induced by AlCl 3.

The normal ECG pa ttern in the combination group further supports the idea that the combination therapy may have tar- geted multiple pathways involved in cardiac dysfunction and in ﬂammation, resulting in the observed improvement in ECG ﬁndings. These ﬁndings highlight the potential of the combination therapy as a promising ap- proach to preserving cardiac health and preventing the adverse cardiovascular e ﬀects as- sociated with AlCl 3 exposure.However, further research is needed to elucidate the speci ﬁc mechanisms underlying the observed cardioprotective e ﬀects and to assess the long-term safety and e ﬃcacy of the combination therapy in th e context of cardiovascular diseases and related comorbidities.3.7.Immunohistochemi stry of Brain Tissue The eﬀects of metformin, vitamin E alone, an d in combination were observed after exposure to AlCl 3 (50 mg/kg/day) through IHC (Figure 8).
The brain tissue in the control group exhibited normal histology without an y evidence of abnormal protein accumula- tion. However, in the group treated with AlCl 3, we observed the formation of amyloid plaques and neuro ﬁbrillary tangles in the brain tissue.These pathological features are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.In contrast, the metformin-treated group showed a signi ﬁcant improvement and decline in the number of neuro ﬁbrillary tangles.The presence of fewer neuro ﬁbrillary tangles in this group sug- gests a potential therapeutic e ﬀect of metformin in reducing the accumulation of these harmful protein aggregates in the brain.Simi larly, the vitamin E-treated group exhibited some level of improvement, with amyloid plaques and neuro ﬁbrillary tangles observed at only a few sites in the brain tissue.
This indicates that vitamin E may have a partial pro- tective eﬀect against the development of neurodegenerative changes induced by AlCl 3. Figure 8.Eﬀect of treatment after exposure to AlCl 3 (50 mg/kg/day) on brain tissue through IHC: In control group, brain section show ed normal appearance.In ALCl 3-treated group, amyloid plaques and neuro ﬁbrillary tangles were seen after exposure to AlCl 3.In MTF-treated group, neuro ﬁbrillary tangles were observed at a few sites after treatm ent with metformin.In VIT-E-treated group, amy- loid plaques and neuro ﬁbrillary tangles were seen at a few pl aces.In MTF + VIT-E-treated group, normal neuronal structure was seen.Remarkably, the combination group displayed a remarkable preservation of brain tissue histology.The brain tissue in this grou p showed a normal histological appearance with no evidence of amyloid plaques or neuro ﬁbrillary tangles.
This suggests that the combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E may have a synergistic e ﬀect in mitigat- ing the formation of pathologic al protein aggregates in the brain. These results indicate Figure 8.Effect of treatment after exposure to AlCl 3(50 mg/kg/day) on brain tissue through IHC: In control group, brain section showed normal appearance.In ALCl 3-treated group, amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles were seen after exposure to AlCl 3.In MTF-treated group, neuroﬁbrillary tangles were observed at a few sites after treatment with metformin.In VIT-E-treated group, amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles were seen at a few places.In MTF + VIT-E-treated group, normal neuronal structure was seen.Remarkably, the combination group displayed a remarkable preservation of brain tissue histology.The brain tissue in this group showed a normal histological appearance with no evidence of amyloid plaques or neuroﬁbrillary tangles.
This suggests that the combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E may have a synergistic effect in mitigating the formation of pathological protein aggregates in the brain. These results indicate the potential of the combination therapy to prevent or ameliorate neurodegenerative changes associated with aluminium exposure.However, further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these observed effects and to explore the long-term impact of this treatment on cognitive function and neuroprotective effects.The results from the immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrate the potential of metformin and vitamin E combination therapy in preserving brain tissue histology and mitigating the development of neurodegenerative changes induced by AlCl 3exposure.These ﬁndings may have signif- icant implications for the development of therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease.4.
Discussion In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbance in rat models induced by daily exposure to AlCl 3(50 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal) for consecutive 45 days. Aluminium is a well-known neurotoxicant that has been reported to accelerate oxidative damage, cause cell depletion in the hippocampus, and induce learning deﬁcits.The current study focused on assessing the neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects of metformin and vitamin E in this rat model.The administration of AlCl 3resulted in the generation of ROS, leading to organ damage.Oxidative stress played a role in inhibiting the clearance of amyloid- β, which may contribute to its accumulation/aggregation, ultimately leading to the development of AD [22,23].
Metformin, a frequently recommended oral antidiabetic drug, has been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance without affecting low blood glucose levels. It also exhibits antioxidant and neuroprotective effects and promotes neurogenesis through the stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase, modulating memory formation.On the other hand, vitamin E has been shown to possess anti-inﬂammatory, neuroprotective, and hypocholesterolemic actions [ 24].A study has discovered that metformin reduces blood glucose levels through the downregulation of hepatic glucose production, a process also referred to as gluconeogenesis.It also decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose and enhances insulin sensitivity by improving peripheral glucose utilization and uptake [ 25].Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 19 of 24 In a recent study, it was observed that the intake of vitamin E plays a signiﬁcant role in improving HbA1c and IR in a population with cardiometabolic disturbances.
Vitamin E has led to decreased blood glucose levels in patients with cardiometabolic diseases [26]. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the effects of metformin, vitamin E alone, and their combination on glycemic proﬁles.After treatment with metformin and vitamin E, there was a decrease in serum glucose levels and an increase in insulin levels at 30 and 45 days of the treatment period.The combination group showed a signiﬁcant increase in insulin and a decline in glucose levels compared to other treated and control groups at 45 days of the study period (Figure 1).Metformin is known to suppress hepatic glucose production, increase peripheral glucose uptake, and enhance intestinal glucose usage [ 27].Vitamin E supplementation has been shown to enhance insulin activity and decrease glucose levels due to its antioxidative effects [28].
Regarding lipid proﬁles, the combination group showed a signiﬁcant decline in serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL, along with a signiﬁcant increase in HDL levels at 45 days of the treatment period (Figure 2). Metformin has been reported to have positive effects on lipid proﬁles, reducing serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL while increasing HDL levels [ 29].A study unveiled that metformin counters IR by preventing weight gain, reducing hyperinsulinemia, and maintaining the lipid proﬁle.It has been discovered that metformin can also enhance the lipid proﬁle owing to its glucose-lowering functions.Additionally, it exhibits cardiovascular protective effects [30].Vitamin E, as a lipid-soluble chain-breaking antioxidant, exhibits anti-atherogenic and anti-inﬂammatory activities [ 31].
Observational epidemiological studies have suggested that individuals consuming high amounts of vitamin E through diet or supplements have decreased rates of cardiovascular disease [ 32]. Vitamin E is a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant and has been identiﬁed as a crucial component in breaking the oxidation chain reaction within membranes.It plays a signiﬁcant role in safeguarding polyunsaturated fatty acids in LDL from lipid peroxidation [33].Exposure to AlCl 3signiﬁcantly increased the serum levels of liver function enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP), indicating liver damage (Figure 3).The combination therapy group showed a decline in the serum levels of these enzymes and an increase in hexokinase at 45 days of the treatment period.Metformin therapy has been shown to reduce liver transam- inases and improve liver function by reducing inﬂammation and liver ﬁbrosis [ 34].
Vitamin E also plays a crucial role in maintaining liver health, as evidenced by decreased ALT levels and improved liver function in cases of liver diseases after vitamin E supplementation [ 31]. Inﬂammatory biomarkers were also assessed, and the combination group showed a more signiﬁcant decline in serum levels of these biomarkers compared to metformin and vitamin E alone treatment groups (Figure 4A).Metformin has been reported to reduce the inﬂammatory response by restoring autophagy ﬂux in endothelial cells and decreasing saturated fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation [ 35].Elevated levels of inﬂammatory biomarkers in individuals with DM may increase the risk of macrovascular and microvas- cular complications.Anti-inﬂammatory therapy may prevent future complications and improve the quality of life for patients [36].MDA is a biomarker of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.
Increased lipid peroxi- dation leads to ROS formation, which can lead to neuroinﬂammation, myocarditis, and insulin resistance [ 37]. A study has discovered that a substantial number of inﬂammatory mediators are released during neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disturbances.This activation of inﬂammatory pathways occurs in neurons, glial cells, and other bodily cells, ultimately inﬂuencing neuronal and immune excitability by modulating receptor activity and thereby contributing to neuroinﬂammation.Vitamin E exposure, on the other hand, reduces the risk of these diseases by functioning as an inhibitor of neuroinﬂammatory reactions and glial cell reactivity [ 38].The combination group showed a more signiﬁcant decline in serum levels of MDA at 45 days of the treatment period compared to other treated and control groups (Figure 4B).
Vitamin E possesses antioxidant properties and has Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 20 of 24 been reported to reduce oxidative stress, extracellular matrix deposition, and acinar cell atrophy [32]. The combination therapy of metformin and vitamin E showed signiﬁcant improve- ments in brain and pancreatic tissue morphology compared to the effects of metformin and vitamin E alone [ 39].Metformin has been shown to play a central role in inhibit- ing the aggregation of amyloid- βthrough the activation of AMPK [ 40].Vitamin E has been shown to inhibit the production of ROS, improve the clearance of amyloid proteins, and prevent amyloid- βaggregation, which can ultimately help maintain neurological functions [ 41].Regarding heart tissue, AlCl 3exposure caused myocardial damage and ﬁbrotic tissue formation around blood vessels.However, the combination group showed no ﬁbrotic tissue development (Figure 5).
Previous studies have reported that vitamin E may be crucial in preventing cardiac ﬁbrosis due to its anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant properties. Metformin has been shown to improve endothelium-dependent microvascular response, decrease ﬁbrotic tissue development, and ameliorate the pro-inﬂammatory state in atherosclerosis patients [42].In a study by Barzegar-Amini et al.(2019), it was reported that recipients of vitamin E had a 4% lower risk of cardiac diseases compared to non-recipients [ 43], highlighting the protective role of vitamin E on the cardiovascular system (Figure 5).The neurotoxicity induced by AlCl 3exposure in rats led to cognitive dysfunction and learning and memory impairment, suggesting the development of neurological disorders.However, treatment with metformin and vitamin E showed promising effects in attenuating the formation of neuroﬁbrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, which are characteristic features of neurode- generative diseases.
The combination group demonstrated a normal neuronal structure, indicating the potential neuroprotective effects of the combination therapy. Metformin has been shown to stimulate neurogenesis and angiogenesis while also attenuating neuroin- ﬂammation and brain atrophy, leading to functional recovery in rat models [ 44].In this study, IHC was performed to determine the effect of metformin, vitamin E, and combination effects on AlCl 3-induced neurotoxicity on brain tissue.Formation of neuroﬁbrillary tangles and amyloid plaques was seen in the AlCl 3(50 mg/kg/day)-treated group.Neuroﬁbrillary tangles and amyloid plaques were seen at a few places after treatment with metformin and vitamin E, respectively, whereas the combination group showed normal neuronal structure (Figure 8).Metformin has various properties that may be advantageous for the brain.
It has been reported to stimulate neurogenesis and angiogenesis and has also been reported to attenuate neuroinﬂammation, decrease brain atrophy, and develop/progress functional recovery in rat models [ 45]. Similarly, vitamin E’s neuroprotective role has been associated with hippocampal synaptic activity, neurogenesis, and cell-signaling pathways, suggesting its potential in preventing neurodegenerative diseases by reducing oxidative stress and neuronal death [46].Metformin’s role in activating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and promot- ing hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked to the recovery of cognitive dysfunction [ 47].Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have become signiﬁcant public health concerns, with millions of individuals affected worldwide.
Cognitive decline can have a measurable impact on an individual’s thinking and memory abilities, and vitamin supplementation has been suggested as a strategy to delay the development of cognitive decline in individuals with AD. Among vitamins, vitamin E has shown promise in reducing cognitive decline, act- ing as a scavenger of free radicals and regulating the synthesis of brain prostaglandin and nucleic acid.Some studies have predicted that vitamin E intake may slow down the progres- sion of AD/dementia in elderly individuals [ 48,49].The current study showed a signiﬁcant improvement in vacuolation after continuous administration of 50 mg/kg/day AlCl 3, with recovery observed in the combination therapy group (Figure 6).The normal neuronal structure seen in the metformin + vitamin E group indicates potential beneﬁts in protecting against AlCl 3-induced neurotoxicity.The heart’s network of collagen plays a crucial role in cardiac muscle contractility and provides cardiac strength.
AlCl 3toxicities have been asso- ciated with various cardiac conditions, including myocarditis, DM, ﬁbrosis, ischemic stroke, Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 21 of 24 thrombosis, Alzheimer’s disease, pancreatitis, dementia, and necrosis [ 19]. Vitamin E has been identiﬁed as having anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidative properties, making it a poten- tial candidate in preventing cardiac ﬁbrosis and protecting the cardiovascular system [ 19].Metformin has also shown promise in improving endothelium-dependent microvascular response, decreasing ﬁbrotic tissue development, ameliorating the pro-inﬂammatory state in atherosclerosis patients, and reducing myocardial ischemia [ 50].In the current study, Masson’s trichrome staining of the rat heart revealed ﬁbrotic tissue development around blood vessels after three weeks of continuous AlCl 3administration, while the combination group showed no ﬁbrotic tissue development (Figure 6).
Similarly, vitamin E has been reported to prevent or alleviate the adverse effects of organic compounds on pancreatic ﬁ- brosis and collagen deposition [ 51]. In the present study, high ﬁbrotic tissues were observed between acinar cells and around the islets of Langerhans after 45 days of continuous AlCl 3 administration.However, no ﬁbrotic tissues were observed in the combination therapy group (Figure 6), indicating the potential protective effect of metformin + vitamin E on pan- creatic tissue.Furthermore, long-term exposure to AlCl 3has been associated with cardiac rhythm disturbances, including hypotension, chest discomfort, CNS depression, tachycar- dia/bradycardia, ventricular and atrial dysrhythmias, shortness of breath, coma, and even death [ 51,52].Combination therapy was effective in attenuating AlCl 3-induced alterations in the ECG pattern compared to metformin and vitamin E alone (Figure 7).
These ﬁndings suggest the potential of the combination therapy to protect against AlCl 3-induced cardiac rhythm disturbances. Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs, such as heart failure, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.The production of ROS is associated with cardiac arrhythmias.ROS and oxidative stress play roles in the development of ventricular ﬁbrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT).On the other hand, vitamin E has shown a signiﬁcant antioxidant role in the treatment of arrhythmias related to QT interval.It has the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with ischemic heart disease and/or myocardial ischemia–reperfusion syndrome [ 53].Research has reported that metformin has cardioprotective effects, including reducing myocardial infarct size, exerting positive effects on cardiac remodeling, preserving myocardium, and enhancing left ventricular functional activity [54,55].5.
Conclusions The objective of this study was to illuminate the potential neuroprotective and car- diometabolic advantages of metformin and vitamin E in the context of AlCl 3-induced neuroinﬂammation and cardiometabolic disturbances. Through the assessment of diverse physiological parameters, lipid proﬁles, inﬂammatory markers, and tissue morphology, this research aimed to offer valuable insights into the protective effects of these interventions against the deleterious effects of AlCl 3on the brain, heart, and pancreas.The administration of AlCl 3resulted in signiﬁcant alterations in glycemic proﬁles, lipid proﬁles, liver function enzymes, inﬂammatory biomarkers, and oxidative stress, indicating the development of cardiometabolic disturbance and neuroinﬂammation.However, treatment with metformin and vitamin E alone and in combination showed promising effects in mitigating these adverse effects.
These ﬁndings suggest that combination therapy may offer enhanced glycemic control in cardiometabolic disorders. In terms of lipid proﬁles, the combination therapy showed the most signiﬁcant improvement, with declines in serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL and an increase in HDL levels at 45 days of treatment.The evaluation of brain tissue morphology revealed that the combination therapy preserved neuronal structure.Similarly, the combination therapy showed positive effects on cardiac tissue morphology, with no ﬁbrotic tissues observed around blood vessels.In summary, this study provides compelling evidence supporting the neuro- and cardioprotective effects of metformin and vitamin E alone, with the combination therapy showing the most signiﬁcant overall im- provements.
The combination of metformin and vitamin E holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating cardiometabolic disturbance and neuroinﬂammation- Biomedicines 2023 ,11, 2453 22 of 24 induced damage, offering a novel approach to the prevention and management of neu- rodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.
