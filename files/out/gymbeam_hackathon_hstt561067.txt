Aimofthestudy Thisstudy explored nurse-midwives’ perspectives onproviding MgSO 4topatients withpre- eclampsia oreclampsia inTanzania. Materials andmethods Adescriptive exploratory qualitative study using in-depth interviews wasconducted to understand nurse-midwives’ perspectives onproviding magnesium sulfate topatients with PE/E.Nineteen nurse-midwives were interviewed from three hospitals intheDaresSalaam region.Weused asemi-structured interview guide inKiswahili language tocollect data.All interviews were digitally recorded andtranscribed verbatim.Weanalyzed data using induc- tivecontent analysis.Results Thisstudy revealed thatnurse-midwives provide magnesium sulfate tosave thelives of women andtheir unborn children.Nurse-midwives reasoned thatconfidence intheir skill enhances provision ofmagnesium sulfate.However, theywere concerned about itseffect ontheprogress oflabour.
Ineffective useofmagnesium sulfate emerged from inadequate training, anunsupportive work environmen t,andunderutilization oftheexisting guidelines.

Data Availabilit yStatement: Allrelevant dataare within themanuscript anditsSupport ing Information files.Conclusion Nurse-midwives have clear drive toprovide magnesium sulfate towomen withpreeclampsia oreclampsia.However, inadequate training, underutilization ofguidelines andunsupportive work environment leadtoineffective useofmagnesium sulfate.Targeted practical training should beemphasized fornurse-midwives mastery ofclinical competencies.Introduction Preeclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) areamong themost common causes ofmaternal death and morbidities.
Preeclampsia alone isresponsible formore than 500,000 fetal and more than 70,000 maternal deaths each year worldwide [1],most ofwhich occur inlower- and middle- income countries (LMIC). Upto34% ofmaternal deaths inTanzania areduetopreeclampsia/ eclampsia [2].These conditions arealso associated with poor fetal and neonatal outcomes, including preterm birth, lowbirth weight, and perinatal death [3,4].Early detection and appropriate treatment ofpreeclampsia cansave lives; however, gaps exist.
Women having preeclampsia with severe hypertension orhypertension with neurological signs orsymptoms aretobegiven anticonvulsants forseizure prophylaxis [1].Evidence sug- gests that magnesium sulfate issuperior todiazepam orphenytoin forprevention ofconvul- sions among women with preeclampsia [5].InTanzania, Magnesium sulfate isamong the essential drugs authorized tobeused atalllevels ofhealth facilities [6].However, administra- tion ofanyparenteral anticonvulsants forwomen with preeclampsia/eclampsia islow (13.35%), with injectable diazepam (55%) being often available compared tomagnesium sul- fate(40.77%) [7]. The majority ofnurse-midwives (90%) inTanzania recognize magnesium sulfate asarec- ommended drug forseizure prophylaxis during pregnancy.
However only 38.4% ofthem know itsdosage and correct assessment oftoxicity after administration [8].Tothebest ofour review, there islimited literature onthenurse-midwives’ perspectives onproviding magne- sium sulfate topatients with preeclampsia/eclampsia. With theknowledge that nurse-mid- wives contribute tomost ofhealth workforce inTanzania, understanding their views on providing magnesium sulfate iscritical.Therefore, thisstudy aimed toexplore nurse-mid- wives’ perspectives ontheprovision ofmagnesium sulfate towomen with pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia inTanzania.Materials andmethods Study design Aqualitative descriptive exploratory design wasemployed tounderstand theperspectives of nurse-midwives onadministering magnesium sulfate topatients with preeclampsia and eclampsia.
This design waschosen foritsability tofacilitate anin-depth exploration ofcrucial healthcare questions, yielding insights with direct implications and significant impact onthe specific healthcare setting [9].This method wasappropriate forexploring participants’ opin- ions, beliefs, and professional judgments shaped bytheir personal experiences and clinical practice regarding theprovision ofmagnesium sulfate topatients with preeclampsia and eclampsia inselected health facilities inDar essalaam, Tanzania.

This region islocated ontheeastern coast oftheIndian Ocean ofTanzania. The region hasanarea of1393 square kilometers and com- prises fivemunicipals; Ilala, Kigamboni, Kinondoni, Ubungo and Temeke.The study wasconducted intwopublic regional referral hospitals and oneprivate hospital located inIlala and Temeke municipals.These municipals aredensely populated with hetero- geneous communities.Each regional referral hospital hasnurse-midwives between 199and 305, thematernity units have around 23qualified nurse-midwives working inobstetrics and gynecology wards, antenatal and post-natal wards [10].The selected hospitals provide compre- hensive obstetric and neonatal emergency services and serve asreferral centers forthelower- level health facilities.Also, these hospitals have authorized nurse-midwives tooffer compre- hensive obstetric emergency services, including theadministration ofessential medicines like magnesium sulfate.
Participants and recruitment Purposive sampling wasused torecruit registered nurse-midwives working inthematernity unit after obtaining permission from administrative personnel. Werecruited participants with different years ofworking experience togetinformation from multiple perspectives.Those recruited hadadiploma innursing and midwifery orahigher level ofeducation, provided direct care, and hadexperience giving magnesium sulfate toapatient with PEorE.The researchers obtained alistofregistered nurse-midwives working atthematernity unit from therespective nurse- midwife in-charges.Wethen approached each informant individually, informed them ofthestudy’s purpose and setaninterview appointment.Informants away from workplace were contacted through mobile phone toarrange anappointment foraninter- view.Every nurse-midwife who wascontacted consented inwriting totake part.
Data collection tools This study employed asemi-structured interview guide consisting ofopen-ended questions, allowing participants tofreely express their perspectives onadministering magnesium sulfate topatients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. The researchers developed theinterview guide based oninsights from athorough literature review toensure thequestions effectively addressed theresearch objectives.The primary research questions were asfollows: 1.What arenurse-midwives’ perceived competencies inproviding magnesium sulfate to patients with PE/E?2.How health facility factors influence thenurse-midwives intheprovision ofmagnesium sulfate forwomen with PE/E Questions included probes toensure relevance oftheinformation obtained from partici- pants.The interview guide was initially developed inEnglish and later translated into Kis- wahili, thenative language spoken bymost participants, toensure they clearly understood thequestions.
Toensure clarity and relevance, theinterview guide was first piloted atone health facility before conducting thesubsequent interviews. Moreover, sociodemographic information was collected from participants using abackground information form, which included details such asage, sex, educational background, academic rank, and work experience.PLOS ONEPerspective sofproviding magnes iumsulfate topatients withpreeclam psiaandeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 82August 7,2024 3/15 Data collection procedures In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted inthree hospitals from 24thApril to30th June 2022.Forconvenience, thedata collection sites were labeled asC1,C2and C3.The sched- ulefordata collection waspredetermined byappointment setwith ateach ofthedesignated centers.The interviews were conducted attheinformants’ usual workplaces inaquiet room to ensure privacy, and theconversations were audio-recorded.
Before theinterview, allpartici- pants completed abackground information form and provided written consent forboth par- ticipating inand recording theinterview. Only theresearcher and theinformant were present intheroom during interview.The interviews were conducted byVZC, amale master’s student inMidwifery and Women’s Health.Hehadparticipated intraining onqualitative research methods and hasexperience inqualitative data collection and analysis.Allinterviews were conducted inKiswahili because both theinterviewer and theinformants were native speakers.Probes were used inbetween main interview questions toelicit detailed information and guarantee that participants’ answers were clear.Interviews went onuntil information saturation wasreached, atwhich point participants recruitment wasconcluded [11].The interviews lasted between 30and 60minutes.Data analysis Qualitative content analysis ofthisstudy wasguided byGraneheim and Lundman [12], to understand thetranscripts.
Allinterviews were transcribed verbatim. VZC and anIntern Nurse transcribed theaudios and allauthors were involved indata analysis.The transcripts were read repeatedly tosearch forthemeaning and deeper understanding.The condensed meaning units were formed and coded.Coding wasdone manually byplacing labels alongside themargins ofthetranscripts.VZC developed initial codes which were then discussed and reviewed byAFM (BScN, MSc, PhD), SEM (BScN, MSc, PhD), and EAMT (BScN, M.Phil, PhD).Allagreed codes were exported toMicrosoft excel and sorted into subcategories based ontheir similarities, and thelatter were grouped into categories.Allcategories were con- structed inKiswahili toavoid losing theoriginal meaning.The categories were then translated from Kiswahili toEnglish forreporting.Ethical considerations The study wasconducted inaccordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Ethical approval wasgranted bytheSenate Research and Publication Committee, theinstitutional review board oftheDirectorate ofResearch and Publications atMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (Ref. No.MUHAS-REC-03-202 2-1038).Permission tocollect data wasobtained from thehealth facility authorities.Written informed consent wasobtained from each participant prior tothecommencement ofinterviews.The signed consent form outlined participants’ rights toparticipate inand withdraw from thestudy, itsrisks and benefits, and theaudio recording oftheinterview.Throughout theinvestigation, theresearcher protected confidentiality and treated theinformants’ identities inananonymous manner.Results Nineteen participants were included inthestudy.The participants’ ageranged from 26to57 years old.The majority (89.5%) oftheparticipants were females and most (94.7%) ofthem had adiploma education level.
More than half (52.6%) oftheparticipants hadmore than fiveyears ofexperience intaking care ofPE/E patients while 26.3% had3–5years ofexperience (Table 1).

Nurse-midwives hadcurrent knowledge onprovision ofmagnesium sulfate, they were willing and confident toprovide magnesium sulfate however gaps arepres- ent.Four subcategories have been described under thiscategory; Indications fortheuseof magnesium sulfate, determining thedosage regimen, monitoring thepatient’s response, and postponing theadministration ofmagnesium sulfate. Indications formagnesium sulfate use.Participants reported correct indications forpro- viding magnesium sulfate.First, they identified theright patients and determined thedosing regimen.Participants used magnesium sulfate toprevent seizures inwomen with severe pre- eclampsia features such ashigh blood pressure, urine protein greater than +2ondeep stick, severe headache, upper abdominal pain, and blurred vision.They also used ittotreat convul- sions inwomen who have eclampsia.Table 2.Emerging categori esand subcategori esonnurse-mid wives’ perspect ives ofmagnesium sulfate provision .

Determination ofdosage regimen.Participants stated that they used twodosage forms namely; loading and maintenance doses.They further explained that theloading dose con- sisted of14gmagnesium sulfate divided into 4grams intravenously and 10grams intramuscularly."Forapatientwhohasjustarrivedfromhomeandwasbroughtinbyrelatives, wewillinitiate theloadingdose,whichis14grams.Weadminister 4gintravenously (IV)and10gintramus- cularly(IM)" (Participant 8).Forintravenous administration, participants commonly used 50% magnesium sulfate diluted to20% byadding 12mLofwater forinjection, while that forintramuscular injec- tion wassupplemented with 1mLof2%lignocaine toreduce pain associated with magne- sium sulfate.

Participants were asked how frequently they monitor patients who received magnesium sul- fateand how they assess thepatellar reflex forsigns oftoxicity.They reported monitoring blood pressure every 30minutes initially, and then every 2hours.However, they encountered difficulties ineliciting thepatellar reflex."I’llprobably checkthebloodpressure everyhalfhourifIseethemotherisinmoredanger.I’ll continue monitoring heruntilthebloodpressure stabilizes, thenmaybeevery2hours.I’llkeep checking herandasking,’Howareyoufeeling?‴ (Participant 5).“Performing thepatellarreflexhereisveryrare.Personally, IonlydoitifIamwithadoctor.I cannotperform thepatellarreflexonmyown” (Participant 16).They also reported thepossibility ofbleeding complications, exposure tooperative delivery, suffocation ofthebaby atbirth, and stillbirth.

Participants explained that they delayed togive magnesium sulfate forthewoman with strong uterine contractions and impending childbirth because they believed itinterfered with thewoman’s ability topush. “WhenIadminister magnesium sulfatetoher,sheobviously becomes drowsy,doesn’tpushat all...soshefeelsthepainbutdoesn’tevencry” (Participant 8).Some participants didnotcontinue with repeat dose ofmagnesium sulfate when thewom- an’s diastolic blood pressure was90mmHg orlow.“IfImeasure thebloodpressure andfinditbelownormal, suchas90or100,Idonotadminis- termagnesium sulfate” (Participant 14).b)Reasons formagnesium sulfate use The intention ofusing magnesium sulfate totreat women with preeclampsia/eclampsia was described under twosubcategories.These are:benefits ofusing magnesium and confidence with own skill togive magnesium sulfate.Benefits ofusing magnesium sulfate.
Participants were willing toprovide magnesium sulfate because they understood itsbenefits and theeffects ofpreeclampsia and eclampsia on themother and herunborn child. Their decision tousemagnesium sulfate wasbased onthe idea that itissafe touse, and saves thelifeofthewoman and theunborn child byreducing blood pressure, preventing theeffects ofconvulsions, and providing fastand lasting relief."It’scompelling tomebecausemagnesium sulfateprovides rapidreliefandmaintains itforan extended periodwithitsmaintenance doses.Thisallowscontinuous monitoring andprotec- tionofthepatientforatleast24hours,unlikeValium, whichwearsoffsooner" (Participant 4).“Injecting themotherwithmagnesium sulfateensuresthatthebabywillbebornalive,benefit- ingboththemotherandthebaby’ssurvival.Thistreatment iscrucialformanaging conditions likepreeclampsia oreclampsia, ensuring asafedeliveryforthemotherandherbaby” (Participant 8).
Moreover, participants pointed that magnesium sulfate hassaved numerous lives ofmoth- ersand their unborn babies. Without timely administration ofthisdrug, many would have faced theriskoflossorlong-term disability.PLOS ONEPerspective sofproviding magnes iumsulfate topatients withpreeclam psiaandeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 82August 7,2024 8/15 “Magnesium sulfatehelpsstoporreduceseizuressoshe[thewomanreceiving magnesium sul- fate]automatically benefitsbecauseifshecontinues toconvulse herbrainwillbedamaged whichisaserioussideeffectlateruntilshehasastrokeordisability” (Participant 1).Confidence with own skill togive magnesium sulfate.Participants expressed confidence with their ability toadminister magnesium sulfate.Their confidence came from theability to cope with difficult cases, adequate preparation ofemergency kitand team members, individual commitment toacquire skills, knowledge ofmagnesium sulfate and working experience.
“Itisbecauseofthatknowledge thatyoualsohavedailyunderstanding, something thatyou practiceeverydayisthemainremedyhere[working inEclampsia ward],soitmeansaccord- ingtothat[knowledge andexperience] Igetconfidence” (Participant 12) “Iamveryconfident becauseIhaveprovided thatserviceseveraltimes,soIhaveexperience in identifying patients whocanbegivenMagnesium sulfate” (Participant 9). "Actually, Iusually don’t have fear when administering magnesium.Iknow mypatient isa serious case, sosaying Ihave nofear" (Participant 16).c)Barriers tomagnesium sulfate provision Albeit theawareness ofbeneficial aspects ofmagnesium sulfate, participants reported limita- tions forproviding magnesium sulfate that were classified into individual and institutional barriers, asdescribed inthefollowing sections.Individual barriers.Even though nurses- midwives provided magnesium sulfate to women with preeclampsia oreclampsia, they also faced individual limitations during thepro- cedure.
They reported infrequent contact with theeclamptic patients, and fear ofside effects as barriers tomagnesium sulfate provision. Participants emphasized that administering magne- sium sulfate necessitated ahigh level ofknowledge and careful attention.“Youhavetobeextremely cautious whenadministering thismedication.It’scrucialtoknow exactlywhatyou’redoingandtocloselymonitor itseffects" (Participant 3).Participants observed that midwives who didnotgive magnesium sulfate were afraid oftak- ingcare ofeclamptic patients.They also reported alack ofconfidence caused byinsufficient hands-on experience and fear ofmaking mistakes with magnesium sulfate administration, as stated below.“Ithinkmanyareafraid,theyhaven’tgiventhedrugforalongtime,theythinkmaybethey willmakeamistake, andsomesaythatwhenwestartloadingdose,becausewedon’thavethe tendency, weforgettogivemagnesium sulfate” (Participant 15).

Some were unsure ofwhat todobecause what they learned inclass differed some- what from actual practice.“TobehonestwhatIlearnedandwhatIcameacrossissomething else!Whatyoulearnincol- legeisnotwhatyoudo,butthereisabalancebetween whatyoustudiedthereandseeing actualpatients” (Participant 7).Institutional barriers.Participants reported barriers totheuseofmagnesium sulfate that coined from thehealthcare facility.Participants expressed inadequate training opportunities and refresher courses toincrease their knowledge and skills inusing ofmagnesium sulfate.
Some reported that they were missing current updates because they attended seminars and workshops long time ago. The lack ofon-the-job training wasmore pronounced among participants.“Isaidmaybethereareotherswhogettraining.Imeanthatinaprivatesectorlikethiswedo notgetonthejobtraining” (Participant 1).“IfIdon’treceivetheABCDsofthesethings,I’llkeepdoingthesamething,evenifI’veheard theremightbeanothersolution thatI’mnotawareof” (Participant 8) Underutilization ofguidelines formagnesium sulfate usewasalso reported byparticipants.Senior participants were notusing anyguidelines because they feltthey hadinternalized the necessary procedures and didnothave togothrough theguidelines.However, juniors hada different experience, most ofthem being tutored orally and never seeing anyguidelines.“IonlysawitonceIdon’tknowitlastedaweekbutwhenIarrived,Ijustaskedmycolleagues toteachmehowtoadminister [Magnesium Sulfate]becauseIforgotwhatIwastaughtin school,theyjusttaughtmeorally” (Participant 13).
Others stressed that theguidelines were difficult tounderstand and took some time toget used to.They suggested that work aids instructions onwhat todowhen providing magnesium sulfate should beclear. “Itrequires apersontosticktothepointuntilheunderstands theguideline ....ittakestimeto understand, Ithinkweneedagoodalternative thatdirectstheperson” (Participant 2).Lack ofequipment, unsupportive infrastructure, and staff shortages limited theprovision of magnesium sulfate.Participants reported lack ofequipment such asmonitors, infusion pumps, working and filled oxygen cylinders, suction machines and patella harmers, which were important when administering magnesium sulfate.PLOS ONEPerspective sofproviding magnes iumsulfate topatients withpreeclam psiaandeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 82August 7,2024 10/15 "Wefaceashortage ofmachines thatcancontinuously monitor oxygensaturation andother vitalsignswhilepatients areusingmagnesium sulfate" (Participant 4).
Administration ofthemagnesium sulfate loading dose requires 20ml syringes butthey were inshort supply. Instead, participants used two10ml syringes."Butwedon’thavethe20ccsyringes, soweusethe10ccsyringesinstead." (Participant 5).The participants were dissatisfied with theinfrastructure ofthewards and feltthenecessity tosetupaspecial ward forwomen with pre-eclampsia oreclampsia inallreferral hospitals to facilitate bemonitoring ofthepatients.“Wekeepeclamptic patients together withotherpatients butoftenwecarefortheminthe labourwardandthenursestaysinthelaborward,insteadthereshouldbeaspecialsection” (Participant 3) Furthermore, even inahospital with aspecial department, ward space and eclampsia beds were insufficient toensure patient safety."Thewardisn’tsufficient; therearetimeswhentwoeclampsia patients havetoshareonebed.Imagine iftheyallfit?Thespaceisverylimited,clearlynotenough." (Participant 13) "Ihaven’tseenasturdybedforsomeone who’shavingconvulsions.
Howmanydowehave here?Haveyouseenone?" (Participant 10) Discussion This study revealed that nurse-midwives have adequate knowledge ofthebenefits ofmagne- sium sulfate and itsindications foruseinwomen with preeclampsia oreclampsia. However, knowledge gaps exist.The Pritchard regimen (intravascular and intramuscular administration ofmagnesium sulfate) wascommonly and correctly used.Confidence inadministering mag- nesium sulfate and thebelief that itcanbesafely used influenced nurse-midwives decision to provide it.Individual and health-related factors limited theprovision ofmagnesium sulfate.Nurse-midwives’ knowledge ofthebenefits ofmagnesium sulfate facilitated itsadministra- tion toappropriate patients.This implies that nurse-midwives canconfidently provide magne- sium sulfate when thebenefits areknown.
This finding provides animportant message for designing on-the-job training fornurse-midwives, focusing onthebenefits ofusing magne- sium sulfate forwomen with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Similarly, aprevious study con- ducted inDodoma showed that nurse-midwives’ knowledge facilitated provision of magnesium sulfate [8].The similarity ofthese results may beduetonature ofthestudied con- texts aswell asthetraining curriculum among study participants.Nurse-midwives identified important indications forproviding magnesium sulfate such as hypertension associated with severe features, proteinuria�.However, they didnotmention PLOS ONEPerspective sofproviding magnes iumsulfate topatients withpreeclam psiaandeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 82August 7,2024 11/15 other signs such asend-organ damage that cannecessitate itsprovision intheabsence of hypertension according tonational and international guidelines [6,13].
The International Society fortheStudy ofHypertension inPregnancy (ISSHP) recommends prioritizing the evaluation ofurinary protein excretion and serum creatinine ifresources arelimited [14]. However, nurse-midwives didnothighlight serum creatinine results assignificant factors for diagnosing ordeciding ontheadministration ofmagnesium sulfate.This finding may be related tolack ofupdates orunawareness ofguidelines amongst nurse-midwives.Authors in Egypt have reported similar findings, noting that amajority ofnurses face challenges with their knowledge ontheearly detection and proper treatment ofpre-eclampsia, highlighting theneed forfurther training and updates inthisarea [15].Inthecurrent study, nurse-midwives often preferred thestandard Pritchard regimen over theZuspan regimen.This preference could beattributed totheperceived practicality ofthe Pritchard regimen, which does notrequire ICU monitoring ortheuseofinfusion pumps.
This regimen’s widespread adoption involved administering magnesium sulfate both intravenously and intramuscularly. Preference forthisregimen could berelated toinadequate skills tomoni- torintravenous infusions ofmagnesium sulfate, poor work environment and unawareness of thealternative regimen (Zuspan).Incontrast, authors inhigh-income countries, such asthe United States, have reported that theresources required tomonitor apatient onmagnesium infusion were adeterrent tousing magnesium sulfate [16].Most clinicians expressed aprefer- ence foranalternative medication.Inthecurrent study, participants administered both load- ingand maintenance doses ofmagnesium sulfate toallpatients with indications foritsuse, demonstrating adherence totheclinical protocol.Incontrast, another study reported inconsis- tencies inproviding these doses, with clinicians varying theadministration based onpatient conditions, sometimes resulting inunderdosing [16, 17].
Aknowledge gapdoes notonly exist inmagnesium sulfate administration, asnoted ina Kenyan study [4].There isoften lack ofknowledge onhow tomonitor magnesium sulfate tox- icity [13]. Inthecurrent study, thepatellar reflex wasmentioned butexplanations onhow to assess thereflex and interpretation oftheresults ofassessment waslacking.Moreover, thefre- quency ofmonitoring signs ofmagnesium sulfate toxicity asmentioned byparticipants was lacking when compared toWHO guidelines [13].This finding hasclinical implications for patient safety and highlights apotential knowledge and skill gapthat should beaddressed through on-the-job training fornurse-midwives.Fear ofadverse consequences caused midwives toeventually postpone orcease giving mag- nesium sulfate.This suggests awareness ofthepotential forcustomer toxicity.Similar results indicating concerns about fetal hazards and mother safety have been documented elsewhere [18, 19].
Thus, itiscorrect tostop theadministration ofmagnesium sulfate inthepresence of signs oftoxicity [6].Inhigh-income countries, healthcare providers often express concerns about thesafety profile ofmagnesium sulfate and believe that analternative agent forprevent- ingeclampsia isnecessary [16]. Ontheother hand, Brazilian obstetricians expressed concerns about potential adverse effects, such ascardiorespiratory arrest, associated with theuseofmag- nesium sulfate, and feltinadequately prepared tomanage such complications [18].The nurse-midwives inthecurrent study delayed theadministration ofmagnesium sulfate because offear that thewomen willbeunable topush during childbirth.This finding hasnot been reported elsewhere.Prolongation oflabor may notbeareason todiscontinue ordelay administration ofmagnesium sulfate inwomen with severe features ofpreeclampsia or eclampsia.The risk ofdeveloping eclampsia continues throughout thebirth process.
This find- ingunderscores theimportance ofnurses’ knowledge about thecourse ofpreeclampsia and eclampsia, aswell asthenecessity forthem tobeequipped with theskills needed tomanage a woman who hasbeen given magnesium sulfate during ornear childbirth. PLOS ONEPerspective sofproviding magnes iumsulfate topatients withpreeclam psiaandeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 82August 7,2024 12/15 This study found that theunderutilization ofmagnesium sulfate wascaused byalack of equipment, apaucity ofmidwives, and theperception that thetreatment required alotof work.The results areconsistent with aseveral studies that demonstrated thedifficulty of administering magnesium sulfate, making observations, and documenting theprocess, in addition totheneed forinsufficient midwives and equipment, such asblood pressure monitors [16, 17,19,20].
The similarity ofthestudy areas’ lowsocioeconomic standing and severely underdeveloped healthcare systems may account fortheconsistency ofthese findings. Also, these studies revealed that nurses-midwives felttheneed tosetupadedicated ward forpre- eclampsia and eclampsia patients, suggesting that separate wards areneeded toimprove qual- ityofcare.Inadequate training wasalso identified asalimiting factor fortheproviding magne- sium sulfate atthehealthcare facility level.Studies from elsewhere have shown similar findings where limited knowledge and little experience instilled fear and limited theuseofmagnesium sulfate [16, 20].The change inclinical guidelines asnew evidence emerge should gohand in hand with thetraining ofnurse-midwives, who areamong thekeyimplementers ofthe guidelines.Study limitations Purposive sampling wasused torecruit participants.Thus, theresults may notrepresent the views ofallmidwives.
The study wasbased onreported perspectives ofproviding magnesium sulfate towomen with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. Participants may have reported theinforma- tion they wanted, butnotwhat they were doing because they were notobserved.The research- ersused probing tominimize thisbias.Inaddition, experiences from private hospitals may nothave been comprehensively captured asonly oneprivate hospital wasinvolved compared totwopublic hospitals with essentially thesame characteristics.This wasduetothelack ofper- mission toconduct thestudy inaprivate hospital during thedata collection.Nevertheless, the presented findings arebased ontheprinciples ofsaturation.Conclusion Our study hasrevealed that nurse-midwives possess knowledge oftheindications and benefits ofmagnesium sulfate, along with confidence intheir skills toadminister it.These factors are essential fortheeffective provision ofmagnesium sulfate.
Wealso found that nurse midwives delay administration ofmagnesium sulfate when thewoman inlabor isnear childbirth. Signif- icant gaps inknowledge and skills areevident inthemonitoring and care provision for patients who have received magnesium sulfate.Moreover, nurse-midwives face various chal- lenges ranging from lack ofonjobtraining focusing onmagnesium sulfate administration and care forpatients with preeclampsia and eclampsia, shortage ofequipment and supplies aswell asunfavorable working conditions.Based onourfindings werecommend that nurse-midwives betrained with focus onmas- tery ofpractical competencies that arecoherent with clinical work tominimize thegap between theoretical knowledge and practice.Monitoring and caring forpatients receiving magnesium sulfate should beafocal point ofon-the-job training fornurse-midwives.
Addi- tionally, itiscrucial todevelop clinical observation protocols that specify thefrequency of patient assessments while onmagnesium sulfate and provide prompts forappropriate actions based onassessment findings. Healthcare facility authorities canutilize ourfindings todesign interventions aimed atenhancing working conditions and mitigating facility-related barriers faced bynurse-midwives when administering magnesium sulfate topatients with preeclampsia and eclampsia.Further research isneeded toestablish theimpact ofpostponing magnesium sulfate administration until thewoman have given birth.PLOS ONEPerspective sofproviding magnes iumsulfate topatients withpreeclam psiaandeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 82August 7,2024 13/15 Supporting information S1Table.Analysis codebook forPE_E acknowledgmen ts.The authors extend their sincere gratitude totheMuhimbili University ofHealth and Allied Sciences forproviding logistic sup- port.
