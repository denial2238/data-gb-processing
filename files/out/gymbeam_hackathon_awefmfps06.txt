Objectives: To study the preva- lence of VDD and its associated clinical outcomes among pa-tients hospitalized for osteoporotic fracture. To exploreinpatient strategies of vitamin D repletion in the immedi-ate post fracture setting.Design, Setting and Patients: An observational study of patients admitted to theMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH) with fractures be-tween January 2016 to October 2023 who were cared by theFLS.Exposures and Intervention: A vitamin D reple- tion regimen consisting of ergocalciferol 50,000 inter-national units (IU) oral daily for a number of daysfollowed by maintenance cholecalciferol of 1000-1500 IUdaily was studied in a subset of patients with VDD.Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of VDD among MGH FLS patients.Ef ﬁcacy of inpatient daily ergocalcif- erol administration to raise serum 25OHD.Results: Of the 2,951 consecutive patients, 724 (24.53%) were vitaminDd eﬁcient as de ﬁned by serum 25OHD level of ≤19ng/ml.
Men (252 of 897, or 28.09%) were more likely than women(472 of 2,054, or 22.98%) to have VDD (p =0.003). VDD was seen 41.79% (117 of 280), 24.41% (332 of 1,360) and 20.98% (275 out 1,311) of patients of ≤59, 60-79, and ≥80 years old, respectively (p <0.00001).Of the 1,303 patients with hip fragility fractures, 327 (25.09%) had VDD.Patients with VDD, despite being younger (78.55 ±11.75 vs.80.28 ±10.47, p =0.018), had longer average length-of-stay (aLOS) than those without VDD did (8.37±7.35 vs.7.23 ±4.78 days, p =0.009).Re-admission and non-union rates up to two years following the index hip fracture were not different between the two groups.Among 32 pa- tients, without known malabsorption or liver cirrhosis, who had 25OHD levels available before and after ergocalcif-erol treatment, each dose of ergocalciferol, on average,raised serum 25OHD by 3.62 ±2.35 (m ±sd) ng/ml.
Daily ergocalciferol administration did not change serum calciumand creatinine levels.Patients with chronic liver disease(CLD), who had higher prevalence of VDD (64 of 156 pa-tients, or 41.04%), showed impairedper-dose-of-ergocalciferol 25OHD response (0.87 ±0.92. n=10) ng/ml.Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly 25% of patients hospitalized for osteoporotic fractures, caredfor by MGH FLS, had VDD.Male sex, younger age, andCLD were associated with a higher prevalence of VDD.VDD was associated with, on average, one extra day of hos-pital stay among patients admitted for hip fracture.Dailyergocalciferol, with each dose of 50,000 IU raising serum25OHD level by 3-4 ng/ml, followed by maintenance doseof cholecalciferol of 1000 to 1500 IU is potentially a practicalway to quickly replete vitamin D among patients with VDDhospitalized for fracture.
