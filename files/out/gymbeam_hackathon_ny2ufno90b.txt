RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Effective dosing of L-carnitine in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis Ruiping Shang*, Zhiqi Sun and Hui Li Abstract Background: L-carnitine supplementation has been associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, ventricular arrhythmia, and angina in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI).However, on account of stricthomeostatic regulation of plasma L-carnitine concentrations, higher doses of L-carnitine supplementation may not provide additional therapeutic benefits.This study aims to evaluate the effects of various oral maintenance dosages of L-carnitine on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidities in the setting of acute MI.
Methods: After a systematic review of several major electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2013, a meta-analysis of five controlled trials (n = 3108) was conducted to determine theeffects of L-carnitine on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidities in the setting of acute MI. Results: The interaction test yielded no significant differences between the effects of the four daily oral maintenance dosages of L-carnitine (i.e., 2 g, 3 g, 4 g, and 6 g) on all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] = 0.77, 95% CI [0.57-1.03], P= 0.08) with a statistically insignificant trend favoring the 3 g dose (RR = 0.48) over the lower 2 g dose (RR = 0.62), which was favored over the higher 4 g and 6 g doses (RR = 0.78, 0.78).
There was no significant differences between the effects of the daily oral maintenance dosages of 2 g and 6 g on heart failure (RR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.25-1.13], P= 0.10), unstable angina (RR = 0.90, 95% CI [0.51-1.58], P= 0.71), or myocardial reinfarction (RR = 0.74, 95% CI [0.30-1.80], P=0 . 5 0 ) .Conclusions: There appears to be no significant marginal benefit in terms of all-cause mortality, heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial reinfarction in the setting of acute MI for oral L-carnitine maintenance doses of greater or lessthan 3 g per day.Keywords: Carnitine, L-carnitine, Dose, Dosage, Dosing, Cardiovascular, Myocardial infarction, MI Background Cardiovasular disease (CVD) is the world's leading cause of death, far outstripping infectious disease mortality frommalaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis [1].
In the U.S., CVD is the leading cause of death, constitutes 17% of healthcare costs, and is estimated to increase in prevalence by ~10%and direct costs by almost three-fold over the next 20 years under current CVD prevention and treatment regimes [2]. However, secondary preventative interventions such asantiplatelet drugs, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting- enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers(ARBs), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to significantly reduce CVD risk [3].There- fore, a greater focus on improving the secondary preven-tion of CVD should ameliorate these dire projections.One promising alternative therapy for the secondary prevention of CVD is L-carnitine, the biologically activestereoisomer of dietary carnitine ( β-hydroxy- γ-N- trimethylaminobutyric aci d) [4].Cardiac muscle cells cannot synthesize L-carnitine de novo and must ac- quire L-carnitine exogenously via the arnitine/organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN 2).
Cardiac mitochondria use the carnitine-acylcarniti ne carrier (CAC) to import fatty acyl moieties for β-oxidation, the primary energy source in heart muscle [4]. Thus, deficiencies in L- carnitine or its transporter CAC have particularly * Correspondence: srp0459@163.com Department of Cardiology, Daqing General Hospital Group, Oilfield GeneralHospital, No.9 Zhongkang Road, Daqing City 163001, Heilong JiangProvince, China © 2014 Shang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly credited.The Creative Commons Public DomainDedication waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) applies to the data made available in this article,unless otherwise stated.Shang et al.
BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2014, 14:88 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/14/88 adverse effects on cardiomyocytes, resulting in cardio- myopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac insufficiency, and heart failure [4]. As exogenous L-carnitine aids in resumption of nor- mal oxidative metabolism and restoration of myocar- dial energy reserves, L-carnitine supplementation hasbeen shown to have favorable effects in CVD patients [4].In chronic heart disease patients, L-carnitine administra- tion over 12 months has been shown to attenuate leftventricular dilatation and prevent ventricular remodel- ing while reducing incidence of chronic heart failure and death.
The protective effects of L-carnitine supple-mentation also extend to acute myocardial infarction (MI); following acute MI, prompt L-carnitine adminis- tration and subsequent oral maintenance therapy has beenshown to attenuate progressive left ventricular dilatation and appears to reduce myocardial injury through im- proving carbohydrate metabolism and reducing thetoxicity of high free fatty acid levels [5,6]. A recent sys- tematic review and meta-analysis of 13 controlled trials by DiNicolantonio et al.found that L-carnitine supple-mentation was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, ventricular arrhythmia, and angina in the setting of acute MI [7].However, the DiNicolantonio's study did not examine the effect of varying L-ca rnitine dosing on all-cause mortality or adverse cardiovasular outcomes.
Followingingestion of a dietary L-carnitine, the rate of L-carnitine excretion increases rapidly because absolute reabsorp- tion –which is based on the number of the OCTN2 transporters in the distal tubules of the kidney –does not change [8]. As L-carnitine levels do not significantly influence OCTN2 expression, r enal filtration maintains a narrow plasma concentration range of 40 –60μmol/l with plasma L-carnitine above this threshold being eliminated via urine [8].Therefore, on account of this strict homeostatic regu- lation of plasma L-carnitine concentrations, high doses of L-carnitine supplementation may not provide add-itional therapeutic benefits.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to determine the effects of various oral maintenance dosages of L-carnitine on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidities in the setting of acute MI.
Methods Ethics statement The Ethics Committee (IRB) of Oilfield General Hospital(Daqing City, Heilong Jiang Province, China) recog- nizes that this systematic review and meta-analysis of de-identified, publicly available data does not consti-tute “human subjects research ”as defined by relevant national regulations, and therefore does not require Ethics Committee review.Search strategy A systematic review of the available literature was per-formed according to the PRI SMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guide- lines for the conduct of systematic reviews of interven- tion studies [9]. Relevant randomized controlled trials(RCTs) were identified from systematic searches of sev- eral major electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2013 with thefollowing search strategy: ( “L-carnitine ”OR “carnitine ”) AND “myocardial infarction ”.
English language and human study restrictions were imposed in all searches.Additional relevant articles were obtained through scanning reference lists of articles identified in the ini- tial searches. Inclusion criteria Studies were selected for inclusion on the basis of thefollowing criteria: compar ative trials of adults (> = 18 years old) receiving oral L-carnitine compared with placebo or control, with outcomes of all-cause mortalityand adverse cardiovascular events including unstable angina, myocardial reinfarction, heart failure, and ven- tricular arrythmia.We excluded studies that did notreport mortality or morbidity outcomes.Study selection and data extraction The titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were independently screened by two reviewers, and irrelevant studies were excluded.Thefull texts were obtained from all articles meeting the inclusion criteria.
Then, articles were scanned and the data from these studies was extracted, including the number ofpatients per arm, L-carnitine dosing (including initial load- ing dosing and daily oral maintenance dosing), acute MI (AMI) index event type, follow-up duration, and outcomes(i.e., all-cause mortality, adverse cardiovascular events including unstable angina, acute MI, heart failure, and ventricular arrythmia). Data extraction was performedby two independent reviewers.Quality assessment Quality assessment was based on the following criteria – concealment of treatment allocation; similarity of both groups at baseline regarding prognostic factors andmedication use; blinding of outcome assessors, care pro- viders, and patients; completeness of follow-up; and intention-to-treat analysis –and quantified using the Jadad score [10].Quality assessment was undertaken by two independent reviewers.
Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration criteria specifically evalu-ating sequence generation of allocation; allocation con- cealment; blinding of participants, staff, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcomeShang et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2014, 14:88 Page 2 of 7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/14/88 reporting; and other sources of bias.Trials with high or unclear risk of bias in the first three criteria were deemed ‘high risk ’.Statistical analysis The meta-analysis of comparable data was performed using Review Manager 5.0.2 (the Nordic Cochrane Centre, the Cochrane Collaboration, 2008).For con- tinuous outcomes, the results were expressed as themean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
The degree of heterogeneity across the results of different studies was quantitatively assessed by the I 2statistic, with I2< 30% indicating low heterogeneity, I2= 30-50% indi- cating moderate heterogeneity, and I2> 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity [11]. In the event of no con-spicuous heterogeneity, a f ixed-effects model was used.If heterogeneity was detected, a random-effects model was used.A P< 0.05 was deemed to be statistically sig- nificant for all analyses.Results Study selection and characteristics The literature search yielded 135 records (Figure 1).Afterscreening titles and abstracts, only nine studies were eli-gible for full-text review, of which five met all inclusion criteria [12-16].Table 1 summarizes the characteristics ofthe included studies including their risk of bias.
All in- cluded trials were comparis on trials of oral L-carnitine against placebo or control in the setting of acute MI.All background medications and baseline characteris- tics were statistically similar between the comparison groups in each trial. Quality assessment Table 2 summarizes the qual ity indicators of the in- cluded trials.All five studies scored well on the meth- odological qua lity indicators.Study outcomes All five trials (n = 3108) reported on all-cause mortality (Figure 2).The interaction test yielded no significant differences between the effects of the four daily main- tenance dosages of L-carnitine (i.e., 2 g, 3 g, 4 g, and 6 g)on all-cause mortality (RR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.57-1.03], P= 0.08) (Figure 2).Analysis of the all-cause mortality risk ratios for each dosage yi elded a statistically insig- nificant trend favoring the 3 g dose (RR = 0.48) over the lower 2 g dose (RR = 0.62), which was favored over the higher 4 g and 6 g doses (RR = 0.78, 0.78).
Therewas low heterogeneity between trials for all-cause mor- tality (I 2=2 2 % ) .

Discussion Although L-carnitine supplementation has been associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, ven-tricular arrhythmia, and angina in the setting of acute MI [7], this systematic review and meta-analysis of five con- trolled trials (n = 3108) found that there is no significantmarginal benefit in terms of all-cause mortality, heart fail- ure, unstable angina, or myocardial reinfarction for oral L-carnitine maintenance doses of greater than two gramsper day. However, analysis of the all-cause mortality risk ratios for each dosage yielded a statistically insignificant trend favoring the 3 g dose over the lower 2 g dose, whichwas favored over the higher 4 g and 6 g doses.
Although a statistically insignificant trend, this profile creates a bell- shaped curve with the 3 g dose as the optimal dosage interms of all-cause mortality.The human body's carnitine pool, consisting of free L-carnitine and its esters, is maintained by (i) absorp-tion of L-carnitine from dietary sources, (ii) endogenous biosynthesis from two essential amino acids (lysine and methionine) in the kidney, liver and brain, and (iii) exten-sive renal tubular reabsorption (98-99%) from glomerular filtrate [17]. The absorption of oral L-carnitine occurs via both passive diffusion and carrier-mediated transport,which ensures high tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios in tissues that depend critically on fatty acid oxidation.The bioavailability from conventional oral supplements(one to six grams) ranges from a mere 5-18% [17].One reason for this low bioavailability is a significant propor- tion of L-carnitine supplementation is metabolized bymicrobiota prior to absorption [18,19].
Human microbiota are responsible for converting L-carnitine and other dietary quaternary amines (e.g., choline, glycine betaine,and phosphatidylcholine) to trimethylamine (TMA), which are subsequently oxidized by host hepatic flavin monooxygenases to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO),a molecule that promotes atherogenesis through its interaction with macroph ages and lipid metabolism [20,21]. Thus, gut microbiota may not only reduce L-carnitine bioavilability but also promote TMAO-induced atherosclerotic risk.
Interestingly, this limited bioavaila bility of oral L-carnitine supplements may have been a motivating rationale for the high dosing of oral L-carnitineTable 1 Characteristics of included studies Study Sample size (n) AMI index event typeLoading dose of L-carnitineOral maintenance dose of L-carnitineOutcomes Risk of Bias† L-carnitine treatedControl Davini 1992 81 79 AMI None 4 g/day Death ◘◘◘ Iliceto 1995 233 239 AMI 9 g/day × 5 days (intravenous)6 g/day Death, bypass surgery, heart failure, early postinfarction angina, ventricular arrhythmia◘◘○ Singh 1996 51 50 100% STEMI None 2 g/day Death, heart failure, unstable angina, reinfarction◘◘○ Iyer 1999 23 23 Anterior AMI 6 g/day × 7 days (oral) 3 g/day Death ◘◘◘ Tarantini 2006 1168 1161 100% STEMI 9 g/day × 5 days (intravenous)4 g/day Death ○○○ †Risk of bias assessment based on (i) sequence generation of allocation, (ii) allocation concealment, and (iii) blinding.

Although gut micro- biome profiles and L-carnitine bioavailability were not reported in the studies included in this meta-analysis, future studies should measure these variables whenassessing the efficacy and dosing of L-carnitine in CVD patients, as certain gut microbiota species (e.g., Gam- maproteobacteria ,Betaproteobacteria ,a n d Firmicutes , including Acinetobacter species) [22] can display a par- ticularly adverse influence on the bioavailability of L-carnitine supplementatio n as well as atherosclerotic risk through TMA production. As the vast majority (>95%) of the human body's carni- tine pool is located in skeletal muscle, the dynamics ofskeletal muscle carnitine may influence the metabolism of L-carnitine supplementation.In humans, increased plasmaconcentrations have not been conclusively associated with an increase in the skeletal muscle carnitine pool [23].
This phenomenon may be due to saturation of L-carnitine transport into skeletal muscle at physiological L-carnitineplasma concentrations (40 –60μmol/l) and/or by the sig- nificantly higher carnitine concentration in skeletal muscle relative to plasma, rendering passive transport impossible[24]. However, other human studies have found opposing results.Studies providing month-long oral supplementa- tion of 2 g of L-carnitine per day to long-distance runners(which consume large amounts of carbohydrates for training) showed a ~10% increase in skeletal muscle carnitine content [25,26].Moreover, recent studies byStephens and Wall providing human subjects with twice daily 1.36 g L-carnitine in combination with a beverage Figure 2 Forest plot of risk ratios for all-cause mortality.Figure 3 Forest plot of risk ratios for heart failure, unstable angina, and myocardial reinfarction.Shang et al.
BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2014, 14:88 Page 5 of 7 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/14/88 containing 80 g of carbohydrate reported a 20% increase in skeletal muscle carnitine content over a 12-week period and a 30% increase in skeletal muscle carnitine contentover a 24-week period [27,28]. These discrepancies may be explained by the hypothesis th at L-carnitine supplementa- tion accompanied by high amo unts of carbohydrate intake increases skeletal muscle OCTN2 expression through an insulin-mediated mechanism, thereby increasing skeletal muscle carnitine content [28,29].Althoughskeletal muscle carnitine content and carbohydrate intake were not reported in the studies included in this meta-analysis, future stud ies should measure these variables when assessing the efficacy and dosing of L- carnitine in CVD patients, as these factors may influence thein vivo metabolism of L-carnitine supplementation.
Although previous studies have shown L-carnitine to have cardioprotective effects [4-7], recent studies have also shown that derivatives of L-carnitine may haveadverse consequences on cardiovacular health. As dis- cussed earlier, Koeth et al.'s study on gut microbiota- induced TMAO in stable patients undergoing cardiacevaluation showed significan t dose-dependent associa- tions between plasma L-carnitine levels and risks of coronary artery disease, peri pheral artery disease, and overall CVD after correction for common CVD risk factors [18].Moreover, the same study demonstrated that elevated fasting plasma L-carnitine levels are anindependent predictor of major adverse cardiac events after correction for common CVD risk factors [18].
In another recent clinical study, higher plasma levels ofthe L-carnitine derivates acet ylcarnitine and palmitoyl- carnitine have been associated with higher degrees of heart failure, and higher plasma levels of palmitoylcarnitine have been associated with higher rates of all-cause mortality and heart transplantation [30]. As these recent studies show that higher oral doses ofL-carnitine can promote atherogenesis and CVD risk, these findings also support our contention of limiting the oral maintenance dosing of L-carnitine to 3 g perday in the setting of acute MI and call for further investigation on the long-term risks of chronic L- carnitine supplementation in CVD patients.Several limitations to this study should be noted here.First, three of the five trials included in the meta-analysis possessed a relatively small number of patients (n < 200) –the two large trials, Iliceto 1995 (n = 472) and Tarantini 2006 (n = 2329), contributed 87% of themortality events.
However, we found low heterogeneity between the five trials in all-cause mortality (I 2= 22%) (Figure 2) and detected no heterogeneity between thetwo trials reporting heart failure (I 2=0 % ) , u n s t a b l e a n - gina (I2= 0%), and myocardial reinfarction (I2=0 % ) (Figure 3). Second, due to lack of reported data, wecould not analyze L-carnitine dosing in the secondaryprevention of ventricular arrythmia in the setting of acute MI.Third, all included studies were conducted prior to 2006; as standard treatment regimens for acuteMI patients have changed substantially since then (e.g., revascularization with dua l antiplatelet therapy, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), the potential benefits ofL-carnitine will need to be reassessed in the context of current treatment regimens that may affect the pharma- cokinetics of L-carnitine.Fourth, only the effects of thefour daily oral maintenance dosages (2 g, 3 g, 4 g, and 6 g) were analyzed here.
Therefore, we could not ascer- tain whether daily oral maintenance doses under 2 g ora b o v e6ga r ee q u a l l ye f f e c t i v e ,n o rd i dw ee x a m i n et h e effects of different initial loading administrations. Fifth, due to lack of reported data, we could not analyze thedietary patterns, medication usage, gut microbiome profiles, L-carnitine bioavailability, or skeletal muscle carnitine content of the patients included in this meta-analysis, which may have had differential effects on the metabolism of L-carnitine.Sixth, the follow-up periods of the included trials were relatively short-term (one totwelve months); therefore, interpretation of these find- ings are restricted to shorter-term outcomes.
Seventh, these results should not be a pplied to patients with pri- mary carnitine deficiency (typ ically arising from genetic alterations in renal handling or muscle transport of L-carnitine) or secondary carni tine deficiency (typically arising from impaired renal tubular resorption from drug toxicity or hemodialysis). Other studies have analyzed the pharmacokinetics and provided dosing recommendationsregarding L-carnitine in these patients [31,32].Conclusions There appears to be no signi ficant marginal benefit in terms of all-cause mortality, heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial reinfarction in the setting ofacute MI for oral L-carnitine maintenance doses of g r e a t e ro rl e s st h a n3gp e rd a y .Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors ’contributions RS conceived and designed the experiments.RS and ZS collected the data.ZS and HL analyzed the data.RS and HL drafted and critically revised themanuscript.
