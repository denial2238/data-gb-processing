The observed influence on hormones is in line with existing PCOS theoriesregarding cyst development, further enhancing the therapeutic promise of vitamin E. Conclusion: In conclusion, our computational analysis indicates that vitamin E shows potential as a therapeutic agent for alleviating PCOS in adolescents.Plain language summary: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects many girls and young women during their reproductive years.PCOS can lead to problems with the menstrual cycle, difficulties with blood sugar control and sometimes infertility.Unfortunately, there’s no specifictreatment for PCOS yet.This study looked at whether vitamin E might be helpful in treating PCOS in young women.To find out, the researchersused advanced computer-basedtechniquesand analyzed how vitamin E interacts with various parts of the body, including proteins and hormones.Vitamin E appearsto influence hormones that play a role in PCOS and cyst formation.
It may also have anti-inflammatory properties that could help reduce the symptoms of PCOS. In short, this study suggests that vitamin E might be a valuable option for treating PCOS in adolescents.However, further research and clinical trialsare needed to confirm these findings before it can become a standard treatment.This research opens up new possibilities for finding effective solutions for PCOS, which can greatly improve the quality of life for many young women.First draft submitted: 18 October 2023; Accepted for publication: 7 December 2023; Published online: 17 April 2024 Keywords: computational approach •in silico •network pharmacology •polycystic ovarian syndrome •vitamin E Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a widely prevalent and intricate endocrine disorder impacting a substantial number (5–15%) of women across the globe [1].It is identiﬁed by a mix of irregularities in hormone levels and disruptions in metabolism, which can lead to various health-related issues.
PCOS is renowned for its varied array of symptoms and its potential to affect numerous facets of a woman’s life, encompassing fertility, menstrualpatterns and overall health and well-being [2]. Recognizing the signiﬁcance of comprehending PCOS is crucial, as it not only exerts an inﬂuence on a woman’s reproductive health but also carries implications for her long-term well-being.This has rendered PCOS a subject of considerable interest and investigation within the domains of gynecology, endocrinology and reproductive medicine [3,4].PCOS is a multifaceted disorder characterized by an array of symptoms and possible complications, necessitating treatment plans that target particular symptoms.These approaches can encompass lifestyle adjustments, pharmaceutical interventions and, on occasion, surgical Future Sci.OA (2024) FSO952 eISSN 2056-5623 10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 C⃝2024 Dr.Rukaiah Fatma Begum Research Article Begum & Mohan procedures.
Below are some typical methods for addressing PCOS [5,6]. The emergence of PCOS is inﬂuenced by a complex interplay of an individual’s genetic and environmental factors.Genetic elements encompass a family history of PCOS among immediate relatives, early onset of sexual maturity and preterm fetal development.Environmental factors encompass a sedentary lifestyle, consumption of high-fat, high-sugar and high-salt junk food, exposure toadvanced glycation end products (AGEs) and obesity [7].The management of PCOS is diverse and personalized, taking into account the unique requirements and objectives of every patient.Moreover, except for estrogen-progestin combinations, there are no medications authorized for the explicit purpose of addressing metabolic irregularitiesand excess androgens.Consequently, the majority of drugs are prescribed for uses not ofﬁcially approved [8].
In adolescents, the diagnosis of PCOS is a subject of debate, leading to inconsistency in both evaluation and treatment. Unfortunately, the requirements of young women with PCOS are not being sufﬁciently fulﬁlled [9].Medications such as metformin, oral contraceptives and myoinositol can provide assistance to adolescents dealingwith PCOS [10].It’s important to note that oral contraceptives should not be prescribed to teenagers for durations exceeding 3 years [11].Nutritional research emphasizes the signiﬁcance of dietary adjustments in managing this condition.Girls with PCOS generally align with recommended macronutrient distribution ranges for carbohydrates,proteins and fats [12].However, there were no observed distinctions in dietary quality or food intake between women with and without PCOS.
This highlights the need for novel guidelines that advocate for the integration of healthy lifestyle modiﬁcations as a key element of treatment, considering the absence of a speciﬁc and deﬁcient dietarytarget for interventions [13]. In this introductory discourse, we shall delve into the essential attributes, causative factors, diagnostic approaches and prospective therapeutic interventions associated with PCOS, emphasizing the critical need to address thiscondition for the betterment of women’s health.Currently, owing to the unclear origin of PCOS, there is noestablished and efﬁcacious treatment regimen.Clinical practice primarily relies on managing symptoms and ongoing health maintenance is essential.Vitamin E, a type of antioxidant vitamin that dissolves in fats, has attracted attention for its potential role in addressing certain symptoms linked to PCOS.Vitamin E is known for its ability to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body.
Oxidative stress, which occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, is associated with the pathophysiology of PCOS. Elevated oxidative stress can exacerbate inﬂammation and insulinresistance, common features of PCOS.Vitamin E’s antioxidant properties may help reduce oxidative stress and mitigate these effects [14].One hallmark of PCOS is insulin resistance, a condition where the body’s cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels.Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin E mayimprove insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients, potentially by reducing oxidative stress and inﬂammation.Improvedinsulin sensitivity can help manage glucose levels and decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes, which is often associated with PCOS [15,16].Vitamin E’s anti-inﬂammatory properties may help reduce inﬂammation in PCOS patients, potentially alleviating some of the associated symptoms [17].
For women with PCOS seeking to conceive, vitamin E supplementation may offer potential beneﬁts. By addressing insulin resistance and hormone imbalances, vitamin E could enhance fertility and increase the chances of successful pregnancy [18,19].Through computational methods, this study explores the hormonal and anti-inﬂammatory attributes of vitamin E.The study utilized network pharmacology, a method that explores the connections between diseases, genes and potential treatments.This approach aimed to uncover the molecular foundations of drug actions and biological systems, encompassing human organs, diseases, metabolic pathways and target proteins [20,21].Additionally, the study involved analyzing and summarizing pharmacokinetic parameters, potential adverse effects and toxicityassessments.Various online servers and web resources were employed during the study.
The ﬁnal conclusions were based on a combination of online and ofﬂine technologies, offering insights into different pharmacological aspects and parameters. The utilization of in silico methods to assess the pharmacology of drug candidates offers a comprehensive understanding of factors like absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity [22–24] .Consequently, it allows for the improvement of new compounds with a strong attraction to the speciﬁc target region.Methodology Screening of disease targets for PCOS & vitamin E We conducted searches using the terms ‘PCOS’ and ‘polycystic ovarian syndrome’ in online gene databases, including DisGeNet ( https://www.disgenet.org/ ), GeneCard ( https://www.genecards.org/ ).The gene data obtained from these searches were collated and duplicates were removed.Following data normalization using the UniProt 10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 Future Sci.
OA (2024) FSO952 Systematic exploration of network pharmacology, in silicomodeling & pharmacokinetic profiling for vitamin E in PCOS Research Article database, we identiﬁed relevant targets for PCOS treatment. Additionally, we conducted searches for the keywords ‘vitamin E’ and ‘alpha-tocopherol’ in Swiss Target Prediction ( http://swisstargetprediction.ch ) to identify genes associated with the compound.Constructing PPI networks & screening for crucial targets Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are of utmost importance in a diverse array of cellular processes and are indispensable for the functioning of living organisms.Grasping the intricacies of PPIs is critical for gaininginsights into the complexities of molecular biology, cellular signaling and the mechanisms underpinning various physiological and pathological processes.
T o construct a PPI network involving overlapping targets, the STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ ) was utilized, with a focus on ‘homo sapiens’ as the species. Subsequently, the PPI network was generated using Cytoscape V3.9.1.An in-depth analysis of the network was conducted through the Cytoscape network analyzer tool, which allowed the determination of degree values and accuracy.Following this analysis, the top ten targets with the highest degree scores were selected for subsequent in silico molecular docking.Enrichment analysis by GO & KEGG pathway The outcomes of pathway enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were utilized on the STRING online database ( https://string-db.org/ ) to label and categorize the 25 common targets.Subsequently, with a p-value cutoff of 0.05, we gathered and assessed the data employing Rstudio 3.6.3 (Bioconductor clusterProﬁler).
In silicomolecular docking According to the degree analysis and enrichment results of the GO and KEGG, we selected the top ten proteins which was further taken to molecular docking with vitamin E. The crystal structures of receptors were obtained from PDB protein database ( http://www.rcsb.org/ ) based on the sequence alignment and activity.The compound structure was obtained from the pubchem ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) in SDF format and was converted to PDB by Open Babel GUI 2.4.1 for docking interpretation.Molecular docking was performed out further with AutoDock Vina tool 1.5.6.After the removal of water molecules and the addition of hydrogen atoms to improvethe stability of amino acid residues in their various forms, the reﬁned protein structure was further optimized.This corrected protein structure was then saved as a ‘protein.pdb’ ﬁle, which was used in all subsequent docking experiments.
By removing water and ligands connected by covalent bonds, adjustments were made to the bondorder. This process included the application of charge and protonation states within the molecular mechanics forceﬁeld to achieve energy minimization.AutoDock Vina software was used to calculate Gasteiger charges and evaluate the ligand’s rotatable bonds.This process generated various conformations for docking.For each receptor, receptor grids were created by deﬁning grid points (size x,y,z with 40 ×40×40, respectively) and the grid boxes were built using these reference axes with the exhaustiveness of 8 [25,26].The binding afﬁnity between the molecule and proteins is predicted based on docking minimum free energy.The results were saved in pdbqt ﬁle which was visualized and presented by Biovia Discovery Studio 2021 client.
Estimation of pharmacokinetic profile The canonical SMILES notation for vitamin E was obtained from the PubChem web server and subjectedto pharmacokinetic assessments using pkCSM and Swiss ADME [27]. These assessments, based on the canonical SMILES, provide valuable information about the drug’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity.pkCSM, a reliable online tool, is well-suited for exploring medication pharmacokinetics and has been previously utilized to analyze the physicochemical properties and analgesic efﬁcacy of N-benzoyl thiourea derivatives [28].Toxicity prediction It is crucial to carry out toxicological evaluations when withdrawing a drug to avoid potential adverse effects,including organ system failure or harm.The compounds’ chemical composition was compared with PubChem data to determine their toxicity proﬁle, using the OSIRIS R⃝property explorer program.
This assessment utilizes a color-coded scale to measure characteristics such as tumorigenicity, mutagenicity, irritant potential, reproductiveeffects and drug suitability [29,30]. It also produces values for factors like T opological Polar Surface Area (TPSA), drug similarity and anf overall drug rating.Here, the color green represents a low risk of toxicity, yellow indicates a moderate risk of toxicity and red signiﬁes a high risk of toxicity 10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 Research Article Begum & Mohan Biological activity prediction using PASS online tool The online tool Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) was employed to predict the biological activity of the drugs.By analyzing the structural formula of the compound the tool projects their biological activity spectrum, emphasizing the link between structure and function [31,32].Biological activity is a crucial aspect of the characteristics of chemical compounds, as it determines their utility in medical applications [33].
Additionally, the PASS ONLINE website resource was used to anticipate the potential side effects of these drugs. The PASS online software is employed for assessing biologically active substances, offering predictions for over a huge number of drugpharmacological actions and biochemical mechanisms, all according to the structural formula of the substances.This predictive capability can aid in the identiﬁcation of novel pharmacological targets [34].Molecular property & bioactivity score assessment Computational testing of the chosen drugs was carried out using MOLINSPIRATIONR⃝cheminformatics software to assess drug resemblance and forecast bioactivity [35].The bioactivity score, which falls within the range of -0.50– 0.00, indicates moderate activity, with a score of 0.00 signifying inactivity.Medications with a bioactivity grade below 0.00 are considered to possess optimal biological activity.
Results Target screening & prediction of PCOS & vitamin E A comprehensive screening process initially identiﬁed 2891 proteins associated with PCOS-related target genes, sourced from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases, after eliminating duplicates. In parallel, 100 proteins were identiﬁed as vitamin E-related target genes using Swiss target prediction ( Figure 1 ).These two sets were consequently merged, resulting in the identiﬁcation of a ﬁnal set of 25 common target genes, as depicted in theVenn diagram ( Figure 2 ).Subsequently, these 25 common target genes were then subjected to further analysis in PPI studies.Constructing of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network The target genes were inputted into the STRING online database to create a PPI network consisting of 26 nodes(genes), resulting in the identiﬁcation of 80 edges (interactions), as depicted in Figure 3 .T o visualize the protein interactions within the PPI network, Cytoscape v 3.9.1 was employed.
Following that, the network analyzer was employed to determine the degree values of the shared target genes, a crucial metric for assessing network nodes. According to these degree values, the top ten targets were AKT1, PTGS2, PPARG, PPARA, ESR1, LDLR, GSK3B, CNR1, ACE andESR2, with degrees of 17, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7 and 6, respectively.Additionally, topological parameters such as betweeness centrality and closeness centrality was determined for all 25 common target genes (Table 1 ).These targets serve as central hubs within the PPI network, connecting and inﬂuencing various nodes.Exploration of KEGG pathways & GO function enrichment We conducted GO enrichment analysis and the top ten results for biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MFs) and cellular components (CCs) are presented in Figure 4 .
These results indicate that the biological processes involve the regulation of fatty acids and lipid metabolic processes, blood pressure regulation, cellular ketone metabolic processes and cell differentiation. In terms of molecular functions relevant to drug-disease interactions,the analysis revealed activities such as nuclear receptor function, steroid hormone receptor activity, drug binding andRNA and DNA transcription factor binding.The KEGG enrichment analysis was used to identify the associated pathways for vitamin E.We identiﬁed 154 signaling pathways, with the top ten mentioned in Figure 5 .Notably, the analysis emphasized pathways like insulin resistance, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR) [36], thyroid hormone signaling and the prolactin signaling pathway.Compound target disease network The compound-target-disease (CTD) network diagram, visualizing the relationship between vitamin E and PCOS,was generated using CytoScape 3.9.1.
This network consisted of more than 109 nodes connected by 133 edges(interactions) and it exhibited a zero clustering coefﬁcient, as depicted in Figure 6 . Within this network, 26 nodes represented the common target genes associated with the drug-disease interaction and these were highlighted.The top ten targets based on topological parameters included AKT1, PTGS2, PPARG, PPARA, ERS1, LDLR, GSK3B, 10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 Future Sci.

Swiss target prediction for vitamin E. CNR1, ACE andESR2 .These genes are considered as potential targets for vitamin E in the context of PCOS treatment.In silicomolecular docking We conducted an extensive exploration through molecular docking simulations to evaluate vitamin E’s capability to inhibit various targets linked to hormonal, oxidative stress and inﬂammatory pathways related to PCOS progression.The calculated binding strengths for all the suggested targets fell within a range from -5.3 to -9.3 kcal /mol ( Table 2 ).While some receptors displayed more robust binding afﬁnities, suggesting strong hydrogen bond interactions, only a speciﬁc subset exhibited exceptional biochemical interactions within the binding site of the protein target.
We employed the Discovery Studio Visualizer software to scrutinize various targets with high binding energy, with thegoal of comprehending the molecular interactions and pinpointing the particular amino acid residues responsible for these interactions at the receptor’s binding site ( Figure 7 ). Higher binding afﬁnities, ranging from -9.3 to -7.5 kcal /mol, signify a more robust attachment to the target, whereas afﬁnities within the -6.0 to -5.3 kcal /mol range indicate somewhat weaker yet still signiﬁcant binding.This range allows for a comparison of binding strengthsacross different receptors.Receptors with more negative values are likely to be more attractive targets for vitamin E.

Nonetheless, in the comprehensive procedures of drug formulation, development and exploration, itis imperative to incorporate essential pharmacokinetic features and ADMET considerations as pivotal components.The online tool pkCSM provided a comprehensive analysis of the ADMET parameters for the compound, along with a detailed assessment of its physicochemical properties ( Table 3 ).
Subsequently, further scrutiny of the ADMET characteristics ( Table 4 ), such as lipophilicity ( Table 5 ) and water solubility ( Table 6 ), was carried out using the Swiss adme online web tool Lipinski’s Rule of Five was utilized to forecast the physicochemical properties essential for a molecule’s effectiveness, safety and metabolism [37]. This evaluation revealed variations in log P across three different parameters: Consensus Log Po /w, Log Po /w (WLOGP) and Log Po /w (XLOGP3).The latter three, encompassing atomistic and topological adjustments via Moriguchi’s topological method, were employed to assess the logarithm of the partition coefﬁcient within the lipophilicity range.The consensus log Po /w value was derived as an average of the ﬁve predictive values mentioned earlier, while SILICOS-IT incorporated a hybrid methodologyinvolving fragments and topological descriptors to estimate the log Po /w.
Collectively, these outcomes suggest that all the proposed inhibitors possess pharmacological or drug-like attributes suitable for oral administration. Despite having a low hydrophilicity score of -6.901, vitamin E exhibits a substantial intestinal absorption rate of approximately 89.782%, making it a promising candidate for oral administration.Additionally, other parameters, including blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability (log BB) and central nervous system (CNS) permeability (log PS), were found to be 0.876 and -1.669, respectively.These criteria offer understanding into a compound’s capacityto navigate biological barriers, yet they constitute merely a single aspect of the drug development journey.Otherpivotal elements, including toxicity, metabolism and interactions with targets, also exert substantial inﬂuence on a compound’s viability as a drug.

These results suggest the absence of inhibition of P-glycoprotein II (P-gp), a protein involved in drug transport.The inhibition of P-gp can impact a drug’s bioavailability and distribution within the body and while it may be desirable in speciﬁc therapeutic contexts, it can also pose clinical challengesduring drug development.Additionally, vitamin E was found to be a CYP3A4 andCYP2C19 inhibitor, further indicating its effective absorption and signiﬁcant pharmacological properties [38].The comprehensive removal of vitamin E from the body is represented by a 0.794 log ml /min/kg clearance value, signifying an efﬁcient elimination process.
Notably, the web-based tool indicates that the highest dose ofvitamin E that humans can tolerate is 0.775 log m /kg/day and the LD 50value, which measures the lethal dose for 50% of the population, is determined to be 2.072 mol /kg.

This method produces positive bioactivity scores for potential therapeutic targets.Toxicity prediction T oxicological assessments for the experimental inhibitors in this investigation were conducted through the use of OSIRIS Property Explorer.It is of utmost importance to rigorously scrutinize and validate a drug’s toxicity proﬁle before progressing to clinical trials.The toxicity parameters for the compounds examined in this study, as presentedinTable 7 , revealed that vitamin E exhibited a safe proﬁle, with no indications of mutagenicity, tumorigenicity, irritancy, or adverse effects on reproduction.The majority of the proposed inhibitors demonstrated favorable toxicity proﬁles, rendering them promising options for treatment.
The OSIRIS Property Explorer consistentlydelivered positive evaluations across all the aforementioned aspects, afﬁrming the safety proﬁle of these compounds. The T otal Polar Surface Area (TPSA) of a molecule holds signiﬁcant importance in determining its capacity for absorption and tissue penetration.As per the OSIRIS Property Explorer, the T opological Polar Surface Area (TPSA) measurement for the substance was recorded at 29.46.Furthermore, the compound’s average drug-likeness scorewas -4.78.The drug score, which takes into account factors such as molecular weight, toxicity risks and cLogP , is instrumental in assessing whether a chemical compound possesses the potential to meet the criteria for being a viable drug.Vitamin E obtained a drug score of 0.12, indicating its suitability for medical use.Pass online web resource The Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) online tool was employed to anticipate the biological activity of the drugs.

The range spanning from -0.50 to 0.00represents a scale where values closer to -0.50 indicate lower to moderate bioactivity, while values approaching0.00 suggest a lack of bioactivity or inactivity. A bioactivity score of 0.00 is typically considered neutral, indicating that the compound or drug is inactive.Within this range, values closer to 0.00 imply a decrease in activity as 10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 Future Sci.OA (2024) FSO952 Systematic exploration of network pharmacology, in silicomodeling & pharmacokinetic profiling for vitamin E in PCOS Research Article the bioactivity score moves away from -0.50.The assertion that drugs with a score below 0.00 exhibit optimal biological activity suggests that, in this scoring system, lower (more negative) values are associated with higher biological activity.This corresponds with the idea that, in certain cases, compounds with stronger binding afﬁnity or more potent pharmacological effects receive lower scores [40].
Discussion PCOS is most prevalent among women and adolescents of reproductive age, resulting in increased morbidity. It can give rise to various complications, including anovulation, oligoovulation and insulin resistance, ultimately leading to infertility and posing a signiﬁcant risk to women’s reproductive well-being.Unfortunately, a deﬁnitivetreatment for this condition remains elusive.The exact cause of PCOS remains unclear, but it is relied on to involvea combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors [41].Existing treatments may not effectively address all the varied symptoms and manifestations of PCOS, ranging from hormonal imbalances to metabolic issues and fertility challenges.Some medications used for PCOS management may have side effects and not all patientstolerate them well.This can impact adherence to treatment plans and overall effectiveness.
While some treatments can induce ovulation, they might not adequately address fertility challenges or improve reproductive outcomes for all women with PCOS. The long-term safety of certain PCOS medications, especially with extended use, mayraise concerns.Exploring alternative treatments with a favorable safety proﬁle is essential.PCOS is a heterogeneous condition and individual responses to standard treatments can vary signiﬁcantly.Tailoring treatments to individual patient needs remains a challenge.The role of vitamin E in the context of PCOS is an area of growing interest and investigation.Vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress, which can lead to inﬂammation and tissue damage.In PCOS, oxidative stress is thought to be one of the contributing factors to the development of insulin resistance, a key feature of the syndrome [42].Several studies have explored the potential beneﬁts of vitamin E in managing PCOS.
Vitamin E has been investigated for its ability to reduce oxidative stress, improve insulin sensitivity and potentially ameliorate some of the symptoms associated with PCOS, such as irregular menstrual cycles and androgen excess. One of the notable ﬁndings in these studies is the potential of vitamin E to mitigateoxidative stress, which may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance and hormonal imbalance in PCOS [43].By reducing oxidative stress, vitamin E could improve insulin sensitivity, potentially leading to better glycemic control in women with PCOS.Additionally, vitamin E’s antioxidant properties may have a positive impacton reproductive health in women with PCOS.Some research suggests that it may help regulate menstrual cycles,promote ovulation and reduce androgen levels.These effects are promising for women with PCOS who often face challenges related to fertility and hormonal imbalances [44,45].
Although vitamin E is generally deemed safe when consumed within recommended dietary limits, an excess intake may result in potential side effects. It’s crucial tohighlight that the adverse effects mentioned, such as digestive issues like nausea, diarrhea and stomach cramps, as well as impacts on immune function and hormonal balance, are commonly linked to elevated doses of vitamin E, frequently stemming from supplements [46].Our ﬁndings highlights the integration of network pharmacology, ADMET studies and in silico molecular docking provides a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacological properties, safety proﬁle and potential therapeutic mechanisms of action of the compound.This multidisciplinary approach aids in the identiﬁcationof central hub genes, critical biological processes and potential therapeutic targets.In recent years, networkpharmacology has emerged as a valuable tool for exploring the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases like PCOS.
By leveraging the power of bioinformatics, data mining and network analysis, researchers have aimed to gain a deeper understanding of PCOS at a molecular level and identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we have examined the signiﬁcance of network pharmacology concerning PCOS.We conducted an analysis of key targets by integrating PPI networks with the CTD network approach to comprehensively understand the interactions between a compound, its target proteins and the biological pathways involved.In the context ofexploring vitamin E’s potential in alleviating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), this approach can shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects.Identiﬁed target proteins are mapped to biological pathways using pathway analysis tools.This step helps elucidate the broader impact of vitamin E on cellularprocesses and signaling cascades.
High-throughput omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics,can be integrated to validate and reﬁne pathway information. This step provides a systems-level understanding of vitamin E’s effects.10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 Research Article Begum & Mohan Notably, our investigation highlighted speciﬁc targets, including AKT1, PTGS2, PPARG, PPARA, ESR1, LDLR, GSK3B, CNR1, ACE andESR2 .Vitamin E was found to exhibit a targeting effect on various proteins, including protein kinase, PPARs and estrogen receptors.These interactions are associated with critical pathways involved in endocrine regulation, ovarian steroidogenesis, insulin resistance and signaling through PPARs, thyroid hormones,prolactin, cortisol and estrogen.The AKT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in various ovarian functions, including folliculogenesis.
Additionally, it is involved in mediating cell growth and apoptosis triggered by androgens, making it an attractive target for addressing PCOS Similarly, PPAR has a signiﬁcant impact on fertility in both menand women, given its expression in the reproductive system, hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which collectively regulate hormonal balance. PPAR plays a role in regulating progesterone secretion while reducing androstenedione and testosterone levels [47,48].In the context of PCOS, estrogen is a key hormone and its receptors ESR1 and ESR2 are responsible for regulating cyclic gonadotropin release through the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis.Theestrogen pathway is vital in the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids, insulin function, follicle growth and the maturation and release of oocytes [49,50].
The protective function of vitamin E extends to mitigating oxidative stress by counteracting the impact of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular processes,potentially preventing degenerative diseases like PCOS and cancer. Vitamin E is recognized for its ability to hinder lipid peroxidation, a chain reaction that produces detrimental lipid hydroperoxides.Network pharmacology studies have indicated its inﬂuence on the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, which can be disrupted by ROS andoxidized lipids, leading to the formation of inﬂammatory cytokines [51].Antioxidants, including vitamin E, operate through non-enzymatic mechanisms, effectively neutralizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cells and converting it into the less reactive superoxide, assisted by other antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD)and catalase [52].Vitamin E has been reported to modulate signaling pathways associated with inﬂammation.
For instance, it can impact the activity of NF- κB, a transcription factor involved in the expression of pro-inﬂammatory genes. By regulating NF- κB, vitamin E may downregulate the production of inﬂammatory mediators [53].T h e s e factors collectively emphasize the potential value of vitamin E in the management of PCOS, especially concerningissues related to ovulation.These networking pathways was further analysed in in silico docking method, in which these top ten protein were docked with vitamin E to study the binding afﬁnity.Surprisingly, the PPAR and estrogen receptors highestdocking scores (-9.3 /-7.8/-7.5 Kcal /mol) which showed the potential to provide the biological activity for PCOS.The robust binding interactions identiﬁed in the molecular docking investigations indicate that vitamin E could potentially inﬂuence crucial proteins associated with PCOS.
The identiﬁcation of amino acid residues involvedin binding interactions and the presence of strong hydrogen bond interactions contribute to the understandingof its potential inhibitory effects. These ﬁndings highlight the compound’s suitability as a therapeutic agent targeting speciﬁc proteins and pathways associated with the medical condition under investigation.This paves the way for additional experimental conﬁrmation to establish the impact on hormonal levels and anti-inﬂammatorycharacteristics.Further exploration of the compound was carried out by ADMET studies through online web tools such as SwissAdme, OSIRIS, PASS and MOLINSPIRATION including its intestinal absorption rate and the absence of P-gp inhibition, suggest its suitability for oral administration.Additionally, its inhibitory effects on keycytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4 andCYP2C19, further emphasize its pharmacological potential.The study’s constraints encompass various aspects.
In network pharmacology, the reliance on the integration of diverse data sources introduces a dependency on the quality and comprehensiveness of these datasets andincomplete or biased data may compromise the reliability of network analyses. Moreover, the current knowledgeof biological pathways, subject to constant updates, may contain gaps in understanding speciﬁc interactions and pathways related to vitamin E in the context of PCOS.The tissue- or context-speciﬁc effects of vitamin E may not always be fully captured by network pharmacology, as interactions and pathways can exhibit variations acrossdifferent biological environments.Docking studies, on the other hand, tend to simplify ligand–protein interactions by assuming rigid structures and disregarding dynamic conformational changes.This simpliﬁcation might not fully represent the intricate nature of interactions within a biological system.
The prediction of accurate binding siteson proteins poses a challenge and inaccuracies in binding site prediction can undermine the reliability of docking results. Additionally, the commonly neglected solvent effects in docking studies, crucial in real biological systems, may lead to deviations from actual binding energies.In the realm of ADME studies, challenges arise in extrapolatingﬁndings from one species to another, given the variability in the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of vitamin Eamong different organisms.In vitro ADME studies may not entirely capture the in vivo dynamics of vitamin E metabolism and distribution, limiting the generalization of results to real physiological conditions.Furthermore, 10.2144/fsoa-2023-0245 Future Sci.
OA (2024) FSO952 Systematic exploration of network pharmacology, in silicomodeling & pharmacokinetic profiling for vitamin E in PCOS Research Article the formulation of vitamin E supplements plays a signiﬁcant role in its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion and this factor is not always adequately considered in ADME studies. The combined results from network pharmacology, ADMET studies and molecular docking support the com- pound’s potential as a promising candidate for the treatment of the medical condition.Additional experimentalveriﬁcation and clinical investigations are necessary to validate its effectiveness and safety as a treatment.The utiliza- tion of in silico computational methods serves as an alternative to animal testing, offering deeper insights into how an organism may react to a chemical stressor [54].Numerous therapeutic approaches have been proposed, aiming to address multiple proteins associated with disease progression.
This underscores the importance of concurrently targeting these proteins to achieve a comprehensive grasp of the disease. Conclusion In conclusion, the integration of in silico molecular docking studies and pharmacokinetic assessments provides valuable insights into the potential therapeutic role of Vitamin E in PCOS.The molecular docking simulationshave shed light on the plausible interactions between Vitamin E and key molecular targets associated with PCOS, suggesting a potential mechanism of action.Additionally, pharmacokinetic assessments have provided crucial information about the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of Vitamin E, contributing to ourunderstanding of its bioavailability and potential efﬁcacy in PCOS treatment.These computational approaches offer a valuable preliminary framework for further experimental validation and clinical studies.
While in silico studies provide a theoretical foundation, it is essential to conduct rigorous in vitro andin vivo experiments to validate the predicted interactions and assess the actual therapeutic beneﬁts of Vitamin E in PCOS. Moreover, considering the multifaceted nature of PCOS, a holistic approach that combines various treatment modalities and addresses the diverse aspects of the syndrome may be crucial for achieving optimal outcomes.In summary, the amalgamation of in silico molecular docking and pharmacokinetic assessments provides a promising avenue for drug discovery and development in PCOS, with Vitamin E emerging as a potential candidate worthy of further exploration.Continued research endeavors are imperative to bridge the gap between computational predictions and clinical applications, ultimately advancing our understanding of PCOS pathophysiology andpaving the way for more effective therapeutic interventions.
Although these discoveries are promising, it is crucial to acknowledge that the utilization of vitamin E at its currently available doses (200 and 400 mg) as a therapeutic strategy for PCOS is an area of research that is still in the process of development. Further research, includingwell-designed clinical trials, is needed to establish its effectiveness and safety as part of PCOS management.Summary points •Network pharmacology studies have significantly contributed to unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms associated with PCOS and vitamin E, shedding light on its impact on signaling pathways.•The docking scores of PPAR and estrogen receptors, reaching as high as -9.3, -7.8 and -7.5 Kcal /mol, underscore the potential of vitamin E to exert biological activity in the context of PCOS.•ADME studies have elucidated the inhibitory effects of vitamin E on critical cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, further emphasizing its promising pharmacological potential.
