Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in exclusively breastfed infants after a 5-month iron supplementation Apinya Sittimol1, Puthita Saengpanit2, Nassawee Vatthana3 & Pat Rojmahamongkol4 Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is prevalent in exclusively breastfed (EBF) Thai infants.However, in Thailand, iron supplementation guidelines for EBF infants are not available.This prospective open- label study aimed to estimate the prevalence of IDA in 9-month-old EBF infants after receiving iron supplementation from 4 months of age until they consumed adequate iron-rich food.Forty-seven healthy, 4-month-old EBF infants were prescribed 1 mg/kg/day ferrous sulfate.Their complementary food records from 6 to 9 months were calculated for daily iron intak e.Complete blood count and iron study were performed at 9 months of age.The results showed that the prevalence of IDA at 9 months was 6.4%.An employed caregiver and the male sex of the baby were significantly associated with iron deficiency.
The food record revealed that the median daily iron intake was less than the Thai dietary reference intake recommendation. In summary, the prevalence of IDA in infants with 9 months of exclusive breastfeeding who received iron supplementation was lower than the background rate (25.7%) when iron was not prescribed.Most infants did not have adequate iron in complementary foods.Iron supplementation should be prescribed routinely during 4–9 months of age in healthy Thai EBF infants.Keywords Iron deficiency, Iron deficiency anemia, Anemia, Exclusively breastfed infants, Iron supplement Anemia is a common problem in children.This condition is defined as a hemoglobin concentration below 2 standard deviations from the population mean at the same age and gender1.In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the global prevalence of anemia was 39.8% in 6–59-month-old children2.The most common cause of anemia in these children is iron deficiency3.
Before children develop anemia, iron deficiency (ID) is an early stage where iron storage is insufficient to maintain normal physiological functions of the body1. When insufficiency progresses, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) generally develops slowly over the course of months or years4,5.IDA manifests itself as pallor6 and low hemoglobin level1.80% of the iron present in a newborn is accumulated during the third trimester of pregnancy1.At birth, deferred clamping of the umbilical cord for at least 60 s allows a substantial amount of blood to move from the placenta to the baby, leading to increased iron storage in the newborn7.However, this practice is common only in tertiary care hospitals in Thailand.During the first 6 months of age, infants receive adequate, well-absorbed iron from breast milk and the breakdown of red blood cells8.
However, this iron reserve will gradually decrease and reach its lowest point at approximately 6 months of age8, which can result in IDA in infants exclusively breastfed (EBF) beyond the age of 6 months. The WHO and other international organizations, as well as the Royal College of Pediatricians of Thailand and the Pediatric Society of Thailand, recommend exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 4–6 months of age1,8–11.As IDA is a preventable condition, there are guidelines for iron supplementation in EBF babies after 6 months of age.WHO and UNICEF advocate for nutritionally adequate complementary food at 6 months along with continuing breastfeeding for at least 2 years of age12.Regarding iron medication supplementation, the WHO promotes 10–12.5 mg of elemental iron daily for 3 consecutive months in years for infants and toddlers aged 6–23 months who live in the country with a high prevalence of anemia (40% prevalence)13.

email: patojung@yahoo.com OPEN Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:23924 1 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-74151-8 www.nature.com/scientificreports the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommends no iron supplementation for healthy European infants who had normal birth weight due to the low prevalence of IDA in infants in Europe ( < 2% before age 6 months, and 2–3% at age 6–9 months)10, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends 1 mg/kg/day of oral iron supplementation starting at 4 months of age until appropriate iron-containing complementary foods are introduced into the diet1. The prevalence of anemia in children aged 6–59 months in Thailand was 24.9%14.
Although Thai infants do not need iron supplements according to the WHO, the Royal College of Pediatricians of Thailand and the Pediatric Society of Thailand endorsed the guideline in 2014 that infants aged 6–24 months should receive 2 mg/kg/day of elemental iron only if they consume an inadequate amount of iron-rich complementary food or do not receive iron-fortified milk8. According to previous studies, the prevalence of IDA in 9–12 months old Thai infants increased from 14.3% in 200215to 17.9% in 201716.This prevalence was even higher in EBF infants (25.7%)15.The updated 2021 Thai national guideline does not specify on iron medication supplementation, but emphasizes the provision of one serving per day of complementary iron-rich foods as soon as infants reach 6 months old11, as well as the delivery of iron-rich foods consisting of at least 3 tablespoons of liver paste per week as a recommendation from the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand17.
Although previous studies did not have information on pediatricians’ compliance with 2014 national guidelines15,16, their findings raise questions about whether Thai EBF infants are able to ingest a sufficient amount of iron from their complementary food and whether iron supplement medication is necessary to prevent IDA in these infants and if so, what the appropriate duration of supplementation should be. More information on the feasibility of guideline implementation could help develop the Thai national child health supervision guideline for iron supplementation to prevent IDA in EBF infants.
The objectives of this study were (1) to explore the effect of iron supplementation in EBF infants at age 4 months on the efficacy of preventing iron deficiency by evaluating the prevalence of IDA in EBF infants at 9 months after receiving 1 mg/kg/day of iron supplement at 4 months of age until infants consumed an adequate amount of iron from complementary foods according to the AAP recommendation; (2) to assess the percentage of infants who consumed adequate iron intake at age 6–9 months; and (3) to study factors associated with iron deficiency in infants with exclusive breastfeeding at 9 months of age, which was the completion of iron supplementation. Methods Study design and participants This prospective (cohort) study was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board (COA no.Si 343/2022), and was performed according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline for introducing iron supplementation into infants.
This study was conducted between August 2022 and September 2023 in the Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. Caregivers of 4-month-old infants, who brought their children to the well child clinic and the continuity of care clinic for vaccination, were invited to the study.The inclusion criteria were healthy term infants who were exclusively breastfed (EBF).Some mothers of EBF infants do not provide sufficient breast milk, leading to infant formula feeding during the first few months of life.Therefore, we define exclusive breastfeeding as consuming primarily breast milk with less than 3 ounces/ day of formula during the first four months18.Infants were excluded if they were born preterm (less than 37 weeks of gestational age); had low birth weight (less than 2.5 kg), or had congenital or chronic diseases such as hematologic disease, cancer, chronic liver, or kidney disease.
Infants who received formula for more than half of their total daily intake when they were 4–6 months old were withdrawn from the study. The sample size calculation to estimate the prevalence based on the previous Honduran study18 that reported that the prevalence of IDA in EBF infants after iron medication supplementation was 9%.With a confidence level of 95% and an allowable error of 4.5%, the sample size required in this study was at least 196.Informed consent was obtained from all legal guardians before starting the study protocol.Tools The infant’s daily iron intake was evaluated using a 7-day food record.Caregivers were directly explained how to write the types and amounts of complementary food or milk in pieces, teaspoons, tablespoons or ounces; for example, two teaspoons of rice puree, half of boiled egg yolk, one piece of bread, two ounces of expressed breast milk.
Caregivers were also asked to record each meal of complementary food, expressed breast milk, and formula that participants consumed in a day for 7 consecutive days. The iron intake calculation was done using the computerized software Institute of Nutrition Mahidol University Calculation (INMUCAL)—Nutrients version 4.0, developed by the Institute of Nutrition of Mahidol University, Thailand, specifically to analyze the nutritional value of the consumption and recipes of Thai food.The iron study, which consisted of serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation, was tested using a Mindray BS-800 chemistry analyzer, and the complete blood count (CBC) was evaluated using Sysmex XN-1000/3000.Data collection • Demographic data including the age, sex, education, occupation and monthly income of the caregiver; the sex of the participant and the number of siblings.
• Food record that reported every meal of complementary food and milk that participants consumed in one day for seven consecutive days at the age 6, 7, 8, and 9 months. • Information on iron supplementation that consisted of the amount in milliliters per dose, the duration of the medication before or after food and milk, the side effect of the drug.Medication compliance was collected Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:23924 2 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-74151-8www.nature.com/scientificreports/ from the average number of days per week the participant took the medicine from the fourth to the ninth month.• CBC and iron study that included serum iron, TIBC and transferrin saturation.Procedure Participants came to the well-child clinic or the continuity of care clinic for vaccination at age 4, 6, and 9 months.
Medical history was recorded, physical examination was performed, routine anticipatory guidance was provided, the pediatrician administered vaccines and the research protocol was initiated. Fig.1 .Flow of the study procedure and outcome of the diagnosis from laboratory results.ID: Iron deficiency without anemia; hemoglobin concentration ≥ 10.5 g/dL21 and transferrin saturation < 16%6.IDA: Iron deficiency anemia; hemoglobin concentration < 10.5 g/dL21 and transferrin saturation < 16%6.Other anemia: Hemoglobin concentration < 10.5 g/dL21 and transferrin saturation ≥ 16%6.Normal: Hemoglobin concentration ≥ 10.5 g/dL21 and transferrin saturation ≥ 16%6.Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:23924 3 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-74151-8www.nature.com/scientificreports/ At the 4-month visit, caregivers were asked to complete the demographic data questionnaire.
The pediatrician in the clinic advocated starting with a serving of iron-rich complementary food per day once the participant reached 6 months of age and prescribed an oral iron supplement of 1 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in the form of ferrous sulfate (Fig. 1), which was adjusted at subsequent visits to account for the weight gain of the participants.Dietary guidance was provided on the appropriate types, amounts, and menus of iron-rich complementary foods for the respective age according to the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand17 suggesting at least 3 tablespoons of liver paste per week and the instructions for the administration of the iron medication were informed.The iron supplement was to be taken once daily while the infant’s stomach was empty and then refrain from eating food and milk for 1 h19.
Caregivers were asked to install the official LINE mobile phone application, which was used as a way of communication between caregivers and the primary investigator. It was a channel for caregivers to send food records after participants reached 6 months of age, and for the primary investigator to inform caregivers to stop the medication if the food record showed an adequate amount of participant iron intake.According to the Bureau of Nutrition, Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, the daily iron requirement is at least 9 mg20.At the 6-month visit, participants who continued to receive exclusive or partial breastfeeding would remain in the study.Partial breastfeeding was defined as consuming breast milk > 50% of daily total milk intake.Caregivers were asked to perform and send the monthly 7 consecutive day food record at age 6, 7, 8, and 9 months to the primary investigator.Caregivers who forgot to send the food record were reminded via the LINE mobile phone application.
The daily iron intake was then assessed using INMUCAL-nutrients V .4.0. Whenever the infants ingested adequate iron from their complementary food and formula ( ≥ 9 mg/day), their caregivers were contacted to stop taking the medication.At this visit, caregivers also received a questionnaire asking about iron medication administration, including the amount in milliliters per dose of the drug that the participant consumed; duration of medication administration before or after food, breast milk or formula (with milk, 30 min apart from food or milk, ≥ 1 h apart from food or milk); and side effects of the drug such as constipation, diarrhea, abdominal bloating.Correct administration of iron medication is defined as taking the medicine ≥ 1 h before or after food or milk.At the 9-month visit, participants received a CBC and iron study from peripheral venous blood.The iron study consisted of serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation.
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was diagnosed by hemoglobin concentration < 10.5 g/dL21 combined with transferrin saturation < 16%6. Iron deficiency without anemia (ID) was identified when transferrin saturation < 16%6 but hemoglobin concentration ≥ 10.5 g/dL21.Other anemia was described by hemoglobin concentration < 10.5 g/dL21 but transferrin saturation ≥ 16%6.Participants whose hemoglobin concentration ≥ 10.5 g/dL and transferrin saturation ≥ 16% would be classified as normal iron parameter and CBC and then suggested stopping the medication.Children identified with anemia would be investigated and treated as standard of care by the pediatrician in the clinic.Caregivers were asked to inform the type of milk the infants took at 9 months of age (breast milk, formula, or both breast milk and formula).
They were also asked about the average number of days per week that the participant took the medication from the fourth to ninth month (0, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7 days), and if caregivers reported stopping taking the medication, they were asked to state the reason. Drug compliance in this study was classified as good and poor.Good compliance was identified if the participant took the medication at least 5 days/week.The infant who took the medication < 5 days a week was defined as having poor compliance.The weight and length of the participant were measured.The body weight and supine length of the participants were measured in a single measurement to the nearest 0.1 kg, and 0.1 cm, respectively.Supine length was measured using an infantometer with a secure headboard, an adjustable footboard and a ruler attached to one side.Two nurses were required to complete this assessment.The weighing scale and infantometer were regularly calibrated.
According to the 2006 WHO child growth standard, weight for length of > 2SD was classified as overweight22. At this visit, the caregivers were fully funded for laboratory expenses.Outcomes The main results of this study were the number of participants who had IDA, an average daily amount in mg of iron intake from complementary foods and the formula of participants at 6, 7, 8, and 9 months of age calculated from INMUCAL, and the association between factors and iron deficiency at 9 months of age.Statistical analysis Statistical analyzes were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.Demographic data was analyzed using descriptive statistics.Categorical data were demonstrated as percentages.The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to test for normal distributed data.Mean and SD, and median and range were used to describe normal and non- normal continuous distributed data, respectively.
We used Pearson’s Chi-square test, Y ates’ continuity correction, or Fisher’s exact test to explore associations between caregiver education, occupation, income, number of siblings, sex of the infant, compliance with medication, adequate iron intake, proper intake of liver paste, correctness of ferrous medication administration, type of milk intake at 9 months and IDA and iron deficiency status. These tests were also used to investigate the association between exclusive breastfeeding at 9 months and the adequate iron intake, and between side effects of ferrous medications and compliance with medications.A monthly household income less than 571.44 USD was defined as low family income, while at least 571.44 USD was classified as high family income.Proper liver intake was defined as taking at least 3 tablespoons of liver paste per week.
Subsequently, independent variables with a p-value less than 0.1 in univariate binary logistic regression, and type of milk intake at 9 months were included in the multivariate binary logistic regression model to adjust the confounders to investigate the association between these independent variables and iron deficiency status. The adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:23924 4 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-74151-8www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (95% CI) was used to identify the magnitude and direction of their associations.All tests with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistical significance.Results Of the 75 exclusively breastfed infants invited to the study, 49 continued to participate in the study at 6 months of age (Fig.1).Of these 49, two were not tested for the iron study due to miscommunication.Therefore, 47 infants were included in the analysis.Demographic data are shown in Table 1.

At 9 months of age, 32 (68.1%) of caregivers continued breastfeeding without formula, 8 (17%) reported total formula feeding, and 7 (14.9%) provided breast milk and formula. Exclusive breastfeeding at 9 months of age was correlated with inadequate iron intake ( p = 0.001).There was no association between IDA and factors including iron and liver intake, compliance and correctness in iron medication administration, family income, as well as sex of the participants, the number of siblings, and the type of milk ingested at 9 months of age.This could be due to the small number ( n = 3) of participants who were diagnosed with IDA.Therefore, an additional analysis of the association between these factors and iron deficiency status was conducted (Table 3).The iron deficiency group consisted of all participants who had iron deficiency without anemia and those who had iron deficiency anemia.
The non-iron deficiency group consisted of those identified as other anemia and those classified as normal. The potential variables with p-value < 0.1, including type of milk intake at 9 months, were analyzed using multivariate binary logistic regression.The final analysis revealed that participants who were male (adjusted OR = 9.389, 95% CI 1.473–59.838, p = 0.018), and whose caregivers worked outside of home (adjusted OR = 6.388, 95% CI 1.019–40.035, p = 0.048) significantly increased the chance of iron deficiency status (Table 4).Medication side effects were reported in 27.3% (12/44) of the participants.These side effects included abdominal bloating ( n = 5), constipation ( n = 4), vomiting ( n = 2) and diarrhea ( n = 1).The presence of side effects was not associated with poor drug compliance ( p = 0.191).No caregiver stopped giving the medication without being instructed to do so.
Discussion The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants at 9 months of age after receiving iron supplementation since 4 months of age was 6.4%. Male sex and employed caregiver were significantly associated with an increased risk of iron deficiency status.The median daily iron intake increased from the 6th to the 9th month, but remained less than the Thai dietary reference recommendation.The prevalence of IDA was 6.4% in the present study and was less than the prevalence of IDA in EBF aged 9 months from the previous study in Thailand (25.7%)15 when no iron medication was provided.This high discrepancy could be due to the fact that this study used the updated WHO cut-off point for hemoglobin level for anemia in children under 2 years of age, which was less than 10.5 g/dL21, while the previous study used the former WHO cut-off point for hemoglobin level less than 11 g/dL15.
However, when the former cut-off point was applied in this study, the prevalence of IDA (12.8%) in EBF infants was still lower than the previous one (25.7%). Poor drug compliance (37.8% of participants) and incorrect administration of iron medications (40% of participants) could decrease the true effect of iron supplementation.However, this might reflect the real situation in clinical practice.Therefore, pediatricians should emphasize the importance of regularity and correctness in iron medication intake for caregivers when prescribing the medication.Iron deficiency without anemia in participants with exclusive breastfeeding was more prevalent than IDA (36.2% vs.6.4%).This was consistent with a previous study that found an overall 19.7% prevalence of iron deficiency without anemia in infants with exclusive breastfeeding compared to 7.9% with IDA23.To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the amount of iron intake in mg per day among Thai infants aged 6–9 months.
Although 51.1% of the participants could eat liver at least 3 tablespoons a week as recommended by the national recommendation (Table 1), and the amount of iron ingested increased with age (Table 2), quantitative measurement of iron intake of complementary foods and formula illustrated that almost all of these infants consumed insufficient iron for daily requirements (at least 9 mg/day; based on the iron requirement of the reference diet for Thais 202020). This finding suggests that the national recommendation of at least 3 tablespoons of liver paste a week may not be adequate for the iron source.Therefore, pediatricians should promote the National Child Health Supervision Guideline to start a daily serving of iron-rich complementary food once the child reaches 6 months of age and educate parents about the variety of iron-rich foods.
The finding that exclusive breastfeeding at 9 months was significantly associated with inadequate iron intake also emphasized the importance of iron medication supplementation in infants with exclusive breastfeeding to ensure sufficient iron intake, especially at 4–9 months of age or even longer. We found that male sex was significantly associated with iron deficiency ( p = 0.018) with an odd ratio of 9.389.This was consistent with a previous study that found that iron deficiency was significantly more common in male infants with the hypothesis that male infants could physiologically gain more muscle mass24 leading to a higher iron requirement.The finding that participants whose caregivers worked outside of the home were Age 6 months ( n = 41) 7 months ( n = 40) 8 months ( n = 38) 9 months ( n = 32) Median (range) of daily iron intake (mg) 0.5 (0.05,9.8) 1.04 (0.08,7.54) 1.89 (0.15,8.13) 2.34 (0.24,17.69) Daily iron intake ≥ 9 mg (n (%)) 1 (2.4) 0 (0) 0 (0) 4 (12.5) Table 2 .

Although participants with poor compliance with medications, that is, those taking iron medication < 5 days/week, were significantly associated with iron deficiency status ( p-value = 0.090), the statistical significance was not found after multivariate binary logistic regression analysis ( p = 0.124). This could be because the sample size was small and the compliance reported from caregiver recall may not be accurate.Therefore, regardless of the statistically insignificant association of multivariate binary logistic regression, we strongly believe that good compliance should be recommended to all children.Despite several side effects being reported, they were not associated with poor medication compliance, no caregiver decided to stop the medication before completing the study protocol, and 62.2% of the participants demonstrated good compliance.These findings also indicated the promising practicability of the family to administer this medication to their infants.
The strengths of the present study are that the diagnosis of IDA and iron deficiency status were specific. Transferrin saturation is a common and feasible iron parameter.The exact amount of iron in the diet of the participants was evaluated using a 7-day food record and INMUCAL Nutrient V .4.0 developed from the Thai Food and Recipe Database.The study could represent the real situation when the guideline was applied.We also acknowledge the limitations of the small sample size.A single-center study in Bangkok and the metropolitan area could not be generalizable to the general Thai population.The transferrin saturation level has a diurnal variation and fluctuation by meal26 where the circulating iron is high in the morning and in the 0–4 h postprandial period, so a different time to take the blood sample can interfere with this laboratory result26.
However, in the clinical setting, pediatricians do not require that infants who come for blood draws for the iron study be in a fasting state. Compliance with iron medication in this study was evaluated by caregiver reports and recalls once at the end of the intervention, which was less credible than regular reporting and directly measuring the amount of medicine left over by collecting the used, empty and unused medication bottles.Although the food record is the best way to obtain quantitative estimates of nutrient intake27, a more accurate estimate of food intake could be obtained from weight measurement or photographs of pre- and post- food and milk intake.However, these also reflect real-world clinical practice that leftover medication and evidence of food intake rarely be measured accurately.The birth history of delayed cord clamping, which could preserve neonatal iron storage and reduce the risk of iron deficiency anemia7, was not collected.
Although healthy full-term infants were recruited to reduce the likelihood of underlying anemia and chronic inflammation, no baseline studies of CBC and iron, including inflammatory markers, were performed before receiving the iron supplement. However, this was consistent with the WHO and AAP guidelines, where these baseline laboratory tests are not performed routinely prior to starting supplementation.Despite these limitations, this study provides preliminary data on inadequate iron intake in Thai infants, the prevalence of iron deficiency in EBF infants, and the need for iron supplementation for these infants.Pediatricians should emphasize to caregivers the importance of regular iron medication taking and correct iron administration, together with advocacy for the introduction of one serving of various iron-rich complementary foods a day once the child reaches 6 months of age.
Conclusion The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among 9-month-old exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants who received iron supplementation since 4 months was 6.4%. Most of the participants had inadequate iron intake at 9 months of age.The employed caregiver and the male sex of the infant increased the risk of iron deficiency.In infants with exclusive breastfeeding, iron supplementation should be recommended at 4 months of age until the child is able to eat sufficient iron-rich complementary foods.Larger multicenter studies are needed to develop Thai national guidelines for iron medication supplementation in EBF infants.Data availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Received: 16 May 2024; Accepted: 24 September 2024 References 1.Baker, R.D., Greer, F .R.& Committee on Nutrition American Academy of Pediatrics.
