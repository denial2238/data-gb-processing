Objective: We assessed the impact of mandatory wheat ﬂour fort iﬁcation on micronutr ient status in Yaound ´e and Douala, Cameroon. Methods: We conducted representative surveys 2 y before and 1 y after the introduction of fortiﬁed wheat ﬂour.In each survey, 10 households were selected within each of the same 30 clusters ( n=;300 households).Indicators of inﬂammation, malaria, anemia, and micronutrient status [plasma ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), zinc, folate,and vitamin B-12] were assessed among women aged 15–49 y and children 12–59 mo of age.Results: Wheat ﬂour was consumed in the past 7 d by $90% of participants.Postfortiﬁcation, mean total iron and zinc concentrations of ﬂour samples were 46.2 and 73.6 mg/kg (target added amounts were 60 and 95 mg/kg, respectively).Maternal anemia prevalence was signiﬁcantly lower postfortiﬁcation (46.7% compared with 39.1%; adjusted P=0 .0 1 ) ,b u t mean hemoglobin concentrations and child anemia prevalence d id not differ.
For both women and children postfortiﬁcation, mean plasma concentrations were greater for ferritin and lo wer for sTfR after adjustments for potential confounders. Mean plasma zinc concentrations were greater postfortiﬁcation and the prevalence of low plasma zinc concentration in women after fortiﬁcation (21%) was lower than before fortiﬁcation (39%, P< 0.001); likewise in children, the prevalence postfortiﬁcation (28%) was lower than prefortiﬁcation (47%, P< 0.001).Mean plasma total folate concentrations were ;250% greater postfortiﬁcation among women (47 compared with 15 nmol/L) and children (56 compared with 20 nmol/L), and the prevalence of low plasma folate values was <1% after fortiﬁcation in both population subgroups.In a nonrepresentative subset of plasma samples, folic acid was detected in 77% of women (73% of thos e fasting) and 93% of children.Mean plasma and breast-milk vitamin B-12 concentrations were >50% greater postfortiﬁcation.
Conclusion: Although the pre-post survey design limits causal inference, iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B-12 status increased among women and children in urban Cameroon after mandatory wheat ﬂour fortiﬁcation. JN u t r 2017;147:1426–36.Keywords: fortiﬁcation, effectiveness, iron, folate, vitamin B-12, zinc, breast milk Introduction Micronutrient deﬁciencies affect millions of people globally and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among vulnerable population groups (1).Fortiﬁcation of industrially processed staple foods is one promising strategy for reducing micronutrientdeﬁciencies and associated health consequences.
Yet, despite the widespread introduction of large-scale food fortiﬁcation pro- grams, few data are available on their effectiveness for improvingmicronutrient status among population groups at risk of deﬁ- ciency, such as women of reproductive age and young children.Information on program effectiveness is particularly scant for nutrients such as zinc, vitamin B-12, and, in low-income settings, folate. In 2009, before the implementation of mandatory large-scale wheat ﬂour fortiﬁcation in Cameroon, we conducted a national survey to establish the baseline prevalence of micronutrient deﬁciencies and to collect information on dietary patterns to inform the development of a food fortiﬁcation program (2, 3).In response to evidence that micronutrient deﬁciencies were a public health problem, the government of Cameroon instituted 1426 Manuscript received December 28, 2016.Initial review completed January 31, 2017.Revision accepted May 3, 2017.
First published online June 7, 2017; doi: https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.116.245076. a mandatory food fortiﬁcation program, launched in August 2011.The program includes the addition of vitamin A to reﬁned vegetable oil (40 IU/g as retinyl palmitate) and the addition of iron (60 mg Fe/kg as ferrous fumarate), zinc (95 mg Zn/kg aszinc oxide), folic acid (5.0 mg/kg), and vitamin B-12 (0.04 mg/kg) to wheat ﬂour.In 2012, we conducted a survey in Yaound ´e and Douala, the 2 major metropolitan areas of Cameroon, to evaluate the impact of the fortiﬁcation program 1 y after the introduc- tion of fortiﬁed food products.
The objectives of the presentanalyses were as follows: 1) to determine the availability of adequately fortiﬁed wheat ﬂour in households and markets, 2) to evaluate the change in indic ators of micronutrient status (iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B-12) from 2009 to 2012(i.e., 2 y before and 1 y after the introduction of fortiﬁed wheat ﬂour), and 3) to assess whether the consumption of wheat ﬂour postfortiﬁcation was related to indicators of micronutrientstatus. Methods Study design and sampling.This analysis included data from 2 cross- sectional, cluster surveys conducted in 2009 and 2012, which were completed in the same season (4, 5).The baseline survey was conducted in September–December 2009 and was representative nationally andat the level of each of 3 survey strata, including 1 stratum representing Yaound ´e and Douala (together comprising ;20% of the total popu- lation) (2, 4).
Thirty clusters per stratum were selected by usingproportionate-to-population size sampling; only results from the urbanstratum (Yaound ´e and Douala; 15 clusters/city) are included in the present analysis because the evaluation survey was conducted only in Yaound ´e and Douala. The evaluation survey was conducted in October–November 2012 and included the same 30 clusters in Yaound ´e and Douala that were sampled in the 2009 survey (5).Sampling within each cluster was conducted by identifying a random start point and systematic sampling of adjacent households.The 2 surveys used identicalmethods to sample households within each cluster, but individualparticipants likely differed because the random start points were different for each survey.For both surveys, the target sample size was 10 households (i.e., 10 women and 10 children)/cluster.Data collection took place 2 d after recruitment; thus, 12–15 households/cluster were selected in anticipation of an attrition rate of 15–30%.
In addition to the 10 households thatparticipated in the full study, we recruited an additional 2–3 lactatingwomen/cluster to provide breast-milk samples only to obtain the target of 5 milk samples/cluster. The sample size was based on expected change in mean biomarker concentrations after food fortiﬁcation (effect sizesranging from 0.2 to 0.5) and assuming a design effect of 2 (although inthe urban stratum selected for this pre-post comparison, the estimated design effects were generally <2).Participant eligibility and consent.Households were eligible to participate if there was $1 child 12–59 mo of age and 1 woman of reproductive age (15–49 y) who was the child /C213s primary caregiver.Children and women were eligible to participate if they had lived in thehousehold for $1 mo and did not have reported severe fever, diarrhea with dehydration, or other severe illness at recruitment or betweenrecruitment and data collection (i.e., during the 72 h before datacollection).
Caregivers were eligible to provide a breast-milk sample ifthe breastfeeding child was $1 mo of age, regardless of whether the lactating woman or breastfeeding child was selected to participate in the full survey. Women provided informed oral consent for themselves and the child to participate, with permission from the head of household whereappropriate.The 2009 survey was approved by the National Ethics Committee of Cameroon and the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Davis.In 2012, the National Ethics Com-mittee had suspended activity during a period of reorganization; thus,approval was obtained from the Cameroon Ministry of Public Health and the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Davis.Data collection.Bilingual (French and English) interviewers adminis- tered questionnaires to collect information on household demographicand socioeconomic characteristics.
These included housing material,type of toilet, type of fuel for cooking and light, household water source and location, a possessions index, animal ownership, and the education, occupation, and employment status of the index woman and head ofhousehold. Information on the consumption of selected ‘‘fortiﬁable’’foods, including wheat ﬂour, was collected by using an FFQ, which inquired about different preparations (e.g., wheat ﬂour in bread or beignet) (2).Respondents were asked how many days during theprevious 7 d that they (or the index child) had consumed each food and the number of the times they consumed the food on the last day on which the food was consumed.In 2009 only, 24-h dietary recall interviews(with replicates in a subset of ;10% on a nonconsecutive day) were conducted to quantify total nutrient intakes of women and children.Details of the dietary data collection methods were reported previously (2, 3, 6).
Venous blood (5–7 mL) was collected into trace element–free tubes containing lithium heparin (Sarsted t). International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG) recommendations for the collection and processing of samples for plasma zinc measurement were followed(7).Blood collection and storage co ntainers were covered in foil to prevent degradation of light-sensitive analytes.Blood samples were placed immediately in a cooler with ice packs and centrifuged within 2 h to separate plasma (10 min at 2500 3gat room temperature).Plasma samples were placed in aliquots within an opaque, portable dead-air box to minimize exposure to light and dust during sample handling.In 2012 only, an additional 1–2 mL of blood was collected into tubes containing EDTA (Sarstedt) for the measurement of hemo- globin and malaria infection in whole blood.
For both surveys, hemoglobin was measured in venous blood by using a portablephotometer (Hemocue 201+), except for some children from whoma capillary sample was obtained (estimated to be <10%). In 2009, current or recent malaria infection was determined by measuring plasma histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) concentrations (8).In 2012,malaria was assessed in whole blood by using a rapid diagnostic test (SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pan; Standard Diagnostics Inc.); individ- uals with positive rapid diagnostic tests results were treated(Coartem; Novartis Pharmaceuticals) and referred to the nearesthealth clinic.In both surveys, breast-milk samples were collected by the casual sampling method described previously (9).The mother was asked to feedher child from the fuller breast.After 30 s, the mother transferred theinfant to the other breast and manually expressed 5–10 mL of milk from the ﬁrst breast.
Milk-fat concentration was measured in triplicate immediately after collection by using the Creamatocrit method (10), andthe remaining milk sample was remixed and aliquots were placed into storage vials wrapped in foil.

When available, ;10 g wheat ﬂour was collected into sterile, plastic containers covered in foil. Because few households(n= 25;;8%) had wheat ﬂour at home (most consumed wheat ﬂour as purchased bread or beignets), we also obtained ﬂour samples at nearby markets.The ﬁeld team attempted to locate the vendor indicated by therespondent(s) where possible; otherwise, the nearest available vendorwas selected.Samples were obtained by requesting a sample of ;10 g from a large sack or by purchasing a small sack and retaining asubsample of ;10 g (after thorough mixing).Aliquots of plasma, breast milk, and wheat ﬂour were stored in a cooler with ice packs until the end of the day, when they were transferred to a freezer (with backup generator) for storage at #220/C176C until shipping on dry ice for laboratory analyses.
Plasma indicators of inﬂammation [C-reactive protein (CRP) and a 1- acid glycoprotein (AGP)] and iron [ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)] status were measured by ELISA (11). Plasma HRP2 was measured by using a commercial kit (Malaria Ag CELISA; Cellabs) (8), and samples with absorbance of $0.1 were considered positive.Plasma zinc and wheat ﬂour zinc and iron were measured by inductively coupledplasma atomic emission spectrometry (12).Method performance char-acteristics, including assay precision and limits of detection and accuracyfor select indicators, are presented in Supplemental Table 1 .Due to resource constraints, plasma folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations before fortiﬁcati on were initially measured in a ran- domly selected subset of 50% of households (13).To increase thesample size for the pre-post comparison, the remaining 50% ofbaseline samples in Yaound ´e and Douala were analyzed, in addition to the full set of postfortiﬁcation samples.
Plasma folate and vitamin B-12 were measured by using the Simultrac-SNB RIA vitamin B-12 [ 57Co]/folate [125I] (MP Biomedicals) (13). Breast-milk vitamin B-12 concentration was measured by Immulite/Immulite 1000 VitaminB-12 competitive chemiluminescen ce enzyme immunoassay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic) (14).To further explore the forms of folate present in plasma, all postfortiﬁcation samples for which sufﬁcient remaining plasma was available ( n= 151 women, n= 124 children) were analyzed by isotope dilution LC–tandem MS (isotope dilution LC-MS/MS) based on themethod of Fazili et al.(15) (Supplemental Table 1).For unmetabolizedfolic acid (UFA), values below the limit of detection (LOD; 14% overall)were replaced with a small nonzero value calculated as the square root ofthe LOD (2).For tetrahydrofolate (THF) and 5-formylTHF , values below the LOD ( ;96% and ;81%, respectively) were replaced with 0.
MeFox (pyrazino-s-triazine derivative of 4 a-hydroxy-5-methylTHF) and 5-methylTHF were detected in all samples. For the analyses offorms of folate, some clusters were not represented due to insufﬁcientremaining plasma samples, so the population sample was not statisticallyrepresentative.Women with and without sufﬁcient plasma for LC-MS/MS analyses had similar plasma total folate concentrations, asmeasured by RIA (45.9 compared with 47.8 nmol/L, respectively, among n= 287 women with RIA measurements; P= 0.99).For children, individuals with sufﬁcient plasma remaining had 13% greater meanplasma folate concentrations compared with children without remainingplasma (59.9 compared with 53.1 nmol/L, respectively, among n= 285 children with RIA measurements; P= 0.03).Thus, the results for folate metabolites may overestimate the values for the original populationsample.
Total folate concentrations measured by the 2 methods were strongly correlated ( r s= 0.75 for women, rs= 0.62 for children; P< 0.0001). Among the subset of women with both measures ( n= 142), the unweighted mean (95% CI) for the RIA values was 45.9 nmol/L (42.7,49.1 nmol/L) and the mean for LC-MS/MS values was 42.2 nmol/L(38.7, 45.6 nmol/L).The corresponding values for children ( n= 121) were 59.9 nmol/L (55.2, 64.6 nmol/L) and 52.0 nmol/L (48.4, 55.6 nmol/L), respectively.Thus, we present RIA values for plasma total folate andLC-MS/MS values for folate metabolites.Statistical analysis.Data were analyzed by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.).The SAS survey procedures were used to obtainappropriate variance estimates.Weighting factors were applied to account for the respective population sizes of Yaound ´e and Douala and to adjust for nonresponse within each cluster.
For each survey,variables relating to socioeconomic status (described above) were combined by using factor analysis to create a continuous score: the eigenvalues were 4.36 (64% of variance) for the national baseline surveyand 1.99 (38% of variance) for the postfortiﬁcation survey in Yaound ´e and Douala. We calculated the frequency of consumption of wheat ﬂour in the past 7 d, excluding pasta, which is not included in the fortiﬁcation program.Detailed descriptions of the analytical methods for the 24-hdietary recall data have been reported elsewhere (3, 6).We applied aregression equation to estimate absorbable zinc for women (16) andEstimated Average Requirement (EAR) values from the IZiNCG (7) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (17).Iron bioavailability was assumed to be 10% in this urban setting, and we estimated vitamin B-12absorption as described previously (13).
The National Cancer Institutemethod was used to estimate usual nutrient intake distributions (18).The prevalence of inadequate intake was estimated by the EAR cutoff method, with the exception of iron, for which the full probability method was used in combination with estimated physiologic require-ments (17). EAR values for folate and vitamin B-12 were from the USIOM (19).We then simulated the effects of wheat ﬂour fortiﬁcation onthe adequacy of micronutrient intakes, as described previously (3), underthe assumption that all wheat ﬂour contained added micronutrients at 75% of the target fortiﬁcation levels (i.e., additional 45 mg Fe/kg, 71.25 mg Zn/kg, 3.75 mg folic acid/kg, and 0.03 mg vitamin B-12/kg; thisassumption was based on the measured iron and zinc contents of the ﬂoursamples, but is more optimistic because we modeled added micronutrientcontent, whereas the measured values refer to total iron and zinc).
To report mean ferritin and zinc concentrations and the prevalence of deﬁciency, concentrations of these indicators were adjusted for inﬂam- mation by using regression analysis (20). Brieﬂy, for each biomarker andpopulation group (women and children), a linear regression model was developed to describe the relation between the biomarker and CRP and AGP , including interactions or quadratic terms that were signiﬁcant.These equations were then used to adjust individual values to concen-trations equivalent to those in the absence of inﬂammation, deﬁned asCRP and AGP <0.12 mg/L and <0.57 g/L for children and <0.16 mg/L and <0.47 g/L for women, respectively (values representing the 10th percentile of individuals in the survey with CRP <5 mg/L and AGP<1 g/L).Body iron stores (BIS) were estimated from sTfR and adjustedferritin concentrations (21).
Cutoffs for biochemical values were as follows—anemia: hemoglo- bin <110 g/L (children and pregnant women) and <120 g/L (nonpregnant women); iron deﬁciency: inﬂammation-adjusted plasma ferritin concen-trations <12 mg/L (children) or <15 mg/L (women), sTfR >8.3 mg/L, or BIS <0 mg/kg; low plasma zinc: <65 mg/dL (morning; children), <57mg/dL (afternoon; children), <50 mg/dL (pregnant women), <70 mg/dL (morning; fasting women), <66 mg/dL (morning; nonfasting women), and <59mg/dL (afternoon; women) (7); low plasma folate: <7 or <10 nmol/L (women or children) (22); insufﬁcient vitamin B-12 status: plasma vitaminB-12 <221 pmol/L; and moderate vitamin B-12 deﬁciency: plasma vitaminB-12 <148 pmol/L(23). Differences in micronutrient status and other indicators by survey were examined by using SAS survey regression procedures, with a binary variable representing survey year.
The outcomevariables were unadjusted biomarker concentrations or the proportionof low values, and analyses were conducted with and without controllingfor potential covariates. Comparisons with P<0 .0 5w e r ec o n s i d e r e d signiﬁcant.Propensity scores are one method to control for confounding in the relation between fortiﬁed food intake and micronutrient status, with the advantage of reducing the number of covariates in the model (24).Tocontrol for differences in propensity to consume fortiﬁed products frequently, we created propensity scores for the frequent consumption of wheat ﬂour with the use of logistic regression.We deﬁned frequentconsumption as $14 times/wk, which is approximately the 75th percentile of consumption.Predictors included stratum (city) andvariables related to socioeconomic status as described above, with the exception of the possessions index and animal ownership.1428 Engle-Stone et al.
For the adjusted analyses, potential covariates included the follow- ing: age; residence in Yaound ´e or Douala; frequency of wheat ﬂour intake; household socioeconomic status (continuous score); CRP and AGP (both continuous); current or recent malaria; type of toilet (as a proxy for infection risk); propensity to consume wheat ﬂour$14 times/wk; time of day of blood collection, time elapsed between previous meal and blood collection, and time from blood collection to centrifugation (zinc only); breastfeeding status (children); pregnancy or lactation; BMI (women); and breast-milk fat concentration (milkvitamin B-12 only). Quadratic terms were evaluated where the relationbetween the covariate and outcome did not appear linear, and selected interactions with CRP , AGP, and child age were included.
All covariates and selected interaction terms were then added to theregression model, and covariates were sequentially removed if they were not signiﬁcantly associated with the outcome ( P> 0.05, P>0 . 1 for interactions).If removal of a c ovariate changed the regression coefﬁcient of the ‘‘survey year’’ variable by >20% or changed thesigniﬁcance of the Pvalue, the covariate was retained in the model.Age was retained in all models.Regression diagnostics (including residuals, leverage, and tolerance) were assessed for the ‘‘full’’ (all covariates) and ﬁnal models.Finally, we conducted several plausibility analyses to assess whether any observed change over time was related to the consumption of fortiﬁed foods.First, with the use of 2012 data only, we examined therelations between micronutrient status indicators and the frequency of wheat ﬂour consumption by using Spearman correlations ( r s).
Second, to better assess whether the relation between wheat ﬂour intake andmicronutrient status differed pre- and postfortiﬁcation, we used regres-sion analysis to model this relation as the interaction between survey year and frequency of consumption of wheat ﬂour in models predictingmicronutrient status. This was an exploratory analysis, because we did not base the sample size on that required to detect interactions.Results Recruitment procedures and parti cipant characteristics, in- cluding micronutrient status and dietary intake in the 2009survey, have been reported elsewhere (2, 4, 5).In general, participants in the 2 surveys were similar, but women and children in the postfortiﬁcation survey were older (29.1c o m p a r e dw i t h2 7 .1yf o rw o m e n ,3 2 .8c o m p a r e dw i t h3 0 .3m ofor children; P< 0.05) and women had higher mean CRP concentrations postfortiﬁcati on (3.5 compared with 2.7 mg/L; P= 0.0002) ( Table 1 ).
Among wheat ﬂour samples collected ( n= 38), 76% were considered fortiﬁed ( $14 mg Fe/kg and $13 mg Zn/kg) and mean iron and zinc contents of fortiﬁed samples (57 mg totalFe/kg; 94 mg total Zn/kg) were close to mandated amounts (60 mg added Fe/kg; 95 mg added Zn/kg) ( Table 2 ). Only 34% of samples had total Fe $60 mg/kg and total Zn $95 mg/kg.To assess whether the mineral results might serve as a reasonable proxy for B-vitamin content, we selected a single ‘‘fortiﬁed’’ sample (54.9 mg Fe/kg, 93.6 mg Zn/kg) and a single ‘‘unforti-ﬁed’’ sample (12.0 mg Fe/kg, 6.2 mg Zn/kg) for B-vitaminanalysis.The fortiﬁed sample contained 2.84 mg folic acid/kg and 0.038 mg vitamin B-12/kg (compared with the targets of 5 mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively), whereas the unfortiﬁedsample contained 0.11 mg folic acid/kg and <0.001 mg vitamin B-12/kg.More than 90% of respondents reported consuming wheat ﬂour in the past week, with an average frequency of 1–2 times/d (Table 3 ).
The median and 75th percentile of usual ﬂour intakes among all nonbreastfeeding children in this region (>90% ofchildren aged 12–59 mo) were 31 and 66 g/d, respectively. Forwomen, the median and 75th percentile of usual ﬂour intakes were 24 and 79 g/d (estimates included wheat ﬂour consumers and ‘‘nonconsumers’’).Dietary modeling predicted that wheatﬂour fortiﬁcation at 75% of the target levels would result in large decreases in the prevalence of inadequate folate intakes and more moderate decreases in the prevalence of inadequateiron and vitamin B-12 intakes.For women, the predicted effect of zinc fortiﬁcation varied according to the EAR [e.g., IZiNCG (7) and IOM (17)] and the assumptions about absorption, anddecreased in all cases (Table 3).
Among nonbreastfeeding children, the mean usual total zinc intake was predicted toTABLE 1 Characteristics of women and children who participated in the baseline and postfortiﬁcation surveys inYaound ´e and Douala, Cameroon 1 Baseline (2009)Postfortification (2012) P n Value n Value Women Age, y 279 27.1 60.4 302 29.1 60.4 0.002 Pregnant, % 214 11 293 16 0.07 Lactating, % 228 26 302 28 0.71 CRP , mg/L 273 2.67 60.22 305 3.52 60.37 0.0002 AGP , g/L 273 0.73 60.01 305 0.72 60.01 0.070 Inflammation, % 273 18 305 22 0.19 Malaria, % 261 7 299 5 0.30 Children Age, y 272 30.3 61.0 303 32.9 60.8 0.039 Male sex, % 288 49 308 50 0.86HAZ 255 20.6860.07 300 20.6360.07 0.62 Stunted (HAZ ,22), % 255 13.0 300 15.6 0.29 WAZ 255 20.1260.05 300 20.0660.06 0.47 Underweight (WAZ ,22), % 255 1.4 300 5.7 0.027 WHZ 255 0.36 60.05 300 0.42 60.07 0.46 Wasted (WHZ ,22), % 255 1.0 300 1.4 0.74 Breastfeeding, % 239 5 281 4 0.69CRP , mg/L 254 4.20 60.33 297 4.49 60.45 0.58 AGP , g/L 254 0.90 60.02 297 0.97 60.02 0.12 Inflammation, % 254 38 297 46 0.10Malaria, % 234 13 294 8 0.088 1Values are means 6SEs unless otherwise indicated.

Overall median values were 40.8 mg Fe/kg and 83.5 mg Zn/kg.Mandated fortiﬁcation levels are 60 mg Fe/kg and 95 mg Zn/kg. Flour fortiﬁcation and micronutrient status 1429 increase from 3.6 to 7.5 mg/d, but with no change in the prevalence of intakes below the EAR (16% with total zinc intake <2 mg/d).In Yaound ´e and Douala before fortiﬁcation, almost half of women and children were anemic, and deﬁciencies in iron and zinc were common ( Tables 4 and 5).Low plasma folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations were less common but still present,particularly for folate among women.Postfortiﬁcation, mean maternal hemoglobin concentrations did not differ from prefortiﬁcation values (adjusted P= 0.078); however, the prevalence of anemia was signiﬁcantly lower postfortiﬁcation (39.1% compared with 46.7%; P= 0.06, unadjusted; P= 0.01, adjusted for age, pregnancy, malaria, and inﬂammatory markers; Table 4).
There were no differences bysurvey year in hemoglobin concentration or anemia prevalence among children, with or without controlling for covariates (Table 5). Among women, mean estimated BIS and plasma concentra- tions of ferritin were greater and sTfR concentrations were lower after fortiﬁcation, with and without controlling for age,pregnancy, malaria, and inﬂammation.Postfortiﬁcation, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency, as measured by BIS and sTfR, was lower, but the prevalences of low plasma ferritin and irondeﬁciency anemia (deﬁned as low inﬂammation-adjusted plasma ferritin concentrations and anemia) did not differ.Amongchildren, all indicators suggested increased iron status, with and without controlling for inﬂammation, malaria, age, and other potential confounders, but the prevalence of iron deﬁciency anemia did not differ between surveys.
Compared with 2009, mean plasma zinc concentrations in 2012 were greater and the prevalence of low values was lower for both women and children. These differencespersisted after adjusting for age , breastfeeding status (chil- dren), pregnancy (women), malaria, inﬂammation, household characteristics, and variables related to the timing of bloodsampling.Mean plasma folate concentrations were almost 300% greater among women (47 compared with 15 nmol/L) andchildren (56 compared with 20 nmol/L) in 2012 compared withthose in 2009, and the prevalence of low plasma folate values was reduced to <1% (Tables 4 and 5).Similarly, mean plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations were >50% greater among bothwomen and children in 2012 compared with 2009, and mean breast-milk vitamin B-12 concentrations doubled (Table 4).These differences were signiﬁcant with and without adjusting forcovariates.
Among postfortiﬁcation samples with sufﬁcient remaining plasma for the measurement of folate forms, 5-methylTHF andMeFox contributed the largest proportion to total folateconcentrations ( Table 6 ).

Simulations assume wheat ﬂour fortiﬁcation at 75% of the target value (45 mg Fe/kg, 71.3 mg Zn/kg, 3.75 mg folic acid/kg, and 0.03 mg vitamin B-12/kg). Estimates of dietary adequacy are presented only among nonbreastfed children because breast-milk intake was not quantiﬁed.The prevalence of inadequate intakes was estimated by using theEAR cutoff method, except for iron, for which the probability method was used, assuming 10% absorption (17).The EAR for total zinc was6 mg/d for women (moderate bioavailability) and 2 mg/d for children (low-to-moderate bioavailability) (7); phytate-to-zinc molar ratios were12–14.Absorbable zinc was estimated for women according to Miller et al.(16); EAR values from the IZiNCG (7) and the IOM (17) wereapplied.Folic acid was converted to DFEs by multiplying by 1.67.
Adjusted vitamin B-12 intake was calculated as follows: for each serving of food that included .3mg vitamin B-12, the amount of vitamin B-12 was divided by 5 to adjust for lower absorption from higher doses (13). EAR values for folate were 320 mg DFEs/d for women and 120 mg DFEs/d for children; EAR values for vitamin B-12 were 2.0 mg/d for women and 0.7 mg/d for children (19).DFE, Dietary Folate Equivalent; EAR, Estimated Average Requirement; IOM, Institute of Medicine; IZiNCG, International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group.2Different from the prefortiﬁcation value, P,0.05.3Mean wheat ﬂour consumption on the previous day among consumers estimated without adjustment for intraindividual variation.Mean usual wheat ﬂour consumption was estimated by the National Cancer Institute method, as described in the text.Estimates for children excluded breastfeeding children.

Overall, UFA concentrations were positively associated with higher plasma total folate as measured by LC-MS/MS ( r s=0 . 5 0f o rw o m e na n d rs= 0.51 for children, P< 0.001).

Values for the 2 surveys were compared by using ‘‘unadjusted iron deﬁciency and anemia’’ as the dependent variable,with and without including CRP, AGP, their interaction, and other covariates.

Correlations between ﬂour intake frequency and indicatorsof iron and zinc status were not signiﬁcant among women or children. The frequency of ﬂour consumption was positively correlated with hemoglobin among children ( r s= 0.12, P= 0.04) but not among women ( rs= 0.02, P= 0.70).In linear regression models, there was a signiﬁcant inter- action between survey year and the frequency of ﬂour intakein predicting plasma vitamin B -12 concentrations in women (P= 0.025) and a marginal interaction in children ( P= 0.063).
Speciﬁcally, in 2009, there was no relation between wheatﬂour consumption and plasma vitamin B-12, but in 2012there was a positive relation between these variables ( Figure 1 ).In addition, there was a signiﬁcant interaction for breast-milk vitamin B-12 concentrations ( P= 0.03) in which there was no relation between ﬂour intake frequency and breast-milk vitamin B-12 at baseline ( n= 23) and a negative relation between breast-milk vitamin B-12 and ﬂour intake in 2012(n= 113). For all other micronutrient indicators, interactions between survey year and the frequency of wheat ﬂour intake were not signiﬁcant.Discussion Before fortiﬁcation, multiple micronutrient deﬁciencies werepresent among both women and children in this urban setting.Wheat ﬂour consumption was common and frequent.

The prevalence of inﬂammation-adjusted iron deﬁciency and anemia differed by survey(P=0 . 0 3 6 ) .6Low plasma zinc was deﬁned as ,65mg/dL for morning samples and ,57mg/dL for afternoon samples (7).To compare the prevalence of low plasma zinc, a single cutoff of ,65mg/dL was used, and time of day of blood collection was included as a covariate.1432 Engle-Stone et al.ﬂour samples collected from households and markets were designated as fortiﬁed, and the mean amounts of minerals infortiﬁed samples were close to the mandated amounts.Nutri- tional status for all micronutrients added to the wheat ﬂour was greater among both women and children postfortiﬁcation.Particularly large differences were observed in indicators of folate and vitamin B-12 status.
The positive relation between ﬂour consumption and vitamin B-12 biomarkers postfortiﬁca-tion, but not prefortiﬁcation, suggested that the change in statuswas related to the consumption of fortiﬁed ﬂour, although this relation was not observed for other nutrients. In addition, hemoglobin concentrations were slightly greater postfortiﬁca-tion among women, but not children, after controlling for malaria, inﬂammation, and other covariates.Although unrelated to the primary objectives of this analysis, we observed a signiﬁcantly greater prevalence of underweight, but not wasting, among children in the postfortiﬁcation survey, which remained signiﬁcant after controlling for child age.TheDemographic and Health Survey for Cameroon reported asimilar prevalence of underweight among children aged 6–59 mo in Yaound ´e and Douala in 2004 (3.8%) and 2011 (3.4%) (25), so our ﬁnding may be an anomaly, although this should beconﬁrmed.
In the national baseline survey, we observed regional differ- ences in micronutrient deﬁciency prevalence and consumption offortiﬁable foods, which have implications for program effec- tiveness (2). Micronutrient deﬁciencies were generally more common in the South and North strata than in Yaound ´e and Douala, with the exception of folate intake and status, which were lowest in Yaound ´e and Douala (2, 13).Wheat ﬂour products were consumed in greater amounts in Yaound ´e and Douala than in the 2 other strata (2).The wheat ﬂour fortiﬁcation levels in Cameroon correspond to a mean wheat ﬂour intake of <75 g/d according to WHO recommendations (26), which was consistent with ﬂour consumptio n nationally among consumers and nonconsumers combined.Ho wever, the mean ﬂour consump- tion among women who consumed ﬂour on the previous day, particularly in Yaound ´e and Douala, was in the range of 75– 149 g/d, which would correspond to lower fortiﬁcation levels for all nutrients except for iron.
Thus, t he program would be expected to contribute the most additional micronutrients to diets in the urbanareas, but the impact on deﬁciency p revalence is potentially greater in other regions of Cameroon.Several limitations of this st udy relate to data availability.

The pre-post design limits our ability to attribute changes in micronutrient status to the fortiﬁcation program,because it is possible that unmeasured factors contributed to the observed differences. However, the biochemical measures were conducted in the same laboratories with the use of the samemethods (with the exception of malaria), minimizing interlabor- atory variation.Statistically controlling for important potential confounders did not explain the greater micronutrient status in2012 than in 2009.Postfortiﬁcation, wheat ﬂour intake was positively associ- ated with maternal plasma folate and with plasma vitamin B-12 among women and children.However, such a relation isinsufﬁcient to assess whether cha nges in micronutrient status are attributable to a fortiﬁcation program because we previ- ously observed correlations b etween micronutrient bio- markers and fortiﬁable food in take before fortiﬁcation, likely due to underlying factors such as socioeconomic status (2).
The availability of baselin e data permitted examination of potential changes in the relatio n between fortiﬁed food intake and micronutrient status postfo rtiﬁcation, although we had limited statistical power to detect interactions and the measure of dietary intake available at both time points(frequency of consumption of selected foods) limited the scope and precision of plausibili ty analyses. Nevertheless, the observed relations between plasma vitamin B-12 and ﬂourintake in different survey years are consistent with a dose- response relation between ﬂour intake and vitamin B-12 status that appeared only after f ortiﬁcation.The interaction between milk vitamin B-12 and ﬂour consumption appears to be inconsistent but is difﬁcult to interpret due to the small baseline sample size.A number of studies have documented decreases in the prevalence of anemia and iron deﬁciency among women and children after fortiﬁcation with appropriate forms of iron (27).
In contrast, there is less evidence for the effectiveness of zincfortiﬁcation. A recent review concluded that zinc added alone to foods may increase serum zinc, but zinc added with other micronutrients may have no effect on serum zinc (28).Incontrolled efﬁcacy studies, plasma zinc did not respond to the consumption of zinc-fortiﬁed foods after 6 mo among children 6–8 mo of age in Peru (3 mg Zn/d) (29) and after 4 wk amongmen$18 y of age in Senegal (7.5 or 15 mg Zn/d) (30).However, serum zinc concentrations were greater after 24 and 36 mo among women in rural China whose families received wheatﬂour fortiﬁed with zinc and other nutrients than in women whoreceived unfortiﬁed wheat ﬂour (31).It is possible that the longer durations of the study in China and the present study contrib- uted to the difference in results.The apparent large increases in plasma folate concentra- tions are similar in magnitude to those observed in other settings in which folic acid fortiﬁcation was implemented.
Forexample, in the United States, serum folate concentrations among women increased >2-fold and the prevalence of low serum folate decreased fr om 21% to <1% between the NHANES 1988–1994 (before fortiﬁcation) and the NHANES2003–2004 (32); the fortiﬁcation level was lower (1.4 mg/g) but enriched grain intakes were presumably higher. Furthermore, mean serum total folate as measured by LC-MS/MS amongsupplement nonuser children 1–5 y of age (51.3 nmol/L) fromthe NHANES 2007–2008 survey period was comparable to that among children (52.9 nmol/L) in the present study.Moreover, UFA was detected in nearly all US serum samples from NHANES 2007–2008, regardle ss of fasting status (33); the authors suggested that higher concentrations of UFA in circulation may indicate that di etary intake exceeds require- ments.Thus, the higher UFA c oncentrations observed in the current study may indicate that the folic acid fortiﬁcation level is higher than necessary for thes e cities.
The effects in other regions of Cameroon, where ﬂour intake was lower, areunknown; these data are urgently needed to inform adjust- ments to the program at the national level. Few countries have large-scale vitamin B-12 fortiﬁcation programs, and to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst evaluation of theeffectiveness of large-scale ﬂour fortiﬁcation on vitamin B-12 status.The results suggest that vitamin B-12 fortiﬁcation may have a large impact on vitamin B-12 status where wheat ﬂour is frequentlyconsumed.Furthermo re, the greater milk vitamin B-12 concentra- tions that we observed postfortiﬁ cation surpassed the effects observed in supplementation studies (34), which could be relatedto greater vitamin B-12 absorption from small frequent doses than from larger, less frequent supplemental doses.
In summary, we observed greater iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B-12 status and a lower prevalence of deﬁciencies ofthese micronutrients among women of reproductive age and children aged 12–59 mo in urban Cameroon, and a slightly lower prevalence of anemia among women, 1 y after the intro-duction of mandatory wheat ﬂour fortiﬁcation with micronu- trients. Although the pre-post survey design limits inferences about causality, the available data suggest that the observedchanges can be attributed to the fortiﬁcation program.Program managers interested in using a similar approach to track changes in micronutrient status over time may wish to forego the com-plexity of statistical plausibility analyses, but would need to invest similar effort in the careful measurement of biomarkers to ensure that investments result in programs that are safeand effective.
Although young children are often assumed toconsume insufﬁcient quantities of staple foods to be affected by large-scale fortiﬁcation, our results suggest that young children should not be ignored as potential beneﬁciaries [as observedelsewhere (35)], although the programs are unlikely to fully meet the needs for all nutrients, particularly minerals. The apparent lack of effect on child anemia prevalence suggests that otherinterventions to address ane mia among children may be needed.Analysis of wheat ﬂour samples indicated that only ;75% of samples were fortiﬁed, indicating the need to strengthen efforts to monitor th e quality of fortiﬁed products and to enforce the norms adopted by the government.The high plasma folate and UFA co ncentrations suggest that the current fortiﬁcation levels are greater than needed in these cities.
The program should be evaluated in other regions of Cameroon where deﬁciencies in most micronutrients (and thus potential to beneﬁt from fortiﬁcation) were greatest,to inform adjustments to program design at the national level.
