Research Article The Troubling Rise of Scurvy: A Review and National Analysis of Incidence, Associated Risk Factors, andClinical Manifestations ABSTRACT Introduction: In the era of modern medicine, scurvy has been thought of as a rare disease of ancient times because of improved emphasis ondiet and nutrition; however, isolated case reports are plentiful.Thisinvestigation presents a comprehensive review of scurvy, including ananalysis on its rising incidence, with specific focus on its orthopaedic manifestations and commonly associated diagnoses.Methods: This comprehensive review includes a retrospective analysis of 19,413,465 pediatric patients in the National InpatientSample database from 2016 through 2020.Patients with scurvywere identified by the ICD-10 code, and an estimated incidence ofscurvy in the inpatient pediatric population was calculated.Concurrent diagnoses, musculoskeletal reports, and demographic variables were collected from patient records.
Comparisons weremade using analysis of variance or chi-square with Kendall tau,where appropriate.Results: The incidence of scurvy increased over the study period, from 8.2 per 100,000 in 2016 to 26.7 per 100,000 in 2020. Patients with scurvy were more likely to be younger ( P,0.001), male ( P= 0.010), in the lowest income quartile ( P= 0.013), and obese ( P,0.001).A majority (64.2%) had a concomitant diagnosis of autism spectrumdisorder.Common presenting musculoskeletal reports includeddifficulty walking, knee pain, and lower limb deformity.Burden ofdisease of scurvy was markedly greater than that of the average inpatient population, with these patients experiencing greater total charges and longer hospital stays.Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of the increasing incidence of scurvy in modern medicine.In cases of vague musculoskeletal reportswithout clear etiology, a diagnosis of scurvy should be considered,particularly if risk factors are present.

2,3 Although mucocutaneous symptoms such as gingival bleeding, corkscrew hairs, and petechiae commonly present in patients with scurvy, musculoskeletal reports are also commonly associated, particularly in the pedi- atric population.4,5Musculoskeletal manifestations of scurvy are varied, and current literature includes reports of bone pain resulting from subperiosteal hemorrhageand hematomas, arthralgias from hemarthrosis, and osteopenia and fractures, particularly involving the metaphysis.
5,6While some studies report over 80% of pediatric patients with scurvy having a musculoskeletal chief report, such as lower extremity pain, refusal to walk, or inability to bear weight, quantitative data remain limited.6,7 The multitude of case reports almost invariably sug- gests that scurvy is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients with musculoskeletal pain.7-9This is likely due to well-characterized ability of scurvy to masquerade as a number of other more common musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions such as bone tumors, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or septic arthritis.5,10-12Furthermore, several physicians are unaware of unique presentation of scurvy in the pediatric population and fail to include it on their dif- ferential because of its rarity.
Before presenting the epidemiological results of our investigation, the following aims to summarize the find-ings of recent case reports and provide orthopaedic physicians with a comprehensive resource for under- standing the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of scurvy. Diagnosis Often thought of as an outdated diagnosis, scurvy is frequently not included on the list of differential diag- noses for pediatric musculoskeletal reports, which results in delayed diagnosis, increased morbidity, and unneces- sarily invasive, costly testing.5,7,13The most common musculoskeletal presenting report of patients withscurvy is generalized lower extremity pain.4-6,14,15 Upper extremity symptoms have been reported but areless common.16,17These musculoskeletal symptomshave been theorized as sequelae of subperiosteal or soft- tissue hemorrhage and/or hemarthrosis,18,19commonly presenting in the pediatric patient as refusal to walk, inability to bear weight, or an antalgic gait.
In infants and young children, lower extremity pain may manifest as a pseudoparalysis.
Infants may display the charac- teristic ‘frog leg ’position,13,20with externally rotated and flexed hips and knees, while older children may present with flexion contractures at the knee.21 Additional musculoskeletal manifestations may include swelling of the knee or ankle joints, which may initially be misdiagnosed as septic arthritis or other joint pathologies.16,17In addition, in advanced disease, skeletal growth abnormalities, delayed bone age,14,16or beading at the costochondral joints, known as the ‘scorbutic rosary, ’may be observed.18Spontaneous fracture may occur, and this should raise suspicion for scurvy, particularly when these fractures show inade- quate or delayed healing.22 Mucocutaneous symptoms, such as gingival bleeding, corkscrew hairs, and petechiae, are commonly associated with scurvy (Figure 1).14,23Perifollicular hemorrhage and follicular hyperkeratosis, particularly of the lower extremity, may occur and are considered pathogno-monic.
19Other potential signs and symptoms include psychomotor restlessness, muscular weakness, irritabil- ity, excessive fatigue, and failure to thrive.22,24-26Thus, a young patient with scurvy may present with chief reports including rash, easy bruising, easy bleeding, fussiness in infant/toddler, generalized weakness/fatigue, or appetite/ gastrointestinal disturbances.
In addition, physicians should be aware that up to 80% of patients with scurvy may have concomitant iron-deficiency anemia, likely due to associated bleeding and potentially decreased iron absorption.13,19Iron-deficiency anemia may also be a manifestation of a poor diet and other co-occurring nutritional deficiencies.3,11,19 Radiological Findings Radiographs often reflect vitamin C ’s role in collagen synthesis, yielding common findings of subperiosteal hemorrhages, cortical irregularities, metaphyseal bands or fraying, physeal widening, and osteopenia.16,27,28 More specific findings include the Wimberger ring sign, rarefaction in the Trümmerfeld zone, Pelkan spurs, and the white line of Frankel (Figure 2).13,16However, in a case series by Pan et al,6two of nine patients did not have any of these pathognomonic radiographic findings, highlighting their low sensitivity.
Therefore, the lack of 2 Journal of the AAOS Global Research & Reviews® -----July 2024, Vol 8, No 7 -----© American Academy of Orthopaedic SurgeonsThe Troubling Rise of Scurvy these signs is not sufficient to exclude scurvy from a differential. Advanced imaging, namely MRI, may reveal diffuse bone marrow edema or subperiosteal fluid11,29 (Figure 3).MRI may aid in the diagnosis if otherimaging and laboratory findings are inconclusive, helping to distinguish scurvy from other marrow infil- trative disorders.29,30Alternative imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography, may also be used, often revealing joint effusions and edema about the perios- teum and the surrounding soft tissue.10 Treatment While diagnosis may prove challenging, treatment ofscurvy is simple, consisting of vitamin C supplementa- tion.Pediatric patients are treated with 100 to 300 mg daily and adults with 500 to 1000 mg daily for 1 month or until full symptom resolution.
13This treatment regi- men is often easily achieved through multivitamin supplementation and typically highly effective with most patients recovering without sequelae.9,10,29However, because most children develop scurvy as a result of severe food selectivity, long-term nutritional supple- mentation, nutritionist consultation, and dietarychanges may be necessary to prevent recurrence. 9 In the setting of more advanced disease and severe musculoskeletal manifestations such as fracture or physeal separation, orthopaedic intervention is war- ranted.In cases of pathologic fracture secondary to scurvy, conservative treatment of closed reduction and immobilization should be attempted, in conjunction with vitamin C supplementation.
In rare cases of delayed un- ion, open reduction may be indicated.13,17 Despite numerous case reports of pediatric scurvy in the literature, epidemiological data on its incidence in the United States have yet to be sufficiently identified.Figure 1 Illustration demonstrating the classical mucocutaneous findings of scurvy including gingival bleeding, perifollicular hemorrhage, petechiae, and corkscrew hairs.

Reikersdorfer, BA, et al Therefore, this study aims to assess the incidence of scurvy in the inpatient pediatric population with utili-zation of a large, validated national database. As a sec- ondary aim, analysis of commonly associated diagnoses is conducted to identify risk factors, which may aid in thediagnosis of scurvy.Methods Data Source and Collection This retrospective review queried the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample, from 2016to 2020.The National Inpatient Sample is a nationally representative, weighted sample of approximately 20% of all inpatient visits, enabling us to extrapolate incidenceacross the entire pediatric inpatient population.All pa- tients younger than 18 years were included in our analysis.Demographic data, including age, sex, race and ethnicity,household income level, and insurance status, were iden- tified using patient records.
Next, ICD-10 codes from each patient ’s single hospitalization were drawn, and those with a diagnosis of scurvy were identified. Con- current diagnoses, musculoskeletal and otherwise, werefurther recorded using ICD-10 codes.Statistical Analysis Study population demographics were compared with thoseof the remaining pediatric inpatient population usinganalysis of variance or chi-square with Kendall tau, where appropriate.P- v a l u e so f0 .0 5o rl e s sw e r ec o n s i d e r e d significant.Categorical var iables were reported as counts and proportions.Continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations.All statistical analyseswere conducted using R Foundat ion for Statistical Com- puting software version 4.20 with the Python package.Results Incidence and Demographics A total of 19,413,465 pediatric patients were identified and included in our analysis.A total of 265 patients with scurvy were identified.
Throughout our study period, theincidence of scurvy increased from 8.2 (SE = 0.2) per100,000 children in 2016 to 26.7 (SE = 0.4) per 100,000in 2020 (Figure 4). Population demographics are provided in Table 1.Of those with scurvy, the mean age was 2.15 (SD=4.78) years, 185 patients (69.8%) were male, 95 (36.5%) had a household income in the lowest quartile, and 75 (28.8%)had a household income in the highest quartile.Youngerage (P,0.001), male sex ( P= 0.010), and socioeconomic status in the lowest quartile ( P= 0.013) were significantly associated with a diagnosis of scurvy.No notable asso-ciations were observed between scurvy diagnosis andrace, residential setting (urban/rural), or payer.Concurrent Diagnoses A number of concurrent diagnoses were common in thescurvypopulation (Table 2).A total of 170 (64.2%) helda diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Fifteen(5.7%) were diagnosed with cerebral palsy.One hun- dred thirty-five (50.9%) had a concomitant vitamin D deficiency.
One hundred sixty-five (62.3%) had adiagnosed anemia. Ninety (33.6%) had a documenteddisorder of the gingiva.Twenty (7.6%) had obesity and 10 (3.8%) had morbid obesity (Table 1), bothFigure 3 Radiographs demonstrating scurvy-related subperiosteal hemorrhage visualized on MRI.Images courtesy of Boston Children ’s Hospital.4 Journal of the AAOS Global Research & Reviews® -----July 2024, Vol 8, No 7 -----© American Academy of Orthopaedic SurgeonsThe Troubling Rise of Scurvy significantly greater than the inpatient population ( P, 0.001).Regarding musculoskeletal disorders, 55 patients (20.8%) in the study population had pain in the lower extremity, 35 (13.2%) had a documented acquired deformity of the lower limb, and 30 (11.3%) had a diagnosis indicating difficulty walking (Table 2).Burden of Illness Patients in the study group and the hospital systemexperienced markedly greater burden of illness, as com- pared with those without scurvy (Table 3).
In addition, compared with those without, patients with scurvy had a longer average length of stay (10.83 versus 4.05 days, P,0.001), greater average cost of hospitalization ($163,415.90 versus $30,552.73, P,0.001), and increased rate of adverse discharge, defined as anynonhome discharge (15.1% versus 2.9%, P,0.001). Discussion Although scurvy remains rare in the modern United States, we report that the incidence of scurvy in the inpatient pediatric population has steadily increased from 8.2 per 100,000 in 2016 to 26.7 per 100,000 in 2020.Populations found to be at increased risk for the development of scurvy include those of male sex and children with families in the lowest income quartile.
Inpatients with scurvy, concomitant diagnoses of ASD, cerebral palsy, vitamin D deficiencies, anemia, gingival disease, and obesity were common.At-Risk Populations Particular patient populations may be at increased risk of developing scurvy, particularly those with an elevated risk of nutritional deficiency due to biological, psycho- logical, or environmental factors. The vast majority of case reports in recent years have involved children with ASD or other neuro- developmental disorders.9,31,32This is thought to be associated with extreme food selectivity, which predis- poses patients to nutritional deficiencies.3,9,14This was reflected in our study because a majority (64.15%) of patients with scurvy were found to have a concomitant diagnosis of ASD.The association between ASD and scurvy may explain several other associations observed in our sample, namely the male preponderance and increased rates of obesity found in our study population.
Males are 3x more likely than females to be diagnosedwith ASD. 33Furthermore, children with ASD are more likely to be overweight.34 Although not explored in this study, additional diag- noses such as eating disorders, end-stage renal disease, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and behavioral food selectivity may also increase risk of scurvy.35-37Envi- ronmental factors such as lack of access to affordable, nutrient-dense foods may also pose a risk for the development of nutritional deficiencies, including scurvy.Such an association may help to contextualize the increased rates of obesity and low-income quartile among those with scurvy.This emphasizes the impor- tance of addressing the social determinants of health,Figure 4 Graph demonstrating the incidence of scurvy, by year, per 100,000 children.
Incidence per 100,000 children (standard error) by year is as follows: 8.21 (0.20) in 2016; 9.90 (0.23) in 2017; 15.89 (0.25) in 2018; 15.74 (0.32) in 2019; 26.67 (0.41) in 2020. Journal of the AAOS Global Research & Reviews® -----July 2024, Vol 8, No 7 -----© American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons 5Research ArticleKristen N.Reikersdorfer, BA, et al both in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with scurvy.Another associated demographic factor was markedly younger age.The presence of this, or any of the above predisposing conditions, should prompt physicians to consider scurvy in a child presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms and warrants inves tigation into the patient ’s dietary habits.Consideration of daily vitamin C supple-mentation may also be approp riate in the aforementioned populations, as to decrease the risk of developing scurvy.
Burden of Care Results show that scurvy places a sizable burden on pa- tients, families, and the hospital system as measured bylength of stay, cost of hospitalization, and rate of adverse discharges. However, it is important to note that these findings may be confounded by the complexity of these patients ’care because of concomitant diagnoses.Nonetheless, these burdens further suggest the impor- tance of readily considering scurvy when forming adifferential diagnosis, especially given its available and efficacious treatments.Limitations This study was not without limitation.For example, ourdataset was analyzed using ICD-10 classifications, which may be susceptible to miscoding or undercoding.Because weight classification was not available for allTable 1.

Therefore, although we cannot report an accurate prevalence of scurvy among childrenwith obesity with confidence, we can be confident in theassociation between these two diseases. Similarly,musculoskeletal reports, such as joint pain, are likelyboth underreported and underdocumented.Therefore,our reported counts of musculoskeletal manifestationslikely underestimate the true number of patients withthese symptoms.Still, our findings show common re-ports that are consistent with reports in the literature.Secondly, this study used inpatient data to estimate the incidence of scurvy.As a result, the conclusions must beinterpreted in the context of t he database available to us and limit the confidence in the gener alizability of our findings.We may be underestimating in cidence by overlooking pa- tients treated as outpatient; however, this number is likely small because of the rarity of dis ease, difficulty in diagnosis, and concomitant comorbidities in this population.
Withthat said, this study still represents the most comprehensive epidemiological report on the subject to date. Finally, it is important to note the potential that the increased incidence reported here is, in part, attributed toincreased awareness and testing.With that said, this re-mains an open question because the total number ofpatients tested for scurvy each year is unknown.Conclusion While often thought of as a historic disease, pediatricscurvy has reemerged as a modern problem, with itsincidence more than tripling over the 5-year period inthis study (2016 to 2020).This is the first study, to ourknowledge, to evaluate scurvy in the US pediatricpopulation using a large national database.Relevantdemographic factors associated with scurvy identified inthis study include male sex and family income in theTable 2.
