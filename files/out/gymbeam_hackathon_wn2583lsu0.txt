Genetic Analysis Using Vitamin B 6Antagonist 4- Deoxypyridoxine Uncovers a Connection between Pyridoxal 5 9- Phosphate and Coenzyme A Metabolism in Salmonella enterica Huong N.Vu ,a Diana M.Downsa aDepartment of Microbiology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA ABSTRACT Pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for organisms in all three domains of life.Despite the central role of PLP, many aspects of vitamin B6 metabolism, including its integration with other biological pathways, are not fully understood.In this study, we examined the metabolic perturbations caused by the vitamin B6antagonist 4-deoxypyridoxine (dPN) in a ptsJ mutant of Salmonella enter- icaserovar Typhimurium LT2.Our data suggest that PdxK (pyridoxal/pyridoxine/pyri- doxamine kinase [EC 2.7.1.35]) phosphorylates dPN to 4-deoxypyridoxine 5 9-phos- phate (dPNP), which in turn can compromise the de novo biosynthesis of PLP.
The data are consistent with the hypothesis that accumulated dPNP inhibits GlyA (serine hydroxymethyltransferase [EC 2.1.2.1]) and/or GcvP (glycine decarboxylase [EC 1.4.4.2]), two PLP-dependent enzymes involved in the generation of one-carbonunits. Our data suggest that this inhibition leads to reduced ﬂux to coenzyme A (CoA) precursors and subsequently decreased synthesis of CoA and thiamine.This study uncovers a link between vitamin B 6metabolism and the biosynthesis of CoA and thiamine, highlighting the integration of biochemical pathways in microbes.IMPORTANCE PLP is a ubiquitous cofactor required by enzymes in diverse metabolic networks.The data presented here expand our understanding of the toxic effects ofdPN, a vitamin B 6antagonist that is often used to mimic vitamin B6deﬁciency and to study PLP-dependent enzyme kinetics.In addition to de novo PLP biosynthesis, we de ﬁne a metabolic connection between vitamin B6metabolism and synthesis of thiamine and CoA.
This work provides a foundation for the use of dPN to study vita- min B6metabolism in other organisms. KEYWORDS pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate, vitamin B6, 4-deoxypyridoxine, PtsJ, thiamine, CoA, coenzyme A, PLP, ptsJ Pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate (PLP) is the biologically active form of vitamin B6and a required cofactor in the metabolism of all organisms.Due to its unique chemical properties, PLP can facilitate diverse enzymatic reactions, including transamination,elimination, decarboxylation, and racemization (1).PLP-dependent enzymes, which areclassi ﬁed into seven fold types based on structural similarities (2), account for ;4% of all activities described by the Enzyme Commission (3).Most PLP-dependent enzymes, with the exception of glycogen phosphorylases, are associated with metabolic reac- tions that involve amino substrates (3).In nature, PLP is synthesized de novo via one of two biosynthetic routes (Fig.1).
The deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)-dependent pathway is found primarily in gammap-roteobacteria such as Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli , while the DXP-independ- ent pathway is widespread among other bacteria, fungi, and archaea (4, 5). Alternatively, PLP can be acquired from other B 6vitamers using the salvage pathway, as found in humans and animals (4, 5) (Fig.1).Due to the reactivity of this cofactor and the prevalenceEditor Anke Becker, Philipps University Marburg Copyright © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.All Rights Reserved .Address correspondence to Diana M.Downs, dmdowns@uga.edu.The authors declare no con ﬂict of interest.

Despite the importance of this cofactor, the mechanism (or mechanisms) used by cells to control PLP homeostasis is not fully understood.One approach to study vitamin B6metabolism involves the use of analogs, i.e., com- pounds that are structurally similar to B6vitamers but lack the biochemical properties to aid enzyme catalysis.In particular, 4-deoxypyridoxine (dPN) (Fig.1) and its phospho- rylated derivative 4-deoxypyridoxine 5 9-phosphate (dPNP) have been used as potent vitamin B6antagonists in research for decades.
Early studies in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals focused on the inhibitory effects of dPN on growth, morphology, and the metabolism of other vitamins (11). Later work showed that dPN and dPNP could com-petitively inhibit the in vitro activity of the human pyridoxal (PL)/pyridoxine (PN)/pyri- doxamine (PM) kinase (PdxK) (EC 2.7.1.35) (12) and pyridoxine 5 9-phosphate (PNP)/pyri- doxamine 5 9-phosphate (PMP) oxidase (PdxH) (EC 1.4.3.5) (13), which are conserved enzymes essential for the salvage of B 6vitamers (Fig.1).This study was initiated to understand the mechanism of dPN toxicity in S.enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (referred to here as S.enterica ) using phenotypic and metabolite analyses.Our results uncover a link between vitamin B6metabolism and the biosynthesis of thiamine and FIG 1 PLP biosynthesis and salvage.In S.enterica , PLP can be synthesized de novo via the DXP-dependent pathway (black box) or salvaged from other B6vitamers (green box).
Other organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , use the DXP-independent pathway (blue box) to synthesize PLP in addition to salvage. Animals, including humans, lack the biosynthetic pathway and rely exclusively on salvage to acquire this cofactor.Relevant enzymes involved in biosynthesis and salvage of PLP are shown next to the arrows, each of whichrepresents a biochemical reaction catalyzed by the corresponding enzyme.Vu and Downs Journal of Bacteriology March 2022 Volume 204 Issue 3 e00607-21 jb.asm.org 2 coenzyme A (CoA), highlighting the complexity of metabolic networks and the primary consequences of perturbed pools of B6vitamers.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sensitivity of a ptsJmutant to dPN is dependent on PdxK.While growth of an S.enterica wild-type strain in minimal no-carbon E (NCE) glycerol was not affected by 10mM dPN, the presence of this antagonist inhibited growth if pdxK was overex- pressed in trans (data not shown).
Consistently, a strain lacking PtsJ, a MocR-type tran- scriptional repressor that regulates expression of pdxK (14), was sensitive to dPN in minimal NCE glucose in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a).A null mutation in pdxK (Fig.2a) or expression of ptsJ intrans (Fig.2b) overcame the growth defect caused by dPN of the ptsJ mutant.These data showed the importance of PtsJ and PdxK in modu- lating dPN sensitivity.Unphosphorylated B6vitamers are thought to enter cells via facilitated diffusion and subsequently be trapped by phosphorylation (15 –17).In addition, the human homolog of PdxK could use dPN as a substrate in vitro (18).Taken together, the data suggest that, to be toxic, dPN was phosphorylated to dPNP by PdxK.Consistent withthis hypothesis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed thataptsJ strain grown in minimal glucose medium supplemented with dPN (0.5 mM) accu- mulated intracellular dPNP ( ;555642 pmol/optical density at 650 nm [OD650] unit).
No dPNP was detected in cells grown in the absence of dPN (Fig. 2c).When a mutationinpdxK was introduced in the pstJ background, the pro ﬁles of intracellular B 6vitamers in the absence and presence of dPN were indistinguishable.In total, these data sup- port the conclusion that dPNP is the molecule that exerts toxic effects on S.enterica and, by extension, other organisms that possess homologs of PdxK.DXP-dependent biosynthesis of PLP is compromised in the presence of dPNP.dPNP inhibited both the E.coli and human homologs of PdxH by competing with the native substrates PNP and PMP in vitro (13, 19).If such inhibition were to occur in vivo , then the growth defect of the S.enterica ptsJ mutant in the presence of dPN could be due to PLP limitation resulting from decreased PdxH activity.Growth of the ptsJ mu- tant in the presence of dPN was restored to different degrees with supplementation with 1 mM PL, PN, or PM (Fig.3a).
However, it was unclear whether these vitamers res- cued growth by competing with dPN for transport, or for PdxK as the substrates or byincreasing intracellular PLP content. To help distinguish between these possibilities, the DXP-dependent PLP biosynthe- sis was eliminated in the ptsJ mutant by deleting pdxJ (encoding a PNP synthase [EC 2.6.99.2]) and pdxH.As a replacement for the native synthetic route, Saccharomyces cer- evisiae SNZ3 (encoding a PLP synthase [EC 4.3.3.6]) was expressed in trans.The result- ing strain synthesizes PLP from endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, and exogenous ammonium in the medium using Snz3p (20) (Fig.1).Growth of ptsJ strains carrying different PLP biosynthetic pathways in the presence of dPN was examined in minimal NCE glycerol (Fig.3b).Strains lacking ptsJ and utilizing either the native (DXP-dependent) or heterologous (Snz3p-dependent) pathway forPLP synthesis grew similarly in the absence of dPN.
When dPN was added, growth inhi-bition of the ptsJ strain synthesizing PLP with Snz3p was signi ﬁcantly less severe than that of the ptsJ strain using the native pathway. These data are consistent with the hy- pothesis that dPNP compromises the DXP-dependent PLP synthesis, while the remain- ing growth defect suggests that PdxH is not the only target of dPNP toxicity.dPNP impacts ThiC-dependent thiamine synthesis.Probing the mechanism of dPNP toxicity beyond the presumed inhibition of PdxH required that the concentrationof dPN be reduced to allow growth.Nutritional experiments showed that, in the pres-ence of low levels of dPN (0.5 mM), the ptsJ strain was sensitive to adenosine, which was rescued by thiamine addition (Fig.4).
The ability of thiamine to abolish the syner-gistic effect of adenosine and dPN was reminiscent of previous studies, in which aden-osine sensitivity indicated compromised synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thia- mine (4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine [HMP]). In those cases, adenosine4-Deoxypyridoxine Limits CoA Synthesis Journal of Bacteriology March 2022 Volume 204 Issue 3 e00607-21 jb.asm.org 3 reduced ﬂux toward 5-aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR) formation, which lowered HMP synthesis only if the ef ﬁciency of the AIR !4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimi- dine phosphate (HMP-P) reaction was diminished (21 –24) (Fig.5a).We hypothesized that the AIR !HMP-P conversion, catalyzed by ThiC (25, 26), was decreased in the pres- ence of dPNP.In this scenario, the synergetic effects of adenosine and dPN would be due to reduced ﬂux to AIR and reduced conversion of AIR to HMP-P, respectively.
The effect of dPN on the ef ﬁciency of the AIR !HMP-P conversion was tested using a bio- sensor strain (DM7060) carrying a ptsJ mutation. The genotype of this strain allows the FIG 2 dPN sensitivity of a ptsJ mutant is PdxK-dependent.(a) S.enterica ptsJ (DM17239), pdxK (DM17238), and ptsJ pdxK (DM17168) were grown in minimal NCE glucose without (white symbols) or with addition of 0.1 mM (light gray symbols), 0.5 mM (dark gray symbols), or 10 mM (black symbols) dPN.(b) ptsJ strains carrying an empty vector control (pCV1) (DM17242) or a vector expressing ptsJ in trans (pptsJ) (DM17243) were grown in minimal NCE glucose supplemented with 0.02% arabinose in the absence (white symbols) or presence (black symbols) of 10 mM dPN.(c) HPLC chromatogram of intracellular vitamin B6content of ptsJ (DM17239) and ptsJ pdxK (DM17168) strains grown in minimal NCE glucose with or without addition of 0.5 mM dPN.

The AIRs requirement of the purGE stm4068 ptsJ strain was assessed with soft agar overlay on minimal NCE glucose medium supplemented with adenine as a source forpurines (Fig. 5b and c).In the absence of dPN, the mutant grew with addition of AIRs,HMP, or thiamine (Fig.5b), as expected.When dPN (0.1 mM) was added to the medium, overall growth was not as robust.Nonetheless, it was still clear that growth was notsupported by the amount of AIRs that allowed growth in the absence of dPN (Fig.5c).These results indicated that the ptsJ mutant required more AIRs to grow in the pres- ence of dPN, supporting the conclusion that the ef ﬁciency of AIR !HMP-P conversion by ThiC was compromised in the presence of dPNP.FIG 4 Adenosine exacerbates dPN sensitivity.The S.enterica ptsJ strain (DM17239) was grown in minimal NCE glucose supplemented with dPN (0.5 mM) in the absence (white symbols) or presence of adenosine (1 mM) (gray symbols) and thiamine (0.1 mM) (black symbols).

Defects in several meta- bolic processes affect ThiC activity in vivo , including iron-sulfur cluster metabolism (28), synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from methionine (30), and intracellular CoA levels (31) (Fig.6a).If dPNP caused a defect in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis/repair, both the HMP and thiazole (THZ) branches of thiamine synthesis would be expected tobe compromised (28, 32 –35) (Fig.5a).However, only HMP-P synthesis was affected by dPNP (Fig.5c).If the synthesis of AdoMet and/or CoA was compromised by dPNP, then methionine or pantothenate, respectively, should alter growth.The impact of these FIG 5 dPN increases the AIRs requirement for ThiC-dependent thiamine synthesis.(a) Thiamine and purine biosynthesis and salvage in S.enterica .

Consistent with this hy- pothesis, a ptsJ mutant had a signi ﬁcant;2-fold decrease in the total CoA pool when grown in medium supplemented with dPN (0.5 mM) (Fig. 6c).The weak stimulation by b-alanine was considered to be due to increased ﬂux through PanC when the pan- toate substrate level was decreased.Addition of a-ketoisovalerate (KIV), serine, or glycine also decreased the AIRs require- ment for growth in dPN (Fig.6b).Serine and glycine are substrates in the generation ofone-carbon units by GlyA (serine hydroxymethyltransferase [EC 2.1.2.1]) and the glycine cleavage (GCV) system, respectively (Fig.6a).Both reactions produce 5,10-methylenetetra- hydrofolate (mTHF) (36, 37), which is a cosubstrate for PanB (ketopantoate hydroxymethyl-transferase [EC 2.1.2.11]) to convert KIV to ketopantoate (Fig.6a).The PanB-dependent reaction was suggested to be the rate-limiting step for CoA synthesis (38).
Notably, GlyA and GcvP (glycine decarboxylase [EC 1.4.4.2]) of the GCV system are PLP-dependent enzymes, which could be targeted by dPNP. There is precedent for damaged GlyA causing FIG 6 Precursors for CoA synthesis eliminate dPN sensitivity of a ptsJ mutant.(a) The integrated serine-glycine metabolic node, CoA, and thiamine synthesis in S.enterica .Blue indicates metabolites that mitigate the inhibition of dPN on ThiC-dependent thiamine synthesis, while those in red havelittle to no effect.Solid arrows indicate biochemical reactions in the pathways.Dashed arrows depictmetabolic processes that affect ThiC activity.(b) The purGE stm4068 ptsJ strain (DM17274) was mixed with soft agar and overlaid onto minimal NCE glucose containing adenine (0.4 mM) and dPN (0.1 mM) without or with one of the following supplementations: pantothenate (0.1 mM), pantoate (0.1 mM), b-alanine (0.1 mM), KIV (0.1 mM), serine (2.5 mM), glycine (0.67 mM), or methionine (0.3 mM).

Although the effect of dPNP on GcvP has not been reported, PNP, a B6vitamer with a structure similar to that of dPNP (Fig. 1), could inhibit the in vitro activity of E.coli and Bacillus subtilis GCV systems (41).In total, the data are consistent with a model in which dPNP inhibits GlyA and/or the GCV system by competing with PLP.Such inhibition would lead to a reduction in mTHF levels and decrease ﬂux to CoA synthesis.Working model for growth limitation by dPN.The cumulative effects of dPN tox- icity, exacerbated by a ptsJ mutation, are depicted in Fig.7.Our working model sug- gests that exogenous dPN is phosphorylated to dPNP by PdxK (Fig.2).Intracellular dPNP then competes with PNP for binding to PdxH and thus compromises the DXP-de-pendent synthesis of PLP (Fig.3).Additionally, dPNP inhibits the activity of the GlyAand/or GcvP PLP-dependent enzymes, which reduces the levels of mTHF.
Finally,lower-than-optimal mTHF levels compromise the activity of PanB, reducing formation of pantothenate and decreasing ﬂux to CoA (Fig. 6).Reduced CoA levels then indirectly affect the synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine, resulting in overall lower thi-amine formation (Fig.4 and 5).The conclusions made from phenotypic analyses are bolstered by considering the kinetic parameters of PdxH.Based on HPLC data, the intracellular concentration of dPNP was estimated to be ;4-fold and 350-fold higher than those of PMP and PNP, respectively, under conditions where growth was signi ﬁcantly impaired (data not shown).The binding af ﬁnity of dPNP for E.coli PdxH is similar to that of PMP and ;50- fold lower than that of PNP (19).Together, these considerations support the ability of dPNP to compete with PNP and/or PMP for PdxH and reduce its ability to generatePLP.
Similar kinetic parameters with GlyA and GcvP have not been reported, and addi-tional in vitro experiments are required to further support the genetic analyses. It was somewhat surprising that PdxY was not involved in dPNP toxicity, since it is another PL kinase (EC 2.7.1.35) involved in B 6salvage (42).PdxK and PdxY have promis- cuous kinase activity with pyrimidine and pyridine derivatives, including the HMP moi-ety of thiamine and unphosphorylated B 6vitamers (42 –45).A potential explanation for the lack of a role for PdxY is that S.enterica evolved differential regulation of pdxK and FIG 7 Working model regarding how dPN affects S.enterica metabolism.PdxK converts exogenous dPN to dPNP, which inhibits PLP biosynthesis via PdxH, leading to PLP limitation.In addition, dPNPinhibits the PLP-dependent enzyme GlyA and/or GcvP, decreasing ﬂux through the pantoate branch of CoA synthesis.Reduced CoA levels indirectly dampen ThiC-dependent thiamine synthesis.

Strains lacking PtsJ, like those used here, led to an ;80-fold increase in expres- sion of pdxK , while only a 2- to 3-fold increase was observed with pdxY (14).Alternatively, PdxY may not phosphorylate dPN with the ef ﬁciency that would make it relevant under the conditions tested.This work did not address whether dPN/dPNP could be metabolized or detoxi ﬁed in S.enterica .Rapid excretion and modi ﬁcation of dPN was proposed to be a detoxifying mechanism in humans and rats, in which dPN appeared to be converted to 4-deoxy-5- pyridoxic acid and deoxypyridoxine-3-(hydrogen sulfate), respectively (46).Isolationand characterization of S.enterica mutants that are more or less sensitive to dPN could address whether such a mechanism exists in bacteria.In total, this study contributes to our understanding of the mechanism by which exoge- nous dPN inhibits growth in S.
enterica . The data presented here provide a framework for probing the metabolic network structure involving vitamin B 6in other organisms.Furthermore, use of dPN provides an additional means to disrupt PLP metabolism, which can be coupled with mutations that impact PLP-dependent enzymes and PLP homeostasis, such as ridA and yggS, respectively, to better understand additional metabolic aspects of this critical cofactor.MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains, plasmids, and primers.Strains and plasmids are presented in Table 1.Primers used for strain and plasmid construction are listed in Table 2.Strains are derivatives of S.enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2.Escherichia coli DH5aand BL21AI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to propagate plasmids and purify recombinant protein, respectively.Phage kRed recombineering (47) was adapted forS.enterica to generate gene deletions.

The level of internal dPNP accumula-tion was inferred by quantifying the concentration of dPN in phosphatase-treated samples.Assessment of AIRs requirement.S.enterica purGE stm4068 ptsJ (DM17274) was precultured in 2 mL nutrient broth and washed as described for growth analysis.Three milliliters of molten soft agar(0.7% [wt/vol]) seeded with 100 mL washed cells was overlaid onto minimal NCE glucose containing ade- nine (0.4 mM), without or with the addition of dPN (0.1 mM), pantothenate (0.1 mM), pantoate (0.1 mM), b-alanine (0.1 mM), KIV (0.1 mM), serine (2.5 mM), glycine (0.67 mM), or methionine (0.3 mM).One microliter of ;300 mM AIRs, 0.1 mM thiamine, 0.1 mM HMP, and 0.1 mM THZ was subsequently spotted on top of the solidi ﬁed agar layer.
After overnight incubation at 37°C, plates were photographed using a FOTO/Analyst FX workstation (Fotodyne, Hartland, WI). Puriﬁcation and activity assay of B.subtilis PTA.The E.coli BL21AI strain carrying pBsPTA1 was precultured in 10 mL lysogeny broth in duplicate at 37°C in an Innova 43 shaker (New BrunswickScienti ﬁc) at 250 rpm.Overnight cultures were inoculated into two Fernbach ﬂasks, each of which con- tained 1.5 L of super broth.Growth was resumed at 37°C in an Innova 44 shaker (New Brunswick Scienti ﬁc) at 180 rpm until mid-log phase (OD 650of;0.6), as determined by a Spectronic 20D 1instru- ment (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA).After the addition of arabinose (0.02% [wt/vol]) and iso- propyl- b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mM) to induce expression of pta, the temperature was shifted to 30°C.Cells were harvested (6,000 /C2gfor 15 min at 4°C) after 20 h and stored at 280°C until puri ﬁcation.Protein puri ﬁcation and dialysis steps were performed at 4°C.
The frozen cell pellet was resuspended (3 mL/g wet weight) in buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole [pH 7.5]) containing ly-sozyme (1 mg/mL), DNase (0.14 mg/mL), and phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) (1 mM) and was lysed at 18,000 lb/in 2using a Constant Systems Limited One Shot cell disruptor (Northants, UK). The cell lysate was clari ﬁed (45,000 /C2gfor 45 min at 4°C), ﬁltered (0.45- mm polyvinylidene di ﬂuoride [PVDF]), and loaded onto a preequilibrated 5-mL HisTrap HP Ni-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL)using an NGC Quest 10 chromatography system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).The loaded column was washed and eluted with 10 column volumes (CVs) of buffer A, 6 CVs of 4% buffer B (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole [pH 7.5]), and a 10-CV gradient of 4 to 100% buffer B at a ﬂow rate of 2 mL/min.Fractions containing PTA were visualized on a 14% SDS-PAGE gel and pooled.
Protein was concentratedusing an Amicon Ultra-15 30K centrifugal ﬁlter unit (MilliporeSigma), dialyzed overnight against buffer C (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol [pH 7.5]), ﬂash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at 280°C until assay. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc), from the calculated molecular mass and extinction coefﬁcient (ExPASy).Enzyme activity was assayed using a previously described protocol (56) adapted for 96-well plates.
Brieﬂy, 0 to 10 ng of PTA was added to a 300- mL reaction mixture containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.6 mM glutathione, 0.4 mM CoA, 7.2 mM acetyl phosphate, and 13.3 mM (NH4)2SO4to initiate theTABLE 2 Primers used in this study Primer Sequence (5 9to 3 9) Description PR1383 GGAAAATTTTATGGGACAAGAGAGTGATATTCAGTCAGTGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC Inactivation of pdxK PR1384 CGATAACTCTTCATCGCGCCTCCCCTGCCGGCGGCAGAATCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGTTCCTATTCC Inactivation of pdxK PR1461 ATTAAAGGCAGTCCGTCTCCCGTAGCGCTGGAAGGCGGCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC Inactivation of ptsJ PR1462 TCCCTCACGTACCAGCCAGCCGGATTTTGCCAACGTAAACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGTTCCTATTCC Inactivation of ptsJ PR1318 NNGCTCTTCNTTCATGGGACAAGAGAGTGATATTCAGTCAGTG Construction of pDM1643 PR1319 NNGCTCTTCNTTATCATCGCGCCTCCCCTG Construction of pDM1643PR1449 NNGCTCTTCNTTCATGATCGACGGAAAAACCGCTAACGAAATTTTTGACAG Construction of pDM1647 PR1450 NNGCTCTTCNTTATTAGCGATTTAGCGCCTGATGGATATCAGCC Construction of pDM1647Vu and Downs Journal of Bacteriology March 2022 Volume 204 Issue 3 e00607-21 jb.asm.org 10 reaction.
Acetyl-CoA formation was monitored at 233 nm ( «233= 4.44 mM21cm21) in a 96-well quartz plate using a SpectraMax 398 Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized to a 1-cm pathlength. One unit of PTA converts 1 mmol of CoA to acetyl-CoA per minute at 25°C (pH 7.4) using acetyl phosphate as a substrate.CoA quanti ﬁcation.Total CoA was determined as described (57, 58) with modi ﬁcations.The S.enter- ica ptsJ strain (DM17239) was precultured in 10 mL nutrient broth in triplicate overnight.Cells were washed with an equal volume of 0.85% NaCl and inoculated (2% [vol/vol]) into Klett ﬂasks containing 200 mL minimal NCE glucose without or with 0.5 mM dPN supplementation.After reaching an OD650of 0.7 to 0.8, cells were harvested (8,000 /C2gfor 15 min at 4°C), washed with 5 mL cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored at 280°C until analysis.Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in cold PBS and lysed by the addition of formic acid to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.3 N.
After a 30-min incubation on ice with occasional agitation, cell debris was pel-leted (17,000 /C2gfor 10 min at 4°C), and the lysate was neutralized with NH 4OH (pH ;6.5 to 7.5). Dithiothreitol (0.7% [vol/vol]) was added to aliquots of neutralized lysate to reductively cleave CoA thio- esters.The assay mixture (120 mL) contained 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mM KCl, 15 mM malate, 6 mM acetyl phosphate, 1 mM NAD1, 0.4 U porcine citrate synthase, 2 U porcine malate dehydrogenase, 40 mL treated extract, and 0.8 U B.subtilis PTA, which was added last to initiate the reaction.NADH formation was monitored at 340 nm in a 96-well quartz plate and normalized to a 1-cm pathlength using aSpectraMax 398 Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices).The CoA level for each biological sample was measured with four technical replicates and normalized to dry cell weight.A 7-point standard curve was generated with the addition of 0 to 1.2 nmol CoA and was used as reference for CoA quanti ﬁcation.
