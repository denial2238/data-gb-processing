Since NASH is a precursor of liver cancer, we alsoperformed meta-analysis of human liver cancer transcriptomes thatuncovered betacellulin as a key EGFR-binding protein upregulated inliver cancer and downregulated by ω3PUFAs in animals and humans with NASH. We then confirmed that betacellulin acts by promotingproliferation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells, inducing trans-forming growth factor –β2and increasing collagen production.When used in combination with TLR 2/4agonists, betacellulin upregulated integrins in macrophages thereby potentiating inflammation andfibrosis.Taken together, our results suggest that suppression ofbetacellulin is one of the key mechanisms associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of ω3PUFA on NASH.Keywords betacellulin; docosahexaenoic acid; multi-omic network; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; ω3PUFA Subject Categories Digestive System; Metabolism DOI 10.15252 /emmm.
202318367 | Received 19July 2023 | Revised 19Septem- ber2023 | Accepted 21September 2023 | Published online 20October 2023 EMBO Mol Med ( 2023 )15:e18367Introduction Metabolic diseases associated with obesity have increased to epi- demic proportions in recent years and are one of the leadingcauses of morbidity and mortality (Konerman et al ,2018 ; Dufour et al ,2022 ). Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), type 2 diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases are all associated with obesity and a sedentarylifestyle (Marjot et al,2020 ; Lazarus et al,2022 ).About 80 million adults and 13 million children are obese in the US alone.Amongthese, 60 percent of patients with body mass index >30 have evi- dence of liver steatosis (Jump et al ,2015 ; Dufour et al ,2022 ).NASH is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD) and is a major risk factor for cirrhosis, hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) and liver failure.
While treatments to manage theco-morbidities associated with NASH, i.e., obesity and type 2 dia-betes are available, NASH has no specific FDA-approved treatment.Thus, lifestyle modifications and dietary interventions are the cur-rent options available to NASH patients. Most if not all drugswhich targeted individual molecules or specific pathways havefailed to significantly improve the NASH patient (Neuschwander-Tetri, 2020 ; Pfister et al ,2021 ; Ampuero et al,2022 ; Dufour et al, 2022 ).This strategy that has been effective in the treatment of other diseases might not be adequate for NAFLD/NASH therapybecause it does not address entirely the complexity of this diseaseand may miss the master regulators involved in disease onset andprogression.

Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0license EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 1of21 Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( ω3 PUFA) are known to be consistently lower in livers of NASH patients when compared tohealthy patients or patients with benign steatosis (Burke et al,1999 ; Frid/C19enet al ,2021 ). This prompted us to hypothesize that dietary supplementation with ω3 PUFA would restore liver functions.Indeed, this strategy was very successful in a preclinical mousemodel, not only reducing liver steatosis but also in attenuating west-ern diet-induced hepatic fibrosis (Depner et al ,2013a ,b; Jump et al ,2015 ).Moreover, ω3 fatty acid treatment of children and adults with NAFLD have demonstrated these dietary lipids reducehepatic steatosis and hepatic injury (Iannelli et al,2013 ; Spooner & Jump, 2019 ).
While it is well established that ω3 PUFA have the capacity to regulate hepatic mechanisms controlling fatty acid syn-thesis and oxidation, as well as inflammation, it is less clear if thesepathways form the extent of ω3 fatty acid regulation of hepatic func- tion (Jump et al ,2018 ). Despite several studies demonstrating the therapeutic effects of ω3 PUFA in NAFLD/NASH models the mecha- nism of action has been elusive.Nevertheless, it is important to notethat many studies demonstrated diverse effects of ω3 in the liver ranging from immune-modulatory activities (Guti /C19errez et al ,2019 ) and improvement of oxidative stress (Yang et al,2019 ) to structural effects related to incorporation of phospholipids into the mitochon-drial membrane, altogether with potentially positive impact on liverfunction.
In addition to the effects of ω3 PUFA on hepatic cells, recent studies suggest that ω3 PUFA can alter gut microbiota, a known player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH (Watsonet al ,2018 ). Furthermore, preclinical and clinical studies demon- strated that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3) might be a more efficient agent than eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω3) in preventing and treating NAFLD (Depner et al ,2013a ,b; Spooner & Jump, 2019 ).Thus, while there are many studies describing different molecu- lar and cellular effects of ω3 fatty acids (Hodson et al,2017 ;Z o ¨hrer et al ,2017 ; Musa-Veloso et al ,2018 ; Okada et al ,2018 ; Tobin et al,2018 ;ˇSm/C19ıdet al,2022 ) and some evidence that they may be an effective therapy for NAFLD/NASH, the key mechanisms of howthey improve liver health is unknown.As such, we used a compre-hensive unbiased systems approach to answer these questions.
Forthis, we evaluated the liver transcriptome, metabolome and lipi-dome and assessed causal inferences via multi-omic network analy-sis to identify prospective mechanism operating in the diseased liverthat were restored by EPA and/or DHA. Since NASH is one of theprecursors of liver cancer, we also performed a meta-analysis of human liver cancer to evaluate which aspects of NASH pathogenesisleading to cancer are reversed by ω3 fatty acids.Together, our stud- ies pointed to betacellulin (BTC), one of several epidermal growthfactor receptor (EGFR) agonists, as a master regulatory moleculethat was downregulated by ω3 PUFA in the NASH liver.We further validated the impact of BTC in cell culture experiments that estab-lished TGF β-2 and integrins as the main downstream molecular tar- gets of BTC in human hepatic stellate cells and macrophages,respectively.Suppression of these pathways specifically by DHAleads to attenuated fibrosis in NASH.
Thus, our study disclosed anentirely novel mechanism for ω3 fatty acid control of hepatic func- tion and its beneficial action against detrimental molecular events inthe liver leading to NASH. Results DHA reverses the effects of WD more effectively than EPA We first performed a comprehensive analysis of molecular changes contributing to prevention of NAFLD/NASH by two ω3 PUFA, namely docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6, ω3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω3).For this, we evaluated histological markers of NASH (Dataset EV1a), transcriptomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic changes caused by DHA and EPA in the whole tissue liver samplesfrom Ldlr /C0//C0mice fed a western diet (WD) with the addition (or not) of DHA or EPA (Depner et al,2013a ; Fig 1A–C, Dataset EV1b).To focus our analysis on disease features corrected by ω3 PUFA, we first established which changes induced by WD were reversed byDHA or EPA treatment (see Materials and Methods for details).
We then established four categories of parameters: (i) regulated by DHAonly (e.g., Cd36, Fig 1Dtop left); (ii) regulated by EPA only (e.g., Notch2, Fig 1Dtop right); (iii) regulated similarly by DHA and EPA (e.g., Cx3Cr1, Fig 1Dbottom left); (iv) not regulated by either DHA or EPA (e.g., Egfr, Fig 1Dbottom right). Although there was a large overlap between the effects of each ω3 PUFA, overall, DHA showed stronger effects than EPA in restoring alterations caused by WD.Specifically, while both EPA and DHA showed similar effects on19% of the genes affected by disease, DHA alone reversed moregenes (11%) than EPA alone (3%), (Fig 1B and C ).In line with this result, focusing on genes regulated by both fatty acids (DHA and ▸Figure 1.NASH mouse model outlines all expression/omics data, DHA/EPA treatment effects on outcome.
A All omics data collected and shown in Fig 1Abar graph and its associated table was acquired using samples ( N=8/treatment group) from a preclinical NASH prevention study previously described (Depner et al ,2013 a,b; Lytle et al ,2015 ).

Thus, the first step of transcriptome analysis indicated that DHA had a strongereffect than EPA in reversing damage inflicted by WD on the liverpotentially by restoring mitochondrial function and inhibitinginflammation. In the second largest omics data set, represented by lipidomes, we did not see differences in the number of lipids regulated by DHAor EPA and ω3 PUFA restored most lipids impaired by WD (Fig 1A and C ).However, we detected a significantly stronger effect on lipids regulated by DHA vs.by EPA (Fig EV1C ).Analysis of anthro- pometric features and plasma biochemicals also showed a more pro-nounced effect by DHA than EPA, as we previously reported(Depner et al,2013a ; Fig 1A).Overall, DHA demonstrated stronger effects than EPA in reversing WD-induced changes in both geneexpression (Fig EV1D ) and lipid concentrations.
Mapping effects of ω3PUFA onto multi-omic network model of NASH and its cellular components To investigate how changes in different omics data relate to each other and which of the effects are contributing to the effects of ω3 PUFA, we have reconstructed a multi-omic network model ofNAFLD/NASH and mapped ω3 PUFA effects into this model (Fig EV2A ). After filtering out data features that did not pass statisti- cal (Dong et al,2015 ) and causality (Yambartsev et al,2016 ) criteria thresholds (see Materials and Methods ), the multi-omic network consisted of 6,743 nodes connected by 80,811 edges.Specifically,the network included 6,346 gene transcripts, 5 anthropometricnodes, 11 plasma biochemicals, 357 lipids, and 24 metabolites(Fig 2A).
We next identified clusters (sub-networks) and using func- tional enrichment analyses found that different subnetworks wereenriched in different pathways, including mitochondrial organiza-tion, myeloid leukocyte activation, cell and mitochondrial mem-brane fluidity, remodeling, signaling, and energy metabolism. It alsoincluded processes such as macromolecule catabolic and fatty acidmetabolic processes (Fig 2A, Dataset EV1b).Multiple cell types in the liver contribute to NASH pathogenesis (Ramachandran et al,2019 ; Xiong et al,2019 ; Seidman et al,2020 ) but which cells are responding to DHA treatment has not been com-prehensively studied.Therefore, we mapped genes regulated by ω3 PUFA to cell type information using a previously published singlecell RNA-seq dataset generated from diet-induced NASH mouselivers (Xiong et al,2019 ).
Among different cell types, most of the ω3 PUFA-regulated genes were assigned to one of the two majorhepatic macrophage subpopulations including NASH-associatedmacrophages (NAM, 1,455 genes) and Kupffer-like cells (KC, 585genes), named according to the previous study (Xiong et al,2019 ). These were followed by hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and hepaticstellate cells (522, 365, and 192 genes respectively; Fig 2B).In line with our initial observation (Fig 1A), we found that DHA reversed expression of a larger number of genes than EPA, irrespectively ofthe cell type (Fig 2B).As a next step, we wanted to ensure that our model (i.e., multi- omic network enhanced with information about cell type assign-ment) is consistent with known effects of ω3 PUFA on NASH.
For this, we analyzed connectivity related topological network proper-ties, known as bipartite betweenness centrality (BiBC) that wasshown by us (Morgun et al,2015 ;L iet al,2022 ) and others (Lam et al ,2021 ) as a metric reflective of causal relationships between nodes in a co-variation network. High ranked BiBC nodes representparameters mediating impact of one part (e.g., module/cluster) of anetwork on another (Morgun et al,2015 ;L iet al,2022 ).Thus, we calculated cell –cell interaction BiBC based on the expression of genes assigned to different cells and affected or not by ω3 PUFA in NASH multi-omic network (Fig EV2B ).The results showed that DHA regulated genes had higher BiBCs than those regulated only byEPA or unaffected by either fatty acid (Fig 2C; Fig EV2C ).This result is in line with our previous observations of DHA being more potentthan EPA in improving NASH (Lytle et al,2017 ).
This result supported the general validity of the transcriptomic part of our network, thus, we asked which of the lipids/metabolitesmay have major contribution to cell –cell interactions in NASH. For this analysis, in addition to BiBC we accounted for node degree asthis topological property has been the most prevalent networkparameter in computational biology (Sorrells & Johnson, 2015 ; Choobdar et al,2019 ) reflecting importance of the node in control- ling direct and indirect neighbors and therefore corresponding bio-logical function.Specifically, nodes of high degree (also called ▸Figure 2.Multi- omic network (NW) reconstructed to model NASH in vivo using the data from preventive model (see Fig EV2; Materials and Methods ).

Importantly, two out of the five lipids (Figs 2DandEV2D ) were triglycerides containing EPA and DHA (TG 58:11 and TG60:10) as acyl chains (Fig 2E). Only 7 other lipids out of 357 had similar chemical composition (i.e., TG containing EPA/DHA) weredetected by our lipidomic assay, thus making this finding being ran-dom virtually impossible ( P<0.0001).Thus, this analysis identified two lipids, which are drastically depleted in the liver during andhave protective effect reversing NASH (Burke et al ,1999 ; Jump et al ,2015 ; Frid /C19enet al ,2021 ).Although this result might be expected, it is nevertheless important as a “positive control” provid-ing additional confidence in our network.The other three lipids were phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) 36:3, PG 36:2 (cardiolipin precursors) and sphingomyelin (SM) d42:2, whichare both main membrane lipids (Fig EV2D ).
Since top inferences from this network validated key previously known molecularaspects of ω3 PUFA action in NASH liver we can rely on this model for inference of new yet undiscovered aspects of this process. Combining the NASH network with the meta-analysis of liver cancer identifies betacellulin as a key pathogenic regulator ofNASH inhibited by DHA NASH can progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer in humans (Samuel & Shulman, 2018 ; Anstee et al ,2019 ; Pfister et al ,2021 ).Further- more, this was also shown in the mouse model used in this study(Chen et al,2021 ).Although ω3 PUFA have been studied as a poten- tial prevention strategy for colorectal cancer progression and othercancers (Van Blarigan et al,2018 ; Dierge et al,2021 ), there is still little understanding which cancer pathways can be inhibited bythese fatty acids.
Thus, as a next step, we mapped the molecularmodel of transcriptome alterations by DHA in liver tissue (Fig 2A) to transcriptomic alterations in human liver cancer. For this, we firstperformed a meta-analysis of human liver cancers (7 transcriptomicdatasets with a total of 544 tumor [Hepatocellular carcinoma andCholangiocarcinoma], 260 non-tumor, and 32 healthy patient liver samples) and established which genes were expressed concordantlyby cancer and WD-induced alterations in our preclinicalmouse model (Fig EV3A , Dataset EV2).Among 2,080 concordantly expressed genes between NASH and cancer, 22% (456 genes), 10%(221 genes) and 3% (56 genes) were reversed by DHA and EPA,DHA alone and EPA alone, respectively (Fig 3A left panel, Dataset EV3).
While the current mouse study was designed to assess the effects of ω3 PUFA on preventing NASH (Prevention study), in another study (Lytle et al,2017 ) we evaluated liver transcriptomes of DHA-treated mice with already established NASH (Treatmentstudy). In this case, we observed that treatment effects of DHAcover /C2454% (361 out of 677genes) of its preventive effects relevant for human liver cancer (Fig 3Aright panel).These results suggest that DHA can potentially be used as cancer preventive strategy inpatients with already established NAFLD/NASH.Next, we asked which of the molecular pathways regulated in cancer and reversed by DHA in mice may mediate beneficial effectsof DHA.For this, we combined gene enrichment analysis with BiBCto focus on genes with the largest impact on cell –cell interactions (see details in Materials and Methods ).
The top enriched pathway was Oxidative Phosphorylation with the well-known pathwayssuch as TGF βand p53 signaling being enriched to a lesser extent (Fig EV3B ). One pathway, however, that stood out as highly enriched was the ERBB signaling pathway; it was also top ranked inmediating DHA-driven cell –cell interactions (i.e., BiBC; Figs 3Band EV3C ).ERBBs are known homologs of EGFR, which are activated through binding to EGF and related members of the EGF family ofgrowth factors.These include EGF-like ligands or cytokines that arecomprised of at least 10 proteins including betacellulin, trans-forming growth factor-alpha (TGF- α), amphiregulin, HB-EGF, epire- gulin, and neuregulins and the various other heregulins (Olayioyeet al,2000 ; Wieduwilt & Moasser, 2008 ; Chen et al,2016 ).
Using our multi-omic network (including DHA affected and not affected genes in NASH), we ranked genes from the ERBB pathwaybased on their potential capacity to mediate effects of DHA andidentified betacellulin (BTC), an alternative ligand of EGFR(Fig EV4A ), as a top gene among the important genes (Grb2, Gsk3 Gsk3 β/α, and Cbl) in the pathway (Fig 3C). Interestingly, EGFR itself, although not regulated by DHA was the second best potentialregulatory gene for this pathway in NASH.To ensure statistical ▸Figure 3.Combining NASH network with meta- analysis of liver cancer identifies betacellulin as a key pathogenic regulator downregulated by DHA.A The heatmap of genes from human liver cancer meta- analysis ordered by corresponding genes from the mouse NASH on the effect of EPA and DHA on prevention and treatment of NASH in mice (Depner et al ,2013 a; Lytle et al ,2017 ).

We next confirmed that Btc gene expression was increased in other models of NASH, liver cancer and fibrosis including a chemi-cally induced disease (Green et al ,2022 ; Hammad et al ,2023 ; FigEV4B ), and it was downregulated by both EPA and DHA in our prevention model, albeit DHA had a stronger effect than EPA(Fig3D, left panel). In agreement with mouse models, Btc gene expression was increased in human hepatic carcinoma meta-analysis (Fig 3E) and in human NASH in two studies (Ahrens et al ,2013 ; Fujiwara et al ,2022 ; Fig 3F, Dataset EV4).Importantly, EPA +DHA treat- ment of patients with NASH for one year resulted in a significantdecrease of Btc gene expression (Fig 3F).BTC promotes NASH fibrosis via activating hepatic stellate cells to produce TGF β-2 Given that BTC was predicted as a new target, central for effects of DHA on NASH, we next verified which cell types express BTC andits receptor (EGFR).
For this, we integrated the network with avail-able interaction information from ligand –receptor database (Abuges- saisa et al ,2021 ) and single cell RNA-seq data (Xiong et al ,2019 ; FigEV4A ). We observed that cholangiocytes were the primary pop- ulation of cells expressing BTC (Fig EV4A ).Although its source is restricted to cholangiocytes, BTC’s role as a secreted growth factorindicates it can act on many different types of neighboring cells(e.g., hepatocytes, macrophages, hepatic stellate cells and others)that express EGFR/ERBBs (Fig EV4A and B ).Among different liver cell types which can respond to BTC and proliferate during NASH progression, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs),frequently called mesenchymal cells in humans (Ramachandranet al,2019 ; Carter & Friedman, 2022 ) produce collagens and repre- sent a major contributor to hepatic fibrosis.
Indeed, the number ofmesenchymal cells counted in humans with cirrhosis is markedly higher than those of healthy livers (Appendix Fig S1C). Importantly, DHA prevents and reverses fibrosis in a NASH mouse model(Depner et al,2013a ; Lytle et al,2015 ) and decreases expression of two out of three collagen encoding genes (COL1A1, COL1A2,COL4A1) that are upregulated in liver cancer and NASH (AppendixFigS1D).Therefore, we next tested effects of BTC on human hepatic stellate cells using the LX2 cell line (Xu et al,2005 ).LX2 cells were grown and pretreated with and without BTC using EGF as a growth factor positive control.LX2 growth was significantly increased byBTC (Fig 4A) and to a similar extent as was observed for EGF (Appendix Fig S1E).Moreover, we observed increased collagen staining (Sirius red) in cells treated with BTC (Fig 4B).We next performed a RNASeq transcriptomic analysis of LX2 cells treated with BTC and compared it to genes regulated by DHAin vivo .
We found 63 genes upregulated by BTC and downregulated by DHA and 16 genes downregulated by BTC and upregulated byDHA. Among the enriched pathways for the set of genes inducedby BTC and repressed by DHA were transcripts involved in cellgrowth including ERBB signaling (Fig 4C, Appendix Fig S1F–H, Dataset EV5).Strikingly, TGFB2 was the only gene found in com- mon across several enriched categories.Moreover, expression ofTGFB2, but not TGFB1 was increased by BTC in vitro (Fig 4D, Appendix Fig S1G), repressed by DHA in both prevention and treat- ment mouse studies (Fig 4E), and increased in human liver cancer meta-analysis (Fig 4F).A recent study demonstrated that TGF β-2, but not TGF β-1 has a critical non-redundant role in promoting lung and liver fibrosis (Sun et al,2021 ).Therefore, we hypothesized that downstream effects of reduction of BTC by DHA can be explainedby reduction of TGF β-2.
For this, using publicly available in vitro data on TGF β-2 effects and our in vivo data, we evaluated which genes regulated by DHA were regulated in the opposite directionby TGF β-2 (Dataset EV6). We found 62 genes upregulated by TGFβ-2 and downregulated by DHA and another 62 genes downre- gulated by TGF β-2 and upregulated by DHA.DHA downregulated/ TGFβ-2-upregulated genes were highly enriched for production of collagen trimers and extracellular matrix organization (Fig 4G) ▸Figure 4.Hepatic stellate cell (LX 2) proliferation could promote fibrosis via BTC- TGFβ-2, reversed by DHA.AL X 2cell proliferation assay after treatment with BTC, 0–25ng/ml (left panel, N=6individual experiments).Fold change in DNA concentration after treatment with BTC 0–10ng/ml (right panel, N=3experiments).Green bar in each plot is untreated control.

/C2112023 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 9of21Jyothi Padiadpu et al EMBO Molecular Medicine while genes downregulated by TGF β-2 and reversed by DHA were enriched for mitochondrial inner membrane and other mitochond-rially related functions (Fig 4H). Altogether these results suggest that one of a key mechanism of fibrosis reduction by DHA isachieved through an inhibition of BTC and a consequent reductionof HSCs proliferation and TGF β-2-induced collagen production (Sun et al,2021 ).TLR-dependent inflammatory processes in NASH are exacerbated by BTC Our results from stellate cells support that inhibition of BTC by DHA would explain reduction of fibrosis and improvement of mitochon-drial function.However, the reduction in inflammatory pathwaysand macrophage gene expression, another major effect of DHA weobserved (Figs 1and2), could not be explained by effects of BTC on stellate cells.
Furthermore, EGFR deficiency specifically in macro-phages has been shown to attenuate liver cancer in a mouse model(Lanaya et al,2014 ). Finally, we have previously reported that sys- temic levels of TLR2 ligands are decreased by DHA (Lytleet al ,2015 ; Appendix Fig S2A).These results, along with a well- known fact that a genetic deficiency of microbiota sensors (TLR2and TLR4) attenuates NASH (Spruss et al,2009 ; Miura et al,2013 ; Wu et al ,2020 ), indicate that a reduction in TLR2 and/or TLR4 ligand levels by DHA might interact with the reduction of BTC inpreventing the disease.While different receptors for BTC are widelydistributed across different liver cell types (Appendix Fig S1B and S2B), TLR2 and TLR4 are predominantly expressed by macrophages in the liver (Appendix Fig S2C).Taken together, our next question was: which processes regu- lated by DHA in the liver can be explained by the effects of BTC andTLR2/4 agonists on macrophages?
We also asked whether BTCmodulates TLR2/4-dependent immune stimulation in macrophages.To answer these questions, we differentiated the human monocytecell line (THP-1) to a macrophage-like phenotype and stimulatedwith BTC, LPS (TLR4 ligand) and PGN (TLR2 ligand) and comparedglobal gene expression in these cells to cells stimulated with TLR2/4ligands only or unstimulated control cells (Appendix Fig S2D, Dataset EV7).To investigate a potential interaction effect, we tested a range of concentrations of BTC and TLR-agonists evaluating expression of IL-8, and CCL2 (MCP-1) expression, well-known targets of BTC(Lanaya et al ,2014 ; Shi et al ,2014 ) and TLR-agonists (Seki et al ,2007 ; Spruss et al ,2009 ; Miura et al ,2013 ;W u et al ,2020 ) and chose the lowest doses that induces their expression (AppendixFigS2E and F). We next performed transcriptomic analysis of THP-1 cells treated with BTC-LPS-PGN and compared it to genes regulatedby DHA in vivo .
We found 179 genes upregulated by BTC-LPS-PGN and downregulated by DHA and 285 genes downregulated by BTC-LPS-PGN and upregulated by DHA (Fig 5A). Genes upregulated by BTC-LPS-PGN were enriched for several pathways related to mono-cyte/macrophage related immune functions, the cell cycle, and col-lagen binding.Among the most enriched categories for thedownregulated genes were mitochondrion, NAD metabolic process,and endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Fig 5B–G).To assess the relative contribution of BTC and of TLR2/4 ago- nists to the observed combined functional effect, we calculated asummary metric for each pathway (see Materials and Methods ) and compared their values between each treatment group (Fig 5D).
To check if the expected effects of BTC are present in macro- phages, we first verified expression of EGFR/cell cycle andepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways and observedtheir increase among the categories upregulated by BTC alone andin combination with TLR agonists (Fig 5E). Analysis of the downre- gulated pathways showed that in combination with TLR ligandsBTC inhibited expression of genes involved in mitochondrial func-tions (TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, Appendix Fig S2G) and NAD metabolic functions (critical pathways operating in mitochon-dria; Samuel & Shulman, 2018 ; Simo ˜eset al,2018 ; Xie et al,2020 ; Fig5F).As for the upregulated pathways, we observed diverse immune functions such as ‘innate immune response’, ‘regulation ofinterferon-gamma signaling’ with a similar or slightly enhancedexpression of genes when BTC was added with TLR2/4 agonists(Fig 5G, Appendix Fig S2H).However, some genes showed clear interactions between BTC and TLR-agonists.
For example, IL1B wasupregulated by TLR2/4 agonists and slightly increased by BTC, butCSF1, a classical factor of macrophage growth and proliferation ▸Figure 5.

Interestingly, while there was a trend for BTC increasing transcript levels of ITG α6 and ITG α9 and TLR2/4 agonists of ITG α1, only the combination of BTC with TLR-agonists signifi- cantly induced expression of all three integrins (Fig 5J, Appendix FigS2I). Notably, the integrin pathway was not regulated by TLR2/ 4 agonists alone suggesting a possible unique role of the crosstalkbetween EGFR and TLR pathways in controlling fibrosis-relatedmolecular function in macrophages.Potential mechanism of BTC regulation by ω3fatty acids As a last step of this study, we sought to identify potential upstream regulators (transcription factors, TF) that could be targets of ω3 PUFA in control of betacellulin and its downstream processes.Forthis, we first established BTC-downstream profile by searching inthe network genes that were regulated by BTC in vitro (Figs 4Cand 5B–D) and by ω3 PUFA in the NASH mouse model (Fig 2A) in the opposite directions.
We found 150 genes (62 up and 88 down regu-lated by BTC) and defined them as ω3-controlled BTC-regulated genes. Next, we investigated which genes (and which transcriptionfactors among them) might mediate effects of ω3 PUFA on BTC- regulated genes.First, we ranked genes using the network degreeand BiBC between ω3 PUFA and BTC-regulated genes (Fig EV5A ).Among the 41 top-ranked genes, we found three transcription fac-tors with two of them (Foxo3 and Kdm5d) expressed in cholangio-cytes (the only expressing BTC in the liver).Further investigation ofbinding motifs identified that only Foxo3 had a motif in the Btc pro-moter (Fig EV5B ), suggesting that regulation of this TF by ω3 PUFA can be implicated in the regulation of BTC.Interestingly, Foxo3 is awell-known suppressor of oncogenesis (Liu et al ,2018 ; Tsuji et al,2021 ), and we found that this TF is downregulated by WD and upregulated by ω3 PUFA in mice (Fig EV5C ).
Discussion For many metabolic diseases such as diabetes (Jermendy et al , 2018 ; Dahl /C19enet al ,2021 ), atherosclerosis (Bhatt et al ,2019 ), and obesity (Jastreboff et al,2022 ) there are highly efficient drugs that treat and/or prevent development of these diseases. The only fre-quent representative of metabolic diseases that still lack pharmaco-logical agents that would pass clinical trials is NAFLD/NASH.Asthis disease is often called “fatty liver”, most of attempted treat-ments target reduction of liver fat (Rinella, 2015 ).However, these treatments cannot resolve liver fibrosis, which is a more resistantaspect of the pathogenesis of this disease (Wattacheril et al,2018 ).Fibrosis is the main cause of liver failure in patients with NASH andalso precedes and leads to development of liver cancer (Ansteeet al,2019 ; Pfister et al,2021 ).
Therefore, revealing the mechanisms of action of DHA that reduce fibrosis in a preclinical mouse modelmay aid in the rational use of ω3 PUFA or help in developing new drugs that would act upon the same cellular/molecular targets(Jump et al,2015 ).In this study, we identified betacellulin (BTC), one of the less studied ligands of EGFR, as a master regulator whose reduction byDHA potentially leads to prevention/treatment of fibrosis. Indeed,we revealed that BTC induces the TGF β-2, a critical contributor to liver fibrosis via collagen production by hepatic stellate cells (Drop-mann et al,2016 ).Moreover, in combination with TLR 2/4-agonists (also reduced by DHA), BTC induces integrin pathway in macro-phages, the cell type in the liver most affected by DHA treatmentand well-known to be involved in pathogenesis of fibrosis in differ-ent organs (Wynn & Vannella, 2016 ).
Thus, BTC represents a candi- date master regulator inducing two most important factors(collagens and integrins) contributing to liver fibrosis and conse-quently promoting liver cancer. In addition to its effect on fibrosis, reduction of BTC seems to be also mediating another important effect of DHA, which is improve-ment of mitochondrial function-related pathways.Indeed, mitochondrial damage is widely reported in NAFLD/ NASH and its improvement by DHA is clearly seen even at the ini-tial stage of our analysis (Fig 1E) indicating a strong impact of DHA on this pathway.Accordingly, BTC in combination with microbiotaderived stimulation (represented by TLR agonists) has a negativeeffect on the expression of genes involved in mitochondrialfunctions.Another robust effect of DHA observed at the initial step of our analysis was the inhibition of inflammation.
Not surprisingly, adeeper investigation into this phenomenon led us to potential effectsof DHA on microbiota-related molecules and on hepatic macro-phages involved in sensing microbes. In fact, network analysis com-bined with scRNAseq data pointed to macrophages as main cellulartargets of DHA in the liver (Fig 2B).Macrophages are also the pri- mary cells in the liver that express both TLR 2/4 (AppendixFigS2C) whose microbiota-derived agonists are decreased by DHA (Appendix Fig S2A; Lytle et al,2015 ).This was an important obser- vation considering that deficiency of either TLR2 or TLR4 attenuatesseverity of NADFL/NASH in mouse models (Spruss et al ,2009 ; Miura et al,2013 ;W u et al,2020 ).In contrast to TLRs, EGFR and other receptors that BTC binds are widely expressed across most cells in liver including macrophages.Moreover, EGFR deficiency in macrophages, but not in hepatocyteswas shown to attenuate NASH in mice (Lanaya et al,2014 ).
Thus, it is plausible that the impact of DHA on macrophage related to NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis can be explained by the factthat DHA simultaneously limits cell access to BTC and TLR2/4 ago-nists. Moreover, despite the limitations of our cell culture systemand the difficulty of transition from mice to humans, we observedthat BTC combined with TLR 2/4 agonists induce the integrin sig-naling pathway which was inhibited by DHA in the liver.Inspectingindividual genes revealed that all detected integrins (ITG α 1,6,9— Fig5J, Appendix Fig S2I) required all three compounds for induc- tion except for ITG β1 that increased only with only BTC stimulation in THP-1 cells.Interestingly, ITG β1 was also increased by BTC in hepatic stellate cells (Appendix Fig S1H).Of note, proteins coded to ITGαs and ITG βs form a complex that binds collagens (Bourgot et al,2020 ).Accordingly, blocking integrin signals has been shown to attenuate fibrosis (Agarwal, 2014 ; Rahman et al ,2022 ).
Hence, our results taken together with already existing literature aboutother pathologies (Bourgot et al ,2020 ) suggest that DHA inhibits the macrophage contribution to fibrosis by simultaneously 12of21 EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 /C2112023 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Jyothi Padiadpu et al inhibiting microbiota-derived signals and BTC. Furthermore, while BTC is a new player in this arena, the role of microbiota-derived sig-nals in activating a profibrotic program in macrophages has beenreported for different diseases in a few organs (He et al,2021 ; Costa et al,2022 ).Leveraging complex multi-omic and single cell data (Xiong et al,2019 ) and using a systems approach, our study constructed a statistical network model of cell –cell interactions affected by DHA (Fig EV4A ).
More importantly, network cause –effect related infor- mation flow (degree and BiBC) combined with a ligand –receptor database (Abugessaisa et al ,2021 ; Fig EV4A ) allowed us to infer that a candidate master regulator molecule (BTC) produced by onecell (cholangiocytes) acts upon several other cells. DHA may affectseveral cell types involved in liver fibrosis.Our study, however,reveals that BTC inhibition by DHA simultaneously disrupts theintegrin pathway in macrophages and TGF β-2-driven collagen pro- duction by hepatic stellate cells, two processes that synergize in thedevelopment of liver fibrosis.Thus, we propose that removal ofBTC and Tlr2/4 agonists prevents binding of integrins to collagenthat is required for the scar development.The main outcomes of our study, however, might be missing additional beneficial effects of DHA, especially those that are notrelated to BTC reduction and fibrosis.
This is because we focusedour investigations on cellular/molecular events relevant to NASHand its progression to liver cancer in humans. Specifically, whileour network analysis modeled NASH in mice, we used it as a firststep in identification of the most critical causal pathways upregu-lated in hepatic cancer meta-analysis and reversed by DHA.In thisanalysis we found ERBB as a top pathway with BTC being the top-ranked molecule in this pathway altered by DHA.Accordingly, ourin vitro investigations of human hepatic stellate cells demonstrated that BTC promotes cell growth, which was an expected finding con-sidering that BTC belongs to a family of growth factors (Olayioyeet al,2000 ; Wieduwilt & Moasser, 2008 ; Chen et al,2016 ).Thus, in addition to promoting fibrosis by upregulation of TGFB2 in stellatecells, it may also increase numbers of these collagen-producing cellsin the liver.
Furthermore, our gene expression analyses of effectspromoted by BTC in vitro and downregulated by DHA in the liver also support this growth function for BTC (Fig 4A), pointing to an activation of ERBB pathways, cell growth and even the epithelialmesenchymal transition. Dysregulation of these pathways are hall-marks of cancer (Dahlhoff et al ,2014 ; Lanaya et al ,2014 ; Chava et al,2022 ).The growth-promoting actions of BTC are known to be mediated by epidermal growth factor receptors (ERBBs), namelyERBB1 (EGFR; Chava et al ,2022 ), ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4.In liver however, the mechanism for BTC dependent cell proliferationhas not been elucidated.The BTC-EGFR-ERBB4 pathway in pancre-atic ductal adenocarcinoma has been well established by severalgroups and a BTC knock out can partially rescue the cancer progres-sion (Hedegger et al,2020 ).In the in vivo NASH model, we have a significant reversal of ERBB4 expression by DHA (AppendixFigS2B).
Furthermore, DHA also inhibits GRB2 and GSK3 β, genes which are downstream in the ERBB signaling pathway found in ourliver cancer meta-analysis (Fig 3A and C ) and known to promote multiple types of cancers (He et al,2021 ). These results suggest that DHA, besides its main effect as BTC reduction, might also inhibitresidual activation of ERBB pathway via BTC-unrelated mecha-nisms.In addition, 49 EMT related genes, including the TGF β-2mediated (Dropmann et al,2016 ) SMAD-EMT-cancer pathway were reversed by DHA treatments (Fig 3A).Therefore, our results suggest that the DHA attenuation of BTC-TGF β-2-dependent molecular events might not be limited to reversal of fibrosis in NASH (Lytleet al,2015 ) but also has a promise in preventing NASH’s progres- sion into liver cancer.
While investigating regulatory events upstream of BTC, we found FOXO3, a transcription factor with well-established function oftumor suppression (Liu et al,2018 ; Tsuji et al,2021 ), as a probable mediator of inhibitory effects of omega 3 fatty acids on BTC. Theseresults provide additional details for understanding the molecularmechanism omega 3 action in the liver and contribute to rationaleto use them for liver cancer prevention.Clinical trials using EPA and/or DHA in NAFLD/NASH therapy have shown mixed, but promising results with significant improve-ment with disease severity, including hepatosteatosis and liverinjury (Hodson et al ,2017 ;Z o¨hrer et al ,2017 ; Musa-Veloso et al , 2018 ; Okada et al,2018 ; Tobin et al,2018 ;ˇSm/C19ıdet al,2022 ).
Unfor- tunately, these studies did not address whether patients that did notrespond to therapy represent a cellular/molecular subtype ofNAFLD that is not treatable only by ω3 PUFA or perhaps have such severe disease that they are unlikely to respond to any therapeuticagent. Despite the novelty and importance of our findings several ques- tions remain to be investigated.For example, to evaluate the relativecontribution of down regulation of BTC by DHA for treatment ofNASH and prevention of cancer, experiments using mouse modelsare warranted.In conclusion, with the discovery of BTC as a candidate to be one of the key mediators of ω3 PUFA therapeutic effects, our study opens a new avenue for investigation of NAFLD/NASH.In additionto finding new mechanisms of action of DHA, this study is the firstto demonstrate that BTC can induce TGF β-2 and synergize with microbial signals in the induction of integrins.
Thus, while few ear-lier studies (Moon et al,2006 ) showed increase of BTC in the liver tumors, our robust meta-analysis coupled with evidence for causalcontributions shed a new light to this molecule in the pathogenesisof this cancer. Moreover, BTC’s role in human NAFLD/NASH isentirely uncharted territory.Therefore, future studies should investi-gate if BTC-triggered gene expression signatures can serve as bio-markers guiding personalized ω3 PUFA therapy, as targets of new NAFLD/NASH drugs, and finally as a predictors of hepatic cancerrisk in humans.Materials and Methods Animals and diets Study design for DHA mediated NASH prevention and remission in Male Ldlr/C0//C0mice.This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recom- mendations in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory animals ofthe National Institutes of Health.
All procedures for the use and careof animals for laboratory research were approved by the Institu-tional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon state University(Permit number: A3229-01). Anthropometric, plasma and liver sam-ples used in this study were obtained from our previously published /C2112023 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 13of21Jyothi Padiadpu et al EMBO Molecular Medicine NASH prevention and treatment studies (Depner et al,2013a ; Lytle et al,2015 ).Briefly, male mice (B6:129S7- LdlrtmHer /j, stock# 002207) were purchased from Jackson Labs and were group housed (4 mice/cage; n=8 mice per group) and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle.Mice were acclimatized to the Oregon State University LinusPauling science center vivarium for 2 weeks before proceeding withthe experiments.NASH prevention study This study was designed to determine if EPA and DHA differed intheir capacity to prevent western diet-induced NASH (Depneret al ,2013a ).
Mice consumed the one of the following 5 diets, ad libitum for 16 weeks; each group consisted of 8 male mice. Purina chow 5001 consisting of 13.5% energy as fat and 58.0% energy ascarbohydrates was used as the Reference diet (RD).The westerndiet (WD) was obtained from Research Diets (12709B) and used toinduce NASH.The WD consisted of 17% energy as protein, 43%energy as carbohydrate, and 41% energy as fat; cholesterol was at0.2% wt:wt and does not contain either EPA or DHA (Depneret al ,2013a ).The WD was supplemented with olive oil (WDO), eicosapentaenoic acid (WD +EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (WD + DHA), or both EPA and EHA (WD +EPA+DHA).EPA and DHA were added to the diets to yield 2% of total calories; for theEPA+DHA, each was added to yield 1% of total calories, i.e.2% total calories as C 20-22 ω3 PUFA.Olive oil was added to the WD to have a uniform level of fat energy in all the WDs.
Preliminary stud-ies established that the addition of Olive oil had no effect on diet-induced fatty liver disease in Ldlr /C0//C0mice. EPA was purchased from Futurebiotics as Newharvest EPA, a DuPont product, while DHAwas obtained as a generous gift from DSM, formally Martek Biosci-ence).The amount of EPA or DHA added to the diets is equivalentto the amount prescribed for treating patients for hypertriglyceri-demia (Harris et al,1997 ; Davidson et al,2007 ).At the end of the 16-week feeding trial, mice were euthanized with CO 2, blood (RBC and plasma) and liver were collected and stored at /C080°C for later extractions of RNA, lipids, proteins.NASH treatment study This study was designed to assess the capacity of DHA to reversethe effects of WD-induced NASH (Lytle et al,2017 ).As such, male Ldlr /C0//C0mice were fed the WD for 22 weeks.These mice were sepa- rated into two groups: one group was maintained on a WD +olive oil, with the other group was maintained on the WD +DHA.
The diet composition was as described above for the prevention study.Both groups were euthanized after 8 weeks of these diets. A controlgroup was maintained on the RD for 30 weeks.At the end of thestudy, mice were euthanized, and samples collected and processedas above.Liver histology Approximately 100 mg of fresh mouse liver from each animal was fixed in buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, sliced and stainedwith hematoxylin –eosin (H & E), trichrome or Picro Sirius red (PCR; Nationwide Histology, Veradale, WA).Each slide contained 2 –4 liver slices.Histological analysis and scoring for microsteatosis andmacrosteatosis, inflammation (leukocytes) and fibrosis were pro-vided by two investigators using the modified Kleiner scoringsystem established for mouse models of NAFLD as described previ- ously (Garcia-Jaramillo et al ,2019 ).Histological samples were blinded as to diet, timepoint and diet.
Digital images were takenwith a Nikon Eclipse 6 microscope and digital camera (Mpixel) andNIS-BR Elements imaging software (v21.1; www.nikonmetrology. com).Digital images taken at 400 ×magnification were used for steatosis scoring.An effort was made to place the central vein of alobule at one of the corners of the image so that each image coveredat least one-quarter of that lobule, including all three zones of thehepatic lobule.Steatosis was objectively analyzed as the averagepercent surface area occupied by vacuoles using the image analysissoftware, ImageJ ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ).Two images were taken of H&E-stained sections at 400 ×and the percent of affected surface area was calculated for each.The two values were thenaveraged.Steatosis was subjectively analyzed as the percent ofaffected surface area observed on H&E-stained slides at 100 ×(10× objective) and 400 ×magnifications.
Vacuolization was character- ized as macro vesicular, in which vacuoles displace hepatocytenuclei, or micro vesicular. Macro vesicular and micro vesicular stea-tosis were scored separately.Severity was scored using the scale: 0(0%), 1 ( >5% but <33%), 2 ( >33% but <66%), 3 ( >66%).When possible, the distribution of vacuoles was described as peri-central, midzonal, or periportal.Inflammation was defined as intra-lobular inflammatory foci of at least 5 leukocytes associated withdisruption of hepatic plates or increased hepatocellular eosinophilia.Inflammation scores were calculated as the total number of clustersaveraged over 5 fields in H&E-stained tissues examined at 100 × (total number of clusters in 3.1 mm 2).The following scale was used: normal 0 ( <0.5 foci), slight 1 ( <0.5–1 foci), moderate 2 (1 –2 foci), severe 3 ( >2 foci).Fibrosis was also objectively quantified as percent surface area occupied by Sirius Red-stained collagen byimage analysis using ImageJ.
Two images were taken at 100 ×from the liver section of each mouse and the calculated percentage areaswere averaged. Fibrosis was subjectively analyzed to determineseverity and distribution patterns, perisinusoidal, periportal, peri-central, or bridging.The following scale was used: absent (0), mild(1), moderate (2), or severe (3).Cell culture LX2 cells were obtained from SL Friedman (Mount Sinai Medical School; Xu et al ,2005 ).LX2 cells are activated human hepatic stellate cells; they were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCScontaining penicillin and streptomycin.Cells were plated onto100 mm plastic petri dishes ∼100,000 cells/plate and treated with fatty acids (at 50 μM) in endotoxin-free BSA (at 20 μM) during the growth phase.Fatty acids [oleic acid (18:1 ω9) and DHA (22:6, ω3); Nu-Chek Prep] were used at 50 μM for 2 –48-h cycle treatments.After this pre-treatment, cells were trypsinized,washed in PBS, counted and plated at 3,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate.
Cells were fed DMEM with 1% FCS without or withbetacellulin (human recombinant betacellulin [BTC], R&D Sys-tems) for 72 h; the concentration ranged from 1.25 to 25 ng/ml.At the completion of BTC treatment, media was removed, washedwith PBS and DNA/well was quantified using the CyQuant cellproliferation assay (Thermofisher); DNA fluoresces was quantified(excitation at 485 nm & emission at 530 nm). This experimentwas repeated 3 times.14of21 EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 /C2112023 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Jyothi Padiadpu et al Collagen production Pico Sirius red quantitation of collagen production: Cells werepretreated with fatty acids as described above, trypsinized, countedand plated onto 12-well cell culture plates at 80,000 cells/well inDMEM +1% FCS and treated without and with 20 μg/ml BTC for 72 h.At the end of treatment, media was removed, cells werewashed with PBS and stained with pico Sirius Red (Abcam) for 2 hat room temperature.
After staining cells were washed with anacetic acid solution, photographed and the stain was removed using50 mM NaOH. The level of staining per well was quantified at540 nm.The level of protein/well was quantified after solubilizingthe protein in 50 mM NaOH and using the Pierce BSA kit.Thisexperiment was repeated 4 times.Cell viability Alamar Blue (Creative Labs) assessment of cell vitality (NADH con-version to NAD +): Using the protocol described above, we assessed the vitality of cells after treatment with fatty acids and BTC.Alamarblue (50 μl/1.0 ml media) was added to the cells and fluorescence was measured at 590 nm 4 h after Alamar Blue addition.RNASeq RNA was extracted from LX2 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) as previ-ously described (Lytle et al,2015 ) from cells treated with fatty acids (oleic acid and DHA at 50 μM for 72 h) as described above.Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at 40,000 cells/well; and cells weretreated with fatty acids for 96 h as described above.
Afterward,media was removed, and cells were treated without and with BTCat 20 ng/ml for 72 h. Cells were harvested for RNA extraction(Trizol).cDNA was prepared for RNASeq analysis as described.THP- 1cells BTC and TLR co-stimulation THP-1 monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium adjusted tocontain 4.5 g/l glucose and supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Strep-tomycin, 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES.Forexperiments, monocytes were first seeded in 24 well plates at400,000 cells/well in 1 ml of complete medium with 50 ng/ml PMA(phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) to induce polarization, for 24 h.Then, attached cells were washed with sterile PBS to remove resid-ual serum and PMA containing media.Cells were stimulated with aTLR2 agonist at 40 ng/ml (PGN-BS, Invivogen, San Diego, CA),TLR4 agonist at 4 ng/ml (LPS-B5, Invivogen, San Diego, CA), BTCat 40 ng/ml (human recombinant Betacellulin protein, R&D Sys-tems, MN), or combinations of all for 6 h.
Treatments were pre-pared in serum-free semi-complete RPMI 1640 media (see above forother components) supplemented with 20 μM BSA and 50 μM BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene). Cells were lysed with 300 μl RLT buffer (Qiagen) and cell lysates were stored at /C080°C.Primers qRT–PCR data analysis THP-1 cells’ response to TLR and BTC stimulation was assessed byqRT–PCR (Appendix Table S1).Briefly, raw Cycle Threshold (CT) values from the StepOnePlus Real Time PCR instrument for genes ofinterest were normalized to C Tvalues of a housekeeping gene, TMEM59, by delta CTmethod and relativized by 2/C0ΔCT.Data werethen median normalized and Log 2transformed before being plotted in GraphPad Prism 9.RNA extraction and RNA sequencing library preparation RNA was extracted from cell lysates using the RNeasy Mini Kit andsubjected to a DNase treatment according to manufacturer’s proto-cols (Qiagen) then stored at /C080°C until further use.
mRNA libraries were prepared for sequencing with the Lexogen QuantSeq 3 0mRNA- Seq Library Prep Kit (FWD) HT for Illumina Sequencing platforms(Kit#k15.384) and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq at OregonState University. cDNA and qRT –PCR cDNA was prepared from 0.5 to 1 μg of RNA via reverse transcrip- tion using the qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix kit (Quantabio).qRT – PCR was performed for gene expression using the AzuraViewGreenFast qPCR Blue Mix HR (Azura Genomics).96-well plateswere prepared with 10 ng of cDNA in triplicate reactions for eachgene and sample and run on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlusReal Time PCR instrument.Sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) RNA libraries were prepared with the QuantSeq 3 0mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Lexogen) for the Apollo 324 NGS Library Prep Sys-tem and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq.
The sequences wereprocessed to remove the adapter, polyA and low-quality bases byBBTools ( https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/ ) using bbduk parameters of k =13, ktrim =r, forcetrimleft =12, useshortkmers = t, mink =5, qtrim =r, trimq =15, minlength =20. Then the reads were aligned to mouse genome and transcriptome (ENSEMBLNCBIM37) using Tophat (v2.1.1) with default parameters.The num-ber of reads per million for mouse liver genes were counted usingHTSeq (v 0.6.0) and quantile normalized.Cell lines sequencing/analysis was performed similarly, but with the bbduk parameters ofk=13, ktrim =r, forcetrimleft =11, useshortkmers =t, mink =5, qtrim =r, trimq =10, minlength =20.The reads were aligned to the human genome and transcriptome (Gencode v40) using STARv2.5.3a.BRB-ArrayTools was used to identify differentiallyexpressed genes between treatments.Metabolomes and lipidomes Data were prepared, and analysis was carried out from the NASHPrevention study and Treatment study.
Hepatic lipids and non-lipidmetabolites were extracted and subject to UPLC/MS/MS analysis aspreviously described (Garcia-Jaramillo et al,2019 ; Rodrigues et al, 2021 ) with minor modifications. Processed normalized data are available in Dataset EV8.Treatment categorization of omics data The genes and other parameters whose expressions or values aresignificantly changed by WD (FDR <10%) were considered for treatment effects.Out of these parameters and genes, thosethat have treatment effect reversal with a P-value <0.05 were cate- gorized as DHA if uniquely DHA (opposite to WD +O/ND & WD+DHA/WD +OP-value <0.05), uniquely EPA (opposite to WD+O/ND & WD +EPA/WD +OP-value <0.05), similar in both EPA&DHA (opposite to WD +O/ND & both WD +EPA/ WD+O and WD +DHA/WD +O,P-value <0.05) and with no /C2112023 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 15of21Jyothi Padiadpu et al EMBO Molecular Medicine treatment effect (NA; with both WD +EPA/WD +O and WD+DHA/WD +O,P-value >0.05).
To be consistent with many previous studies, the treatment effects were also tested in the combi-nation of preventive treatment though not used further in the analy-sis (EPA +DHA; WD +EPA+DHA/WD +O,P-value <0.05). Reconstructing the NASH liver multi-omic network The network reconstruction was carried out as described in the pre-vious papers from our group with minor dataset specific modifica-tions (Dong et al ,2015 ,L i et al ,2022 ).The genes and other parameters whose expressions or values are significantly changedby WD (FDR <10%) were chosen for constructing the NASH net- work.First, from liver tissue between all pairs of genes (GE) andmetabolic parameters (phenotypes, P) spearman rank correlationswere calculated by pooling the samples per diet (WD +O, WD+EPA and WD +DHA).Meta-analysis was performed to retain edges with same sign of correlation coefficient in all threediets.
Edges were further filtered by the following criteria: individualP-value of correlation within each diet from pooled experiments <20%, combined Fisher’s P-value over diets from pooled experi- ments <5% and FDR cutoff of 10% for edges within tissues and for phenotypes and between lipidomic, metabolomic and plasma bio-chemicals and edges needed to satisfy principles of causality (i.e.,satisfied fold change relationship between the two partners in theWD+O vs. ND comparison).Next, correlations were calculated per diet for the experiment pairwise between parameters (GeneExpression +Lipidomic and Metabolomic data [LM]) and (P + LM).Finally, edges obtained from pooling were retained if they hadthe same sign of correlation coefficient as in 3 groups (3 diets,WD+O, WD +EPA and WD +DHA).False positive edges were removed (Yambartsev et al,2016 ) while pooling the different diets in the creation of the network.
The proportion of genes, metabolitesand lipids that made it to the final network (following statistical cut-offs) was determined after applying selection for significance in dif-ferentially expressed parameters in liver prior to applyingcorrelation cutoffs. Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing data analysisDatasets Single cell dataset (GSE129516) for mouse NASH model wasobtained from single cell RNA-sequence on non-parenchymal cellsof healthy vs.NASH mouse liver.These are then reanalyzed andused in our multi-omic network analysis to infer liver cell types.Human liver single cell RNA sequencing data (GSE136103) fromnormal and Cirrhosis patients were reanalyzed (Ramachandranet al,2019 ; Xiong et al,2019 ).scRNA sequencing analysis The raw gene expression matrix (UMI counts per gene per cell inthe liver tissue) was filtered, normalized, and clustered using a stan-dard Seurat version 3.1.0 in R [ https://www.R-project.org/ ] (Stuart et al,2019 ).
Cell and gene filtering were performed as mentioned in previous publications. During quality filtering, cells with a verysmall library size ( <5,000) and a very high ( >12%) mitochondrial genome transcripts were removed.The genes detected (UMI count>0) in less than three cells were also removed from further pro- cesses.Then log normalization and further clustering is performedusing standard Seurat package procedures.Principal component analysis was used to reduce dimensions that represent cell clusters.The number of components from this analysis used for the elbow ofa scree plot, which further aid in selecting the significant clusters.The different cell type clusters in a sample were visualized using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding of the principal compo-nents as implemented in Seurat.
The liver tissue specific cell-typeidentities for each cluster were determined manually using a com-piled panel of available immune and other cell specific markerexpression as per the previously published papers (Ramachandranet al,2019 ; Xiong et al,2019 ). Single cell RNA sequence for assignment of gene in the NASH network to a specific cell typeThe normalized UMI >1.0, with a fold change significantly and uniquely expressed genes in a cell specific cluster were thenassigned to that specific set of genes in the network to indicate theybelong to that specific cell type.It is the primary rule to assign agene to a cell type.Next, higher expression in the cell cluster (andoptional fold change (log 2FC>0.25, Pvalue<0.05) for a gene gets assigned with that specific cell type of the tissue.Here, additionally,ranking by average expression for each gene in the clusters helps todetermine its cluster specificity by the higher expression in that celltype than another in the whole tissue.
This is implemented for eval-uating the highest cell cluster average expression of a gene, amongall other cell clusters in network. Detecting subnetworks and functional enrichment Infomap ( mapequation.org ) was used to identify subnetworks using the default commands.Functional enrichment of clusters was thenperformed using metascape ( http://metascape.org ; Zhou et al,2019 ).Additionally single cell data overlay on NASH network as men- tioned above allowed the cell type specific gene sub clusters.Identifying of key nodes between subnetworks using BiBC analysis Analysis of networks was performed using the python packageNetworkX v2.2.Bipartite betweenness centrality (BiBC) was calcu-lated between all cell cluster pairs (66 in total) of the 12 clusters pre-viously identified based on single cell data overlay on NASHnetwork.The nodes were then ranked by their resulting BiBC andscaled to range of 0 –100.
BiBC was also calculated and scaled simi- larly pairwise between all genes and anthropometric data, betweenall genes and Lipidomic/Metabolomic data. Creation and analysis of random networks Random networks were created similar to as was described in Kaha-lehili et al (2020 ).Briefly, 5,000 Erdos-Renyi random networks were created, utilizing the same number of nodes and edges thatwere present in the real, reconstructed network.BiBC was calcu-lated both (i) between DHA controlled genes and anthropometricnodes and (ii) between DHA controlled genes and DHA controlledmetabolomic/lipidomic data.Plotly ( https://chart-studio.plotly.com/create/#/ ) was used to create the 2D contour histograms for visualization of the random network results.
Intrahepatic ligand –receptor interaction network The knowledgebase of ligand –receptor interaction information avail- able for mouse genes (Abugessaisa et al,2021 ), was overlayed on to 16of21 EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 /C2112023 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Jyothi Padiadpu et al reconstructed NASH Multiomics network genes. Additionally, this allowed the interrogation of ligand –receptor network with respect to each cell in the network that a gene can be represented as ligand orreceptor.Human liver cancer meta-analysis Human cancer data from hepatic cellular cancer (HCC) and cholan-giocytes cancer (CC) were selected from GEO data sets (GSE14520,GSE26566, GSE102079, GSE56140, GSE98617, GSE76427, GSE84005).Meta-analysis using RankProd method described in the publicly avail-able tool OMiCC (Shah et al,2016 ) was carried out for these 7 sets of data with 32 healthy, 260 non-tumor samples and 544 tumor samples(Appendix Fig S3A).
At first sample sets of both tumor types were compared against their respective paired non-tumor or healthy sam-ples. Additionally, a standard (Fisher) approach of meta-analysis wasalso carried out and an overlapping set of genes were selected.Then a signature set of genes were identified by matching (among orthologous) genes between mouse and human usingBiomart (Cunningham et al ,2022 ) for the concordant fold change direction as WD +O/RD in the NASH network model and genes that are significant with FDR <15% and Fisher Pvalue<5%.The human liver cancer meta-analysis signature genes overlapped withthe NASH mouse model network genes with treatment effects toidentify subset of genes.Gene ontology analyses The gene ontology and functional enrichment were carried out usingMetascape and innateDB (Breuer et al,2013 ; Zhou et al,2019 ) with mouse or human reference databases.The reference database isdetermined depending on the species of the specific data inquestion.
Pathway summary metric Using published approach (Levine et al,2006 ) with minor adaptions described in our previous papers (Shulzhenko et al ,2011 ; Koscso et al,2020 ), each top gene ontology pathway enriched in the THP-1 experiment (with BTC and TLR ligands and significantly revered byDHA in NASH preventive model) was recognized and the genesbelonging to the pathways were identified. Using median normaliza-tion, a value for each gene in each treatment replicates and thenadditionally using their median, summary metric was calculated forthe individual pathway.A paired t-test between normal and treat- ment condition was performed to evaluate significance.Upstream regulation and transcription factor analysis of BTC The overall analysis strategy consisted of: (i) establishing functionaleffects of BTC represented by BTC-dependent gene expression pro-file.
(ii) Using network analysis among genes regulated by omega-3we infer candidate regulators of BTC-dependent profile expressed incholangiocytes. (iii) searching for transcription factors among groupof genes found is step 2; (iv) identifying which TF has a bindingmotif in BTC gene.Specifically, identification of top BiBC involved in the regulation of Betacellulin in the cholangiocytes were carried out by interrogat-ing the network nodes with the Omega 3 reversal effect in NASHnetwork derived from in vivo data and assigned to cholangiocytes while opposite in BTC treatment in vitro in both LX2 and THP1 experiments to the lipids with EPA/DHA acyl chain in them(Appendix Fig S6A and B).Then from this list of BiBC nodes, the genes with higher than 50 edges/degrees and top 1% <BiBC were further analyzed for transcription factor (TF) activity.
Using the TFbinding prediction analysis tools (SCENIC, TFBSPred ; Aibar et al , 2017 ; Zogopoulos et al,2021 ), the TF motif and binding site in the promoter of Btc were predicted and verified. Statistical analysis In mouse studies, data are expressed as geometric means of repli- cates.Data are shown as the mean /C6standard deviation in animal studies and in vitro experiments.Group comparisons were performed using an unpaired ttest and ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests, where P<0.05 indicates statistical sig- nificance.In cell line and RNA sequence analysis, comparisonsThe paper explained Problem Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD, also known as non- alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH) are major risks factor for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma,and liver failure.
Lack of specific FDA-approved treatments makes thisa prominent health issue affecting roughly one third of the popula-tion, particularly in the Americas and South-East Asia. Althoughomega- 3fatty acids are known for their positive effects on the liver in NASH, a comprehensive analysis to identify the key molecular factorsinvolved is still necessary.Results In this work, we used top-down system biology approach with causalinference analysis to reconstruct a multi-omic network (transcriptome,metabolome, lipidome, single cell RNA sequencing) and to reveal mainmolecular players responsible for beneficial effects of ω3fatty acids on NASH and potentially on liver cancer.In agreement with our previ-ous findings, out of two omega- 3fatty acids tested, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was more potent than eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in itseffects on multi-omic readouts.
In our search for NASH mechanismsthat also play a role in liver cancer, we found that a key aspect ofomega- 3fatty acid action involves inhibiting the expression and func- tion of betacellulin (BTC), a less studied member of the epidermalgrowth factor family. We verified our network predictions in vitro and found that BTC stimulates TGF β-2-driven collagen production in hepatic stellate cells and enhances microbial signals in the inductionof integrins by macrophages.These processes work together to pro-mote liver fibrosis and inflammation.Conversely, omega- 3fatty acids, especially DHA, can interrupt and even reverse these processes.Addi- tionally, we identified the transcription factor FOXO 3as the most likely upstream regulator of the effects of omega- 3fatty acids on BTC.Impact Our research has revealed a novel mechanism through which omega- 3fatty acids regulate liver health, mitigating harmful processes during NASH.
These newfound mechanistic insights have the potential tofacilitate the development of innovative therapies that target the BTCpathway for NASH treatment and liver cancer prevention. Additionally,the gene expression signature triggered by BTC holds promise as apotential biomarker for guiding clinical trials involving ω3PUFA, potentially advancing personalized medicine for liver diseasemanagement./C2112023 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 15:e18367 |2023 17of21Jyothi Padiadpu et al EMBO Molecular Medicine between groups were performed using Student’s ttest or the Mann – Whitney Utest and Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate.Categori- cal variables are shown as counts and percentages.Differencesbetween categorical variables were assessed with the chi-squaredtest or Fisher’s exact test.Spearman’s rank correlation rho coeffi-cients were calculated for network edges between all parametersusing R statistical packages.
