Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera ) contains flavonoids and active ingredients like alkaloids and steroidal lactones which are called ‘Withanolides’. We hypothesize that the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of Ashwagandha might contribute to its overall effectiveness as an anti-carcinogenic agent.The goal of our studywas gain insight into the general biological and molecular functions and immunomodulatoryprocesses that are altered as a result of Ashwagandha treatment in prostate cancer cells, and toidentify the key signaling mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of these physiologicaleffects using genomic microarray analysis in conjunction with quantitative real-time PCR andwestern blot analysis.
Ashwagandha treatment significantly downregulated the gene and proteinexpression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 b, chemokine IL-8, Hsp70 and STAT-2, while a reciprocal upregulation was observed in gene and protein expression of p38 MAPK, PI3K, caspase 6, Cyclin D and c-myc. Furthermore, Ashwagandha treatment significantlymodulated the JAK-STAT pathway which regulates both the apoptosis process as well as theMAP kinase signaling.These studies outline several functionally important classes of genes,which are associated with immune response, signal transduction, cell signaling, transcriptionalregulation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation and provide insight into the molecular signalingmechanisms that are modulated by Ashwagandha, thereby highlighting the use of thisbioflavanoid as effective chemopreventive agent relevant to prostate cancer progression.

African-American men as it is among white American men and exhibits tremendous differences in incidenceamong populations worldwide (1–3).This profoundgeographic and racial variation in prostate cancer riskhas stimulated investigations into how diet affects thedevelopment and progression of prostate cancer (4,5).Phytochemicals are dietary phytoestrogens that may play a role in prostate cancer prevention (6–10).Plant compounds inhibit carcinogenesis via several mechanismsincluding antioxidant activity, changes in carcinogenmetabolism, modulation of the cell cycle, alterationsin intracellular signaling, and inhibition of angiogenesis(10–15).
Approximately 40% of Americans use comple-mentary and alternative medicines (CAM) for diseaseprevention and therapy. Over 5000 flavonoids, the largest class of phenolics, have been described (16–19).Polyphenols that are effective when given during thepost-initiation period, inhibiting tumor promotion andprogression, appear to be more useful in preventingcancer in humans than polyphenols that are effective onlywhen given before and during carcinogen exposure (20).Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera )—known as Indian ginseng is cultivated in India and North America, and whose roots have been used for thousands of years by Ayurvedic practitioners (21,22).Ashwagandha’s root con-tains flavonoids and many active ingredients like alkaloidsand steroidal lactones which are commonly calledWithanolides (16).The chemicals constituents of Ashwa-gandha include three natural powerful antioxidants-superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase(17–19).
Ashwagandha may have chemopreventive proper- ties that make it a potentially useful adjunct for patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy (15, 20). Our previous studies have evaluated the antiprolifera- tive properties of various flavonoids (23,24), and haveindicated that flavonoids can modulate cell cycle regula-tion making them potential anti-cancer agents.To obtain a comprehensive view of the possible molecular and biological processes that are modulated by Ashwagandha treatment to prostate cells, we per- formed genomic analysis using a cDNA microarray.Theuse of the microarray technology allowed us to rapidlyscreen large numbers of potentially relevant genes thatare involved in the controlling of certain key biologicalprocesses, this gives us an insight into the generalphysiological and immunomodulatory processes that arealtered as a result of Ashwagandha treatment of prostate cancer cells.
In the present study, we have attempted to outline specific groups of genes whose expression issignificantly regulated by Ashwagandha in a highlyinvasive prostate cancer cell line PC-3. These studiesshow that several functionally important classes of genes,which are associated with immune response, signaltransduction, cell signaling and transcriptional regulation,apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, can be important targets in bioflavonoid therapy.Material and Methods Cell Culture The human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3 is obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).Approximately 3 /C2106cells per 60 mm dish are cultured at 37/C14C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 95% air for 48 h.Only cell suspensions >90% viableare used for experiments.Dietary Bioflavonoid The alcoholic extract of Ashwagandha was a gift from Sami Labs Limited (Bangalore, India).
In brief, dried rootpowder was extracted with ethyl alcohol at 60–70 /C14C three times and all the three extracts combined. The combined extract was concentrated by distillation of the solvent in Rota vapor under reduced pressure.This extract was storedat –20 /C14C and was stable for several months.For each assay, the extract was freshly solubilized in DMSO and utilized at a 0.5–1 mg/ml concentration.RNA Extraction Cytoplasmic RNA is extracted by an acid guanidinium- thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method as described (25) using Trizol reagent and stored at –80/C14C until used.cDNA Microarrays The gene microarrays (Roswell Park Cancer Institute; Microarray and Genomics Core Facility) consisted of/C245043 cDNA clones (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) which were selected based on their association with cancer progression.A total of six RNA samples that includedthe three sets of Ashwagandha-treated (1 mg/ml) PC-3 cells and three sets of untreated controls.
cDNA was synthesized from each of those RNA samples and the Ashwagandha-treated samples were labeled with Cy5,while the corresponding untreated controls were labeledwith the Cy3 dye. To minimize intra-array variations, two hybridizations for each sample were performed, and additionally the labeling with the Cy dyes was inter-changed, so as to have technical replicates of the matched pairs of Ashwagandha-treated and untreated samples.Microarray Data Processing and Analysis Expression data extracted from image files were first checked by an M (log 2(Cy3/Cy5)) versus A((log 2(Cy3) + log2(Cy5))/2) plot to see whether intensity-dependent expression bias existed between spots (genes) labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 on each individual slide.Data normal-ization was done to correct the intensity-dependentexpression bias.
After data normalization, the average178 Anti-proliferative effects of Ashwagandha intensity of individual gene from multiple spots on each slide was computed using an in-house developed PERL script. A total of 5043 average expression values were obtained.Paired t-test on normalized intensity with low P-values was used to generate a list of genes with significant change in expression between normal and Ashwagandha-treated samples.The false positive rate(FDR) of the significant genes was estimated by using the SAM algorithm.Detailed normalization approaches have been described in our previous publication (26–28).Real-time, Quantitative RT-PCR Gene expression was quantitated using real-time PCR.Relative expression of mRNA species was calculated using the comparative C Tmethod (29).All data were controlled for quantity of RNA input by performing measurements on an endogenous reference gene, b-actin.
Western Blot Analysis PC-3 cells were cultured with Ashwagandha (1 mg/ml) for 48 h, cells lysed and 30 mg of total extracted protein was separated on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (30) and electroblotted to PVDF membranes which were further probed with specific primary antibodies against the proteins of interest. Cell Proliferation Assays PC-3 cells are plated at a density of /C241000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated with varying concentrations of Ashwagandha (0.5–1 mg/ml) in complete medium for 24 h.Cell viability is quantified using the MTS assay [Promega CellTiter 96/C213AQ ueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Cat.# G5421); Promega, Madison, WI] as described previously (31,32).Results Ashwagandha Inhibits Cell Proliferation PC3 cells (1000 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well plate and treated with Ashwagandha extract at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/ml for 24 h.
The results of our cell proliferation assay show that Ashwagandha treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-depen- dent manner (Fig. 1).The percentage inhibition at 0.5 and 1mg/ml Ashwagandha concentrations was 39% and 68%, respectively.Supplementation of medium with 0.2%DMSO, which was used as the solvent had no detectable effect on cell proliferation or on the cell morphology.Modulation of Gene Expression in PC-3 Cells Treated with Ashwagandha To compare gene expression levels between Ashwagandha- treated PC-3 cells and their respective untreated controls.Treatment of PC-3 cells with 0.2% DMSO had no detectable effect on PC-3 cells and consequently this group was not used in subsequent studies.We used theregularized paired t-test (28) to detect differentially expressed genes, which resulted in 266 significant genes with low P-values.
For multiple test correction to control the FDR, these genes were further subjected to SAM analysis, which resulted in a shorter list of 249 genes with an estimated <1% FDR. Out of these 249 differentiallyexpressed genes, 137 (55.02%) were up-regulated and 112(44.57%) were down-regulated with Ashwagandha treat- ment, as shown in Fig.2 in black and gray color, respectively.These results indicate that based on statisticalanalysis a large number of genes were differentially exp- ressed between Ashwagandha-treated and untreated cells.The differentially expressed genes have been subdividedinto various functional categories.Table 1 outlines the fold change in the gene expression of significantly modulated genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation, regulation ofapoptosis, modulation of stress proteins, cytokine andchemokine regulation, regulation of signal transduction, regulation of structural proteins, and oncogene regulation.
Categorization of Differentially Expressed Genes Based on the Biological and Molecular Function To enhance biological interpretation of the differentially expressed genes from our cDNA microsarray studies, wesought to see if any of the biological processes ormolecular function were over-represented by the Figure 1. Ashwagandha treatment inhibits cell proliferation in PC-3 cells.Results show that treatment with Ashwagandha significantlydecreased cell proliferation.Data are the mean /C6SD of three separate experiments done in triplicate.Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA.eCAM 2010;7(2) 179 differentially expressed genes.We therefore performed a function enrichment analyses for these genes usinga functional classification tool.DAVID 2.0 (33).Our results indicated that, although there were many over-represented biological function categories as canbeen seen from Table 2, majority of them are related toa few major function categories.
The most relevantfunction categories include immune response, proteinkinase cascade, regulation of apoptosis, and regulation ofcell cycle. Analysis of Microarray Data Using Functional Annotational Clustering We further analyzed our microarray data using func- tional annotation clustering for our differentiallyexpressed genes to see if any of these genes could beclustered together, thus establishing biological linksbetween genes.The resulting gene clusters are shown inTable 3, in which the group enrichment scores whichrank the genes based on their biological significance arealso listed.The results of this analysis outline, two groupsof genes that are tightly coupled.
The first group of genes included caspase recruitment domain family, member 4; receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2; casp8 andfadd-like apoptosis regulator; mitogen-activated proteinkinase kinase 5; cell division cycle 2-like 5, while thesecond group of genes displaying tight coupling includedsignal transducer and activator of transcription 2 andc-myc binding protein. Mapping Signaling Pathways Using Functional Genomics Data Biological implications can also be deduced from biochemical pathways triggered by the list of genesmodulated by Ashwagandha treatment.By looking at the over-representation of genes in pathways, we couldobtain direct or indirect insight into the physiologicalfunctions of these significantly modulated genes.
Usingyet another feature of the DAVID functional annotationtool called DAVID Pathway Viewer, a short list ofsignificant pathways (Table 4) was obtained which displays key functional genes from the entire list of significantly modulated genes (249 in this case) onpathway maps thus facilitating biological interpretationin a network context. Our results show that our geneswere significantly enriched along three distinct pathways.They are JAK-STAT pathway, the apoptosis pathwayand the MAPK signaling pathway.Among these theJAK-STAT pathway appears to be the key because it not only modulates both the apoptosis process and the MAPK signaling but also is the signaling pathway thatis most significantly modulated as indicated by theP-value <0.0037 (Table 4 and Fig.3).
Ashwagandha Modulates Gene and Protein Expression of a Group of Cytokines, Chemokines, Apoptotic Markers,Cell Cycle Proteins and Signal Transduction Molecules Based on the functional annotation analysis using DAVID as described above, a group of genes thatmodulate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and regulatekey biological and molecular functions were selected.They included IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 b, STAT 2, p38 MAPK, PI3K, Caspase 6, Hsp70, Cyclin D, and c-myc. Thesegenes are significantly modulated by Ashwagandha treatment as shown by gene array analysis.To further validate our findings, we performed quantitative real-timePCR using specific PCR primers and western blotanalysis for protein expression for these key regulatorygenes.Our results presented in Fig.
4 show that PC-3cells treated with 1 mg/ml Ashwagandha displayed down- regulation of gene expression of the proinflammatorycytokines IL-6 (55% down-regulation, P< 0.002), IL-1 b (41% down-regulation, P< 0.05), chemokine IL-8 (32% down-regulation, P< 0.04) and stress heat shock protein Hsp70 (23% down-regulation, P< 0.02). Ashwagandha treatment also down-regulated SignalTransducer and Activator of Transcription 2 (STAT-2)(34% down-regulation, P< 0.01), a dual function protein that regulates signal transduction and activates transcrip-tion as part of a phosphorylation cascade.The genes that were significantly upregulated with Ashwagandha treatment were p38 MAPK (69% upregulation,P< 0.013); PI3K (51% upregulation, P< 0.04) caspase 6 (44% upregulation, P< 0.03); Cyclin D (71% upregu- lation, P< 0.006) and c-myc (29% upregulation, P< 0.043).The respective percent increases in protein expression for each these genes are shown in Fig.5.
Ourresults show that PC-3 cells treated with 1 mg/ml Ashwagandha downregulated the protein expression of Figure 2. Distribution of differentially expressed genes shown as a scatter plot representation of the average log 2ratio between normal and Ashwagandha-treated PC-3 cells for the 249 genes.Statisticallysignificant genes ( P-value < 0.01) identified by two-step analyses of t-test and SAM are shown in color, including down-regulated genes (in grey) and up-regulated genes (in black).Dashed lines indicatetwo-fold changes.180 Anti-proliferative effects of Ashwagandha Table 1.Functional classification of significantly modulated genes Gene Acession no Gene nomenclature Physiological function Fold change in gene expression Cell cycle regulation AI340905 Cyclin D3 D-type cyclins are essential for progression from G1 to S-phase.

We observed concordance between gene expression andprotein expression levels in the Ashwagandha-treated PC-3cells. Furthermore, these results showed similar trends ingene expression as those obtained by our microarray analysis thus validating our gene microarray results presented in Table 1.Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis for the above data was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), following theMann–Whitney U-test to determine the statistical differ-ence between control and treated groups.P< 0.05 was considered significant.Discussion Withania somnifera Dunal , which is commonly known as Ashwagandha is reported to have antitumor, anti-stress, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antibacterialeffects (11–15).The roots of W.somnifera contain several alkaloids, withanolides, a few flavanoids and reducing sugars (14–19).
Several studies support the role ofashwagandha as an effective cancer chemopreventive agent, however limited information is available regarding the mechanism of regulation of these chemopreventiveeffects (20). The goal of our study was gain insight intothe general biological and molecular functions and immunomodulatory processes that are altered as a result of Ashwagandha treatment in prostate cancercells, and to identify the key signaling mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of these physiologicalTable 4.DAVID Pathway Viewer lists key signaling pathways that are modulated by ashwangandha treatment Signaling pathways Genes (%) P-value JAK-STAT Signaling pathway 11.6 3.7E /C03 Apoptosis 7.2 1.3E /C02 MAPK Signaling pathway 10.1 1.8E /C02Table 2.Functional annotation classification based on physiological function of significantly regulated genes.

The group enrichmentscore represents the geometric mean (in log scale) of member’s P-values in a corresponding annotation cluster.This is used to rank theirbiological significance.
The Functional Annotation Clustering integrates the techniques of Kappa statistics to measure the degree of the common genes between two annotations, and fuzzy heuristic clustering to classifythe groups of similar annotations according to kappa values. Thus, themore common genes annotations share, the higher chance they will begrouped together.The P-values associated with each annotation terms inside each clusters are obtained using the Fisher’s Exact test or/EASE Score.In DAVID annotation system, the Fisher’s Exact test is adopted to measure the gene-enrichment in annotation terms.eCAM 2010;7(2) 183 effects.Since the alcohol extract of Ashwagandha can contain numerous molecules that are antiproliferative the biological effect that we observed could be due to one or many compounds.The effect could also be additive innature.
However, on initial reverse phase HPLC analysis of the alcohol extract we observed that the anti- proliferative effect was confined to a compound thateluted at 10.7 min, giving a peak at m/zof 567 (data not given). Therefore, it is our conviction that the majority ofthe antiproliferative and the effects on gene expression that we observed in this study is due to this particular compound; further characterization of the compound is ongoing in our laboratory.Our results showed that Ashwagandha treatment modulated several functionally important classes ofgenes, which are associated with cell cycle regulation,regulation of apoptosis, modulation of stress proteins,cytokine and chemokine regulation, regulation of signaltransduction, and oncogene regulation in prostate cancer cells (PC-3).
Additionally, a good concordance was observed between our microarray data, and the resultsobtained using both our validation methodologies,namely the real time PCR analysis and the Westernblot analysis, however some of the protein expressionlevels did not show the extent of changes as seen in the gene expression level. This could possibly be due to the post-transcriptional or post-translational modificationassociated with protein expression.Analysis of ourmicroarray data using functional annotation clusteringshowed significantly modulated gene clusters and pro-vides group enrichment scores which rank the genes based on their biological significance.These analyses further confirm the important role played by genes thatregulate apoptosis, cell signaling and signal transductionin the Ashwagandha-mediated immunomodulation.
Using the function annotation tool DAVID Pathway Viewer, we were able to highlight key signaling pathwaysvia which the immunomodulatory effects of Ashwagandha are mediated. Our results show three distinct pathways that are significantly modulated; theyare JAK-STAT pathway, the apoptosis pathway and theMAPK signaling pathway.Among these the JAK-STATpathway appears to be key because it also modulatesboth the apoptosis process and the MAPK signaling.Figure 3.Schematic representation of the genes regulated by Ashwagandha extract in JAK-STAT signaling pathway.The genes highlighted with an asterisk (*) are significantly regulated by Ashwagandha and are important in the regulation of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis andimmunomodulation.Figure 4.Ashwagandha treatment significantly modulates gene expres- sion in PC-3 cells.Graphical representation of quantitative changes ingene expression by real-time PCR.
Relative mRNA species expression was quantitated and expressed as transcript accumulation index (TAI= 2 –/C1/C1CT), calculated using the comparative C Tmethod. All data were controlled for quantity of RNA input by performing measurements onan endogenous reference gene, b-actin.In addition, results on RNA from Ashwagandha-treated samples were normalized to results obtained on RNA from the control, untreated sample.Data are the mean /C6SD of three separate experiments done in triplicate.Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA.184 Anti-proliferative effects of Ashwagandha Ashwagandha treatment significantly downregulated the gene and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 b, chemokine IL-8, Hsp70 and STAT-2, while a reciprocal upregulation was observed in gene and protein expression of p38 MAPK, PI3K, caspase 6, Cyclin D and c-myc.
Several in vitro studies show that polyphenols can modulate oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycling, apoptosis, angiogenesis and associated signal transduction pathways (34,35). Tyagi et al .(36) showed that the anticancer effects of grape seed extract (GSE) on moder-ately aggressive DU-145 prostate cancer cells were due to activation of the JNK pathway, resulting in growth inhibition and apoptosis.Recent studies demonstrated that flavonoids can inhibit proliferation of other cancers by interfering with tubulin binding and subsequent micro- tubule assembly (37), among the 249 genes that were significantly modulated by Ashwagandha, several were structural proteins, like filamin A, laminin and tight junction protein-zona occludens 2.The significant anti- tumor effects of flavonoids are attributed to the modula- tion of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (38).
Suppressionof carcinogenesis by tumor suppressor genes is mediated by constraining tumor cell proliferation and colony forma- tion. The tumor suppressor genes, suppresses tumor growth by modulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and causes G1 cell cycle arrest and cell death (39–41).The cyclin D gene encodes a regulatory subunit ofthe CDK4 and CDK6 holoenzyme complex that phos- phorylates and inactivates the tumor suppressor protein, pRB, thereby modulating cell cycle progression into late G1 and S phases (41–43).Ashwangandha treatment down regulates the expres- sion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1bhereby acting as a immunomodulator, via the dynamic regulation of these cytokines.These cytokines are crucial to innate and adaptive inflammatoryresponses, cell growth and differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis and developmental as well as repair processes.
The janus kinase/signal transducer and acti- vator of transduction (JAK/STAT) pathway is a intra- cellular signal-transducing pathway that is activated by oxygen radicals, various cytokines, and growth factors in various disease states (44,45). Originally described as theregulator for cytokine signaling, JAK/STAT pathway is now recognized as an important membrane-to-nucleus signaling pathway for a variety of stress responses and oxidative stress.STAT proteins have the dual function of signal transduction and activation of transcription as partof a phosphorylation cascade (44).Ashwagandha down- regulates the expression of STAT2 which is a potent transactivator and forms stable homodimers which complex with adaptor protein p48 and bind to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) thereby modulating cell proliferation and immunity.Figure 5.Ashwagandha treatment significantly modulates protein expression in PC-3 cells.

Data are the mean /C6SD of three separate experiments done in triplicate.Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA.eCAM 2010;7(2) 185 Stress-inducible heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has gained plenty of attention as a putative target for tumor therapy since it is an important regulator of cancer cell growth.Expression of Hsp70 in tumor cellshas been proposed to enhance their immunogenicity andprevent tumor cell death (46).Ashwagandha treatmentsignificantly decreases the gene and protein expression of Hsp70, which may result in the generation of a specific immune response by promoting apoptosis.The oncogenec-myc gene participates in most aspects of cellularfunction, including replication, growth, metabolism,differentiation, and apoptosis (34,35).
Our studies high- light that treatment of PC-3 cells with Ashwagandha results in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)signaling, indicating that it may be the key signalingpathway involved in the process leading to activation ofapoptosis in these cancer cells. Thus, plant-derived antioxidants can modulate biochemical and physiological processes that may affect cancer progression.Based on itspro-apoptotic and its immunomodulatory effects,Ashwagandha can be considered to be useful as novelcomplementary therapy for integrative oncology care.Furthermore, based on this preliminary finding we would like to characterize the active ingredient using reversephase HPLC separation.The eluted compound whichshows the presence of active ingredients would be furthercharacterized using the NMR and the mass spectroscopy to elucidate the structure of the molecule.References 1.American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2007 .Atlanta, GA: American Cancer Society, 2007.2.
