Isolated Head Tremor as an Initial Presentation of Ataxia with Vitamin EDeﬁciency: A Case Report Jiaxiang Li, MD, Zhiru Lin, MD, Nan Jin, MD, Xiaosheng Zheng, MD, and Wei Luo, MD, PhD * Isolated head tremor is a frequent clinical presentation with a diverse etiology that can be challenging to establish.The differential diagnosis often inc ludes cervical dystonic tremor, essential tremor, and various cerebellar diseases.We present a case of a male patient presenting with isolated head tremor diagnosed with ataxia with vitamin E de ﬁciency (AVED).Case Report A 42-year-old male of Han Chinese ethnicity presented with involuntary head shaking since his early twenties, which pro- gressively worsened and extended to his upper limbs.Factors such as stress and anxiety appeared to intensify the tremor, which persisted even when he was lying down.Alcohol had no mitigating effect, and a family history of similar symptoms was absent.
He had previously been diagnosed with essential tremor at another medical institution. Various therapeutic interventions, including propranolol (90 mg/day), gabapentin (0.9 g/day), clonazepam (1 mg/day), trihexyphenidyl (6 mg/day), and botuli- num toxin, were administered, but yielded little improvement.Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus resulted in some bene ﬁt, but post-surgery dysarthria led to device removal at the patient ’s behest.Therefore, further programming adjustment was notmade.Consequently, he sought further evaluation at our hospital.Neurological examination (Video 1) demonstrated dystonic head tremor, bilateral postural hand tremor predominantly affecting the right hand, and mild impairment of the tandem gait.Notably, no bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, or Babinski sign was observed.Eye movements, strength, re ﬂexes, proprioception, and other sensory modalities were preserv ed.
Brain magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) did not reveal any structural abnormalities or atrophy (Fig. 1).Nerve conduction study indicated mild neuropathy, particularly a reduced sensory conduction veloc- ity in the left super ﬁcial peroneal nerve.Video 1.The video shows a 42-year-old male exhibiting dystonic head tremor and bilateral postural hand tremor,predominantly affecting the right hand.The head tremor wascharacterized by an irregular, jerky pattern with variableamplitude.Partial suppression was possible by turning the head toward one side and touching the lower face, whereas voluntary movements exacerbated the tremor, which isconsistent with the features of a dystonic tremor.
Neurologicalexamination also revealed mild impairment in the tandem gait.Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/ doi/10.1002/mdc3.13886 Department of Neurology, The Second Af ﬁliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China *Correspondence to: Luo Wei, Department of Neurology, Second Af ﬁliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China; E-mail: luoweirock@zju.edu.cn .

CASE REPORT CLINICAL PRACTICE Laboratory tests revealed a low serum vitamin E ( α-tocopherol) level (1.61 mg/L; normal range =5.5–17.0 mg/L). The results of additional assessments, including thyroid function, serum ceruloplasmin, ferritin, and vitamin B12 level, were within normal ranges.Whole genome sequencing identi ﬁed biallelic mutations in the TTPA gene [c.575G>A (p.R192H), c.358G>A (p.A120T)], both classi ﬁed as likely pathological in accordance with The American College of Medical Geneticsand Genomics criteria.1These mutations segregated in the patient ’sf a m i l y( F i g .2).Considering the symptoms and genetic ﬁndings, a diagnosis of AVED was established.Subsequently, we initiated vitamin E supplementation at a dosage of 1200 mg/day.Following this intervention, serum vitamin E levels were restored to normal(last recorded level: 9.0 mg/L).
After 1 year of consistent vitamin E supplementation, the patient ’s condition remained stable.Discussion AVED is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in the TTPA gene, resulting in reduced serum vitamin E levels and varying in presentation and severity.1-3 Whereas the majority of AVED patients present with cerebellarataxia, 4our patient showed only mild impairment of the tandem gait and no signs of cerebellar atrophy in brain MRI scan. His mild phenotype may be explained by the identi ﬁed missense mutations, which differ from th ose causing severe childhood- onset AVED.4 Head tremor is present in /C2440% of AVED patients.5Dystonic tremor may occur in AVED, but is seldom reported to be a pre-dominant presenting feature.Previous case reports have described AVED patients presenting with isolated dystonia or dystonic tremor before developing ataxia.Becker et al 6reported two FIG.2.Genetic analysis of the patient ’s family.

AVED is a treatable condition that is often under-recognized, particularly in regions such as Asia, where it is rare. Early intervention with high-dose vitamin E supplementationmay prevent disease progression and improve symptoms.To our knowledge, no studies have reported the use of DBS speciﬁcally for AVED, although two cases of DBS for abet- alipoproteinemia has been documented.Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that also results in vitamin E de ﬁ- ciency and presents with neurological de ﬁcits, including tremors and ataxia.Mammis et al 8described a 41-year-old male with abetalipoproteinemia treated with bilateral VIM DBS for dis- abling tremors.Signi ﬁcant improvements in tremor of extremi- ties and slight improvements in head tremor were noted after 8 months.More recently, Cortier et al9reported a 53-year-old male with abetalipoproteinemia and refractory intentional tremortreated by VIM DBS.
The excellent response to VIM DBS supports DBS as a potential therapy for medically refractory tremors in vitamin E-de ﬁcient diseases. Conversely, our patient did not respond well to DBS.A potential reason for our patient ’s poor outcome was the lack of DBS programming adjustments after implantation.Further research is warranted to determineoptimal targeting and long-term outcomes.Author Roles (1) Research project: A.Conception, B.Organization,C.Execution: (2) Statistical Analysis: A.Design, B.Execution,C.Review and Critique; (3) Manuscript Preparation: A.Writing of the First Draft, B.Review and Critique.J.L.: 1A, 1B, 1C, 3A.Z.L.: 1C, 3A.N.J.: 1B, 1C, 3B.X.Z.: 1C, 3B.W.L.: 1C, 3B.Acknowledgments We express our gratitude to the patient for granting permissionto publish this information and to Dr.Piu Chan, MD, PhD, andDr.J.K.
