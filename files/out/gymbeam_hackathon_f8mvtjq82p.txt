Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID -19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID - 19.The COVID -19 resource centre is hosted on Elsevier Connect, the company's public news and information website.Elsevier hereby grants permission to make all its COVID -19-related research that is available on the COVID -19 resource centre - including th is research content - immediately available in PubMed Central and other publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re -use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the o riginal source.These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID -19 resource centre remains active.

With large population sections in these countries likely to be infected with COVID-19 in the coming months, weighing the potential benefits vs risks of iron supplementation during the pandemic is im- portant to ensure that the program causes no unintended harm.Although iron supplementation in iron deficient individuals offers immune enhancing benefits, it can also exacerbate infections and in-flammation [1].Evidence in the context of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV suggests that iron is important for viral replication [2].
In addition, inflammation during SARS-CoV2 infection (Appendix 1) could promote hepcidin production which inhibits iron uptake in the gut (limiting the impact of supplemental iron) and can lead to iron sequestration in macrophages, enterocytes and hepatocytes. Due to presence of Angio- tensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors, SARS-CoV2 may colonize these cells, and the sequestered iron could be utilized for viral replication.Enhanced hepcidin production favouring viral persistence has been demonstrated in Hepatitis C [3].In SARS-COV-2, a hepcidin mimetic action of viral spike protein has also been reported [4].Moreover, iron chelators are considered to be promising adjuvants to treat the disease [2].Furthermore, oral iron supplementation in the presence of in- flammation may lead to enhanced oxidative stress and adverse gut microbiome [1].We are, therefore, concerned about the safety and effectiveness of iron supplementation programs during COVID-19 pandemic.
Temporary cessation of the program would deprive millions of bene- ficiaries from the immune enhancing benefit of iron. Screening for iron deficiency before iron supplementation may not work because markers such as ferritin may be elevated during viral infection despite low body iron stores.Strategies like screening for hepcidin (to predict iron ab- sorption) and / or C-reactive protein (to identify inflammation) using point-of-care tests followed by supplementation, therefore, merit eva- luation.Funding sources This article received no specific funding Prior presentation No data from this manuscript were presented in a scientific meeting before.Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influ- ence the work reported in this paper.Appendix A.Supplementary data Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110173.
