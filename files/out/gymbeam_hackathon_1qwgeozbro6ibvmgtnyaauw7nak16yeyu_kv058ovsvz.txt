However, research suggests that CrM supplementation may also serve as a therapeutic tool in the management of some chronic and traumatic diseases. Creatine supplementation has been reported to improve high-energy phosphate availability as well as have antioxidative, neuroprotective, anti-lactatic, and calcium-homoeostatic effects.These characteristics may have a direct impact on mitochondrion’s survival and health particularly during stressful conditions such as ischemia and injury.This narrative review discusses current scientiﬁc evidence for use or supplemental CrM as a therapeutic agent during conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.Based on this analysis, it appears that CrM supplementation may have a role in improving cellular bioenergetics in several mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases, ischemic conditions, and injury pathology and thereby could provide therapeutic beneﬁt in the management of these conditions.
However, larger clinical trials are needed to explore these potential therapeutic applications before deﬁnitive conclusions can be drawn.

The metabolic basis of creatine in health and disease has been recently reviewed in detail by Bonilla and colleagues [ 1] (see Figure 1). Brieﬂy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) serves as the primary source of energy in most living cells.Enzymatic degradation of ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) liberates free energy to fuel metabolic activity.However, only a small amount of ATP is stored in the cell.Energy derived from the degradation of phosphocreatine (PCr) serves to resynthesize ADP and Pi back to ATP to maintain cellular function until glycolysis in the cytosol and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria can produce enough ATP to meet metabolic demands.Creatine also plays an important role in shuttling Pi from the mitochondria into the cytosol to form PCr to help maintain cellular bioenergetics (i.e., Creatine Phosphate Shuttle) [8].
In this way, PCr can donate its phosphate to ADP , thereby restoring ATP for cellular needs leaving creatine in the cytosol Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14030529 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 2 of 24 to diffuse back into the mitochondria to shuttle the next phosphate to locations far from its production site [ 8].The ATP stored in the cells is usually sufﬁcient for energy depletion that lasts less than two seconds.However, another two to seven seconds of muscle contractions are fueled by depleting available PCr stores [ 9].Together, the ATP–PCr energy system provides energy to fuel short-term explosive exercise.Increasing PCr and creatine in muscle provides an energy reserve to meet anaerobic energy needs, thereby providing a critical source of energy particularly during ischemia, injury, and/or in response to impaired mitochondrial function [8,10].

Numerous studies over the last three decades have shown that creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation (e.g., 4 ×5 g/day for 5–7 days or 3–6 g/day for 4–12 weeks) increases muscle creatine and PCr content by 20–40% [5,11–15] and brain creatine content by 5–15% [ 16–21]. Creatine monohydrate supplementation has been reported to safely improve high-intensity exercise performance by 10–20% leading to greater training adap- tations in adolescents [ 22–26], young adults [ 27–38], and older individuals [ 21,39–48].No clinically signiﬁcant side effects have been reported other than a desired weight gain [ 49].Additionally, there is little to no evidence that CrM causes anecdotal reports of bloating, gastrointestinal distress, disproportionate increase in water retention, increased stress on the kidneys, increased susceptibility to injury, etc.[ 49,50].In fact, studies directly assessing whether creatine causes some of those issues found no or opposite effects.
As a result, there has been interest in assessing whether CrM supplementation may beneﬁt a number of clinical populations including conditions that impair mitochondrial function [ 6]. The rationale is that since CrM supplementation can increase high-energy phosphate avail- ability and also has antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-lactatic, and calcium-homoeostatic effects, increasing phosphagen availability may help improve cell survival and/or health outcomes in conditions in which mitochondrial function is compromised (e.g., ischemia, injury, and/or non-communicable chronic diseases).The purpose of this review is to exam- ine the literature related to the role of CrM supplementation in the management of various conditions characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and make recommendations about further work needed in this area.2.
Methods The methodological basis of this narrative review is a selective literature search in the PubMed database, supplemented by a free Internet search (German and English). In a ﬁrst explorative step, the search terms “creatine supplementation” and/or “mitochondrial dysfunction” and “creatine” and/or “mitochondrial disease” were used.After a ﬁrst analysis of the searched literature identifying 68 articles, a new selective literature search was performed in the sources described above using the terms mentioned above, adding relevant cited sources and cross-references.Subsequently, titles, abstracts and ﬁnally full- text articles were examined by the scientiﬁc team with regard to the suitability of the articles in terms of content and, in a subsequent step, in terms of quality.
After the qualitative criteria had been veriﬁed, the content exploration was carried out following thematic questions related to the role of creatine in context: (1) Ergogenic role in mitochondrial dysfunction; (2) Noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCD); (3) Cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart failure; (4) Traumatic and ischemic CNS injuries; (5) Neurodegenerative disorders; (6) Psychological disorders; and (7) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome and Long COVID. 3.Creatine’s Ergogenic Role in Mitochondrial Dysfunction Although there is not clear deﬁnition of mitochondrial dysfunction, it generally refers to conditions that reduce the ability of the mitochondria to contribute to production of energy in the form of ATP .However, any alteration of normal mitochondrial function could be called “mitochondrial dysfunction” as well [ 51].
Mitochondrial dysfunction can be of primary origin through inheriting pathological altered mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or acquiring secondary dysfunction through aging and exposure to mtDNA damaging Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 4 of 24 processes [ 52,53]. This can be due to traumatic ischemic (blood deﬁcient) or anoxic (oxygen deﬁcient) as well as chronic conditions.Most common reasons for mitochondrial dys- function are hypoxia, overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and an alteration of the intracellular calcium homoeostasis.Since creatine supplementation increases the availability of PCr, it may help cells withstand ischemic challenges and/or offset energy deﬁcits associated with mitochondrial dysfunction 3.1.Acute, Traumatic Mitochondrial Dysfunction Figure 2 shows the schematic sequence of an acute traumatic mitochondrial dysfunc- tion with possible subsequent ischemia.The mechanical forces of injury result in an inﬂux of calcium, potassium, and sodium.
A calcium gradient is created, which reduces mitochon- drial function [ 54,55]. In addition, an injury can lead to short-term ischemia (hypoxia) due to swelling, edema formation, development of neuroinﬂammation, obstruction of vessels, or hemorrhage [ 56].The resulting oxygen deﬁciency interrupts the respiratory chain in the mitochondria.In both cases, the cell must switch to the energetic emergency plan and produce energy glycolytically, thereby increasing lactate production [ 57–61].Oxygen radicals are generated, causing oxidative stress.This leads to cell damage and ultimately to cell death (apoptosis) [ 62–64].If sufﬁcient creatine phosphate reserves are present, the cell can compensate short-term energy deﬁcits.ATP-dependent calcium transporters can coun- teract the calcium gradient under consumption of ATP and PCr, maintain the cell milieu, and thus normalize mitochondrial function [ 65,66].Oxygen radicals can be intercepted [ 67].
Even transient hypoxia of a few seconds can be counteracted by the body in this way [68]. There is evidence that creatine and cyclocreatine inhibit the mitochondrial–creatine kinase– adenine nucleotide translocator (Mi-Cr-ANT) complex and the mitochondrial permeability transition that is associated with ischemic injury and apoptosis [ 69].Additionally, cre- atine enhances the ability of Mi-CK to shuttle ADP for oxidative phosphorylation and PCr formation, thereby decreasing mitochondrial membrane and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 70].Since impairment in cellular energy production and increased oxidative stress are common features in several neuromuscular degenerative diseases, creatine supplementation may provide some therapeutic beneﬁt [ 69,70].In support of this premise, Sakellaris et al.[ 71,72] reported that oral administered creatine can be used as an additional supplement in treatment of acute mitochondrial dysfunction after brain injury.
These studies showed clear improvement in clinical outcomes of patients with additional creatine-supplementation in comparison to no creatine-intake. Table 1 shows the level of evidence in humans that creatine supplementation may have a positive effect on treatment outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury.Nutrients 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 25 Figure 2.Panel A: Intracellular cascade after injury, infarction or contusion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.Panel B: Impact of creatine on mitochondrial dysfunction.Green shows direct in- crease/stimulation of Cr/PCr, red shows direct decrease/inhibition of Cr/PCr, d otted line represents indirect impact of Cr/PCr on cellular pathways.ATP is adenosine triphosphate; Cr is creatine; PCr is phosphocreatine; ROS is reactive oxygen species; mPTP is mitochondrial permeability transition pore.Adapted from Dean et al.[55].3.2.
Chronic, Atraumatic Mitochondrial Dysfunction Many chronic diseases such as cancer and age -related pathological conditions have been related to an altered mitochondrial function [73–101]. Chronic mitochondrial dys- function is usually caused by slow cha nges in mitochondrial homeostasis eventually lead- ing to an increase in ROS/NOS, glycolysis , and hyper -acidosis.There are multiple factors that directly damage mitochondrial function ( Figure 3 ).Hypoxia is a common factor in conditions such as solid tumor, ischemia , or inflammation that leads to a depletion of ox- ygen and eventually through production of ROS to an alteration of intracellular proteins, lipids and DNA [89].On the other hand, research was able to prove that malignant cells tend to create energ y under glycolytic conditions although sufficient oxygen is provided.This pathological mechanism is called “Warburg Effect” [102,103] .This leads to an in- crease in cell acidity and an increase in ROS with damaging of DNA.
Other factors leading to chronic mitochondrial dysfunction are toxic metals or reactive nitrogen species (NOS) [104] . An increase in ingested carbohydrates bigger than the individual needs leads to hyperinsulinemia.As a chronic condition , this will lead to an increase in receptor for ad- vanced glycation end products (RAGE).Thus, nitrosative stress increases, manipulating Figure 2.Cont .Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 5 of 24 Nutrients 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 25 Figure 2.Panel A: Intracellular cascade after injury, infarction or contusion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.Panel B: Impact of creatine on mitochondrial dysfunction.Green shows direct in- crease/stimulation of Cr/PCr, red shows direct decrease/inhibition of Cr/PCr, d otted line represents indirect impact of Cr/PCr on cellular pathways.ATP is adenosine triphosphate; Cr is creatine; PCr is phosphocreatine; ROS is reactive oxygen species; mPTP is mitochondrial permeability transition pore.Adapted from Dean et al.[55].

Hypoxia is a common factor in conditions such as solid tumor, ischemia, or inﬂammation that leads to a depletion of oxygen and eventually through production of ROS to an alteration of intracellular proteins, lipids and DNA [ 89]. On the other hand, research was able to prove that malignant cells tend to create energy under glycolytic conditions although sufﬁcient oxygen is provided.This pathological mechanism is called “Warburg Effect” [ 102,103].This leads to an increase in cell acidity and an increase in ROS with damaging of DNA.Other factors leading to chronic mitochondrial dysfunction are toxic metals or reactive nitrogen species (NOS) [ 104].An increase in ingested carbohydrates bigger than the individual needs leads to hyperin- sulinemia.As a chronic condition, this will lead to an increase in receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).Thus, nitrosative stress increases, manipulating mitochon- drial function [ 105–109].
Increasing stress will lead to an intracellular accumulation of ammonium [ 110–112], ROS [ 113], lactate [ 114], ultimately inhibiting the Krebs cycle and oxidative metabolism. Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 6 of 24 Nutrients 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 25 mitochondrial function [105–109].Increasing stress will lead to an intracellular accumula- tion of ammonium [110–112], ROS [113] , lactate [114] , ultimately inhibiting the Krebs cycle and oxidative metabolism.Figure 3.Warburg Effect: glycolysis produces 2 ATP instead of 36 ATP, in pathological tissues even despite aerobic conditions.Glc is glucose, Oxy is oxygen, ATP is adenosine triphosphate.Adapted from Vander Heiden et al.[91].Typical factors that lead to a disturbance in the cellular respiration are hypoxia, in- flammation, viruses, mutations, oncogenes, age, radiation , and carcinogens [115] .The ul- timate, most common denominators are reactive species which damage m tDNA.
As soon as cellular defense system s such as antioxidants, intracellular energetic buffer, and enzy- matic reactions are worn down, chronic alteration of cellular organelles begins [116] . As mentioned above, it is hard to differentiate in chronic mitoch ondrial dysfunction whether pathological conditions lead to hypoxia that produces ROS/NOS which eventually harms mtDNA or whether an altered mtDNA leads to an overexpression of ROS/NOS damaging itself [117] .It is widely accepted, however, that this chroni c status is a vicious circle lead- ing to a lethal cellular condition harming the host.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an analytical tool that detects electromag- netical signals that are produced by the atomic nuclei within the molecules.Thus, it c an be used to (non -invasively) measure concentrations for specific molecules in tissue.
This technique has extensively been used in neurological research to identify phosphorus and proton metabolites in tissue in vivo [118–121]. Using this, research was ab le to prove mi- tochondrial dysfunction in patients with bipolar disorders.These patients also suffered from an impaired energy production [122] , increased levels of lactate (hyperacidotic state) [123] and PCr concentration [114,124,125] .Therefore, it was assumed that creatine supple- mentation could improve clinical outcome in cases of mitochondrial dysfunction.Creatine is able to buffer lactate accumulation by reducing the need for glycolysis [126] , reducing ROS [127] and restoring calcium homeostasis.Table 2 presents an overview of the level of evidence for creatine supplementation for chronic, atraumatic mitochondrial dysfunction.Figure 3.Warburg Effect: glycolysis produces 2 ATP instead of 36 ATP , in pathological tissues even despite aerobic conditions.

Four disease clusters are associated with NCD such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic pulmonary diseases, and diabetes mellitus [ 129]. NCD are associated with low-grade inﬂammation and an increase in oxidative stress [ 130].Through the past decades, they have become the biggest health threat of modern society [ 131–133].Lately, there has been a link established between NCD and mitochondrial dysfunction.Reduced oxygen consumption rates have been shown in cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.Additionally, they suffer from calcium overload due to mitochondrial calcium mishandling and ROS overproduction [ 134–137].Obesity [ 138–141] as well as diabetes mellitus [ 142–149] are associated with an increased mitochondrial fragmentation rate, impaired ATP production, as well as ROS overproduction and calcium mishandling.
In regards to creatine and its connection to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced levels were detected in human myocytes in diabetes mellitus [ 150], obesity [ 151], and hyper- tension [ 152]. Not surprisingly, NCD are the most common factors contributing to the development of an acute ischemic heart attack or acute ischemic brain disease (Figure 4).Nutrients 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 25 Table 2.Level of evidence for creatine supplementation for chronic, atraumatic mitochondrial dys- function.Study Disease Subject Treatment Randomized Subjects Efficacy Effect Role Guimarães -Ferreira et al.[128] - Ani- mal/vitro 5 g/kg per day for 6 days no 39 Decrease in ROS in muscle tissue Anima model Kato et al.[124] Bipolar disorder Humans None No 25 (disease) vs.21 (con- trol) Abnormal energy phos- phate metabolism in bi- polar disorder No intervention, only descriptive, ob- servational findings 4.

Creatine’s beneﬁts in physical activity and thus counteracting NCD development have been widely explained [ 20,153–163]. There is, however, substantial evidence for the beneﬁcial effects of supplementation even without combining it with sports.The sole intake of creatine has been able to signiﬁcantly lower blood lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides, slow down the development of fatty liver, and lower the HbA1C in human and animal studies, thus improving the clinical outcome and progression of the metabolic syndrome [164–166].Table 3.Level of evidence of creatine’s role in noncommunicable chronic disease.Study Disease Subject Treatment Randomized Subjects Efﬁcacy Effect Role Rider et al.[151]Obesity Human None None 64Deranged cardiac energetics and diastolic dysfunction in obesity groupObservational, disease related changes in metabolism Scheuermann- Freestone et al.

Low ratios have been positively correlated with low contractile function, more severe heart failure symptoms, and a higher risk of mortality [175–177]. Creatine supplementation in patients with chronic heart failure and similar animal studies have not shown any beneﬁcial effect on clinical outcome, neither on myocardial creatine concentrations [ 178–180].The transmembrane Creatine-Transporter (CrT) seems to be the limiting factor in this matter [ 181].Question remains if other creatine-analogues that pass intracellular without the need of CrT might prove of better help in cardiovascular diseases.The energy deﬁciency resulting from local hypoxia during an ischemic heart attack leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn can have arrhythmogenic consequences and lead to sudden cardiac death [ 182–184].Therefore, it is not surprising that creatine Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 9 of 24 plays a critical role during a cardiac ischemic event [ 185,186].
First in vitro studies allow the hypothesis that saturation of myocardial creatine stores may lead to protection in the event of a transient ischemic attack [ 49]. In this context, in animal studies, ﬁlled ATP stores have a positive inotropic, apoptosis-protective effect and counteract a post-ischemic inﬂammatory cascade [187].Intravenous in vivo administration of phosphocreatine was able to confer signiﬁcant myocardial protection after bypass surgery [188], resulting in a reduction in the incidence of ventricular ﬁbrillation and myocardial infarction as well as arrhythmias [ 189].The newly developed special form of creatine, cyclo-creatine, deserves special attention.After an oral loading phase prior to elective cardiac interventions (PCI, ACVB, HTX), cyclo-creatine has a similar protective effect against lethal events [ 183,187,190,191].However, large-scale human studies have yet to conﬁrm the initial promising results.

Mitochondrial health is therefore essential for neurological survival and rehabilitation [ 198,199]. Reperfusion injury is another acute complication feared by medical doctors involving mitochondria and clinical outcomes [ 200,201].Following reper- fusion of the injured brain tissue, excessive ROS and calcium produced under hypoxic conditions are washed in the body’s periphery, causing damage on cellular and molecular level [ 202].Intracellular calcium deregulation enhances neuronal cell death after stroke, giving the stability of the mitochondrial (calcium) permeability transition pore (mPTP) a special predictive measure [203].Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 10 of 24 The acute protective effects of creatine on the central nervous system (CNS) have long been known.Similar to the effect in the myocardium, energy buffering for short- term hypoxic conditions can be achieved by saturating intracellular PCr.
This may lead to protection against ischemia and cell death, as well as calcium gradients created by mechanical stimuli [ 204–206]. In animal experiments, researchers were able to show that idiopathically caused brain damage and spinal cord injuries developed to a lesser extent after creatine oral administration [ 207,208].Creatine supplementation also had a positive effect on infarct sizes after insult in ischemic mouse models [ 209].These results suggest that creatine administration may lead to preventive CNS protection against concussions, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and insults [210].Adding to the above-mentioned protective effects of Creatine during a hypoxic situa- tion, special advantages of creatine on the CNS have been proven.The term excitotoxicity describes the destruction of neuronal cells due to pathological activation of its excitatory receptors [ 202].
Research was able to show that excitatory amino acids, such as Glutamate, become more neurotoxic when the cell’s energy levels are reduced by hypoxia [ 211]. Acti- vation of the glutamate NMDA receptor correlates with reduced ATP and PCr levels [ 212].Creatine was able to protect animal brain tissues from the apoptotic effects of excitatory amino acids [ 213,214].Lastly, it was shown that Creatine stabilizes mPTP in rodent studies, thus protecting brain tissue from apoptosis and cell death [ 67].Table 5 presents a summary of the level of evidence related to creatine supplementation for traumatic and ischemic CNS injuries [205–207].Table 5.Level of evidence for the role of creatine supplementation in individuals with traumatic and ischemic CNS injuries.Study Disease Subject Treatment Randomized Subjects Efﬁcacy Effect Role Zhu et al.

Neurodegenerative Disorders Ageing has been deﬁned as a “progressive accumulation of changes with time that are associated with or responsible for the ever-increasing susceptibility to disease and death” [ 215].Brain tissue is due to its high-energy demands especially vulnerable to mitochondrial deﬁcits, ROS, hypoxia, and energy depletion [ 216,217].Although ROS are of special need to neurons and brain tissue needed for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory function, their overproduction is closely related to nitration of proteins, mtDNA impairment and the development of neurodegenerative diseases, ageing, and cognitive deﬁcits [ 218–220].
Insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus deteriorate these conditions and accelerate cognitive decline as well as incidence of neurogenerative diseases [ 221– 223]. RAGE and ammonium level up the documented damage to mitochondria, neuronal cells, and brain tissue [ 224–226].Alzheimer’s disease has already been named “type 3 diabetes“ [ 227].Pathologically altered mitochondria have been shown to be swollen, have altered membrane potential, and reductions of ATP levels [ 228].Therefore, mitochondrial protection and reduction of oxidative stress have been suggested to be of high therapeutic importance for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders [ 229].Anti-inﬂammatory nutrition, caloric restriction, as well as the use of supplements have been discussed to be improve mitochondrial functioning and cognition [ 230–233].Various studies have also shown that creatine supplementation has a positive effect on cognition and brain function [ 234,235].
The effect was greater the more the participant was exposed to external stressors (e.g., hypoxia, sleep deprivation, etc.) [ 45,205] or the more complex the tasks were performed [ 236]. In this context, intake led to a lower need for sleep, earlier wake-up times, and improved sleep behavior [237].Neurodegenerative diseases are usually characterized by the destruction or dysfunc- tion of neurons in a speciﬁc brain area.Depending on the affected brain area, course, and severity, the forms of the disease differ.These include Alzheimer’s disease (MA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington’s disease (MH), and Parkinson’s disease (MP).Impaired energy balance with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are common to all diseases [ 238].Similar ﬁndings have been made with intellectual disability-related diseases [ 239].This bioenergetic deﬁcit is thought to lead to apoptosis and necrosis and ultimately to neuronal degeneration [ 240].
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that an improvement in mitochondrial health could enable a positive inﬂuence on the course of the disease. Table 6 provides a summary of the level of evidence related to the role of creatine supplementation for neurodegenerative disorders [ 45,234,236].Initial studies suggest that creatine supplementation may be neuroprotective.For example, in 2013, Kley and coworkers [ 241] conducted a Cochrane review on the role of creatine monohydrate supplementation for treating muscle disorders.The researchers found sound evidence from randomized clinical trials that creatine supplementation increased strength and functional capacity in muscular dystrophy and idiopathic inﬂammatory myopathy while having no effect in patients with metabolic-related myopathies and McArdle dis- ease.More long-term research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of creatine in neurodegenerative diseases that impair muscle function.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 12 of 24 Table 6.

Psychological Disorders In the 1980s, a link was established between bioenergetic deﬁcits and depression [ 190, 242–244], bipolar disorders [ 114,245,246], and obsessive–compulsive disorders [ 247,248]. It is believed that there is an increase in energy demand with depletion of PCr stores at the onset of disease [ 124,249].In clinical trials with depressed patients [ 250–252], a positive effect on subjective impairment after adjuvant creatine supplementation could be demon- strated.The higher the increase in cerebral PCr after creatine supplementation, the lower the depressive or manic symptoms [ 253].The combination of antidepressants and creatine was more effective than simple pharmacological medication [ 254].Creatine administration was even effective when drug therapy with SSRIs proved to be ineffective [ 255].In this content, creatine has also been discussed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of drug addiction and its psychic related disorders [ 256].
Positive effects of creatine supple- mentation have also been reported in post-traumatic stress disorders [ 257]. Schizophrenic and stress patients seem to gain no beneﬁt from creatine intake.There is, however, ongoing debate on higher dosage for a needed beneﬁt in these sub-groups [ 258].Table 7 presents a summary of the literature related to the effects of creatine supplementation on individuals with psychological disorders [251,252,255].Table 7.Level of evidence for the role of creatine supplementation in individuals with psychologi- cal disorders.Study Disease Subject Treatment Randomized Subjects Efﬁcacy Effect Role Kondo et al.[250]Adolescent major depressive disorderHuman4 g/d creatine for 8 weeksNone 15Reduction in children-depression symptom scores.Signiﬁcant increase in brain phosphocreatine level.Direct effect on disease (no RCT) Roitman et al.

PCR level improved with higher dose.Potential direct effect on disease 9. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome, and Long COVID Fatigue is the most characteristic symptom of an energy deﬁcit.There does not, how- ever, exist a proper deﬁnition of the fatigue syndrome [ 259].Fibromyalgia is a similar pathological entity closely related to CFS.Initially thought to be purely a psychological problem, linking fatigue to depression or other psychiatric diseases, newer research has been able to prove a metabolic dysfunction causing the symptoms [ 99,260,261].Linking this clinical state with mitochondrial dysfunction was ﬁrst able when lowered mitochondrial ATP levels were shown using MRS on patients with fatigue syndrome [ 262].Later muscle biopsies and serum biomarkers have been able to show reduced mitochondrial biomark- ers [ 263,264].These markers have been Carnitine and CoQ10 [ 265].
On a mitochondrial level fatty acid metabolism was altered, electron transport chain was disrupted, there was a greater need in glucose concentrations and higher levels of lactate were shown [ 266]. Higher creatinine excretion via urine was shown to correlate positively with fatigue and pain severity.Being the end product of creatine, this urine marker could imply a higher turnover and depletion of the body’s creatine storage [ 267].More recent hypotheses state that these alterations have been caused by an activation of immune–inﬂammatory pathways due to viral infections (e.g., Epstein Barr, Q Fever, Ross River Infection) [268].Long COVID is a persistent fatigue state after Sars-2-CoV-2 infection [ 269,270].Inter- estingly, even asymptomatic patients exhibited raised biomarkers involved in inﬂammation and stress response [ 271].Long COVID, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome are believed to be the same entity [ 248,272].
Supplementation of guadinioacteic acid, a precursor of creatine, was able to attenuate several aspects of fatigue in ﬁbromyalgia patients [ 273]. In combination of experimental ﬁndings as well as these ﬁrst promising clinical outcomes, creatine might be an important key in the rehabilitation process of CFS and Long COVID patients [ 274].Table 8 summarizes the available literature on the effects of the creatine precursor GAA on chronic fatigue and Post-COVID syndrome [274].Table 8.Summary of literature on the effects of creatine precursors on chronic fatigue and Post- COVID syndrome.Study Disease Subject Treatment Randomized Subjects Efﬁcacy Effect Role Ostojic et al.[264]Chronic Fatigue syndromeHuman2 g, 4 g oral Guanidi- noacetic Acid for 3 months vs.placeboYes 21Higher muscle creatine-phosphate level and better oxidative capacity.However, no signiﬁcant improvement of fatigue symptomsDirect effect on disease related metabolism Nutrients 2022 ,14, 529 14 of 24 10.
Conclusions This review summarizes creatine’s impact on mitochondrial function besides restoring ATP-storage. Creatine monohydrate is one of the best-known nutrient supplements mainly being used for improvement of athletic performance.However, there is growing evidence for a broader therapeutic spectrum of this nitrogen–amino-compound.Various health- promoting effects on cell-metabolism after the intake of creatine have been shown.Its im- pact on mitochondrial integrity has become of special interest.Mitochondrial dysfunction has become a central pathological hallmark of non-communicable diseases.The supple- mentation of creatine monohydrate may have some synergistic effects in the treatment of CND.This seems to be directly related to its protective effects on mitochondria.Different from pharmaceutical products, the intake of creatine is safe age- and gender-independent with nearly no side-effects [ 49,50].
Although these ﬁndings are promising, much of the available data has been generated with in vitro or animal studies. Therefore, there is a need to conduct more clinical trials in humans to assess the potential therapeutic effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation on conditions inﬂuencing mitochondrial function.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, R.P .M.; writing—original draft preparation, R.P .M.; writing—review and editing, R.P .M., J.-N.D., J.G., and R.B.K.; funding acquisition, R.P .M.All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.Funding: The APC of selected papers of this special issue are being funded by AlzChem, LLC.(Trostberg, Germany) who manufactures creatine monohydrate.The funders had no role in the writing of the manuscript, interpretation of the literature, or in the decision to publish the results.Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.
