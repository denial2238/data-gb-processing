Therefore, vitamin de ﬁciency leads to increased risk of developing infectious, allergic, and inﬂammatory d iseases. Since B vitamins are synthesizedbyplants,yeasts,andbacteria,butnotbymamm als,mammalsmustacquire B vitamins from dietary or microbial sources, such as the int estinal microbiota.Similarly, someintestinalbacteriaareunabletosynthesizeBvitamin sandmustacquirethemfrom the host diet or from other intestinal bacteria for their gro wth and survival.This suggests that the composition and function of the intestinal microbi ota may affect host B vitamin usage and, by extension, host immunity.Here, we review the i mmunological functions of B vitamins and their metabolism by intestinal bacteria wi th respect to the control of host immunity.
Keywords: absorption, gut microbiota, intestinal immunity, n utrition, vitamin INTRODUCTION The gut is continuously exposed both to toxic (e.g., pathogeni c microorganisms) and beneﬁcial (e.g., dietary components, commensal bacteria) compounds an d microorganisms; therefore, the intestinalimmunesystemmustmaintainahealthybalancebe tweenactiveandsuppressiveimmune responses.Thisbalanceiscontrollednotonlybyhostimmune factorssuchascytokinesbutalsobya varietyofenvironmentalfactorssuchasdietarycomponents andthecompositionofthecommensal bacteria. Furthermore, several lines of evidence have demo nstrated that immune homeostasis in the intestine is related not only to intestinal health but al so to the health of the whole body ( 1– 3).Therefore, immune regulation by environmental factors i s attracting attention as a means of maintainingimmunologicalhealthandpreventingmanydisea ses.Nutrients are essential for the development, maintenance, a nd function of the host immune system (4,5).
Vitamins are essential micronutrients that are synthesi zed by bacteria, yeasts, and plants, but not by mammals. Therefore, mammals must obtain vita mins from the diet or rely on theirsynthesisbycommensalbacteriainthegastrointesti naltract.Somevitaminsarewater-soluble (e.g.,vitaminBfamilyandvitaminC),whereasothersarefa t-soluble(e.g.,vitaminsA,D,E,andK).Water-solublevitaminsarenotstoredbythebodyandanyexce ssisexcretedintheurine;therefore, it is important to consume a diet containing the necessary amo unts of these vitamins.Vitamin Yoshii et al.Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity deﬁciency associated with insuﬃcient dietary intake occur s not onlyindeveloping countriesbutalsoindeveloped countriesa sa resultofincreaseduseofunbalanceddiet( 6).Inadditiontothediet,thecommensalbacteriaarerecogniz ed asimportantplayersinthecontrolofhosthealth( 7–9).Fromthe pointofviewofvitamins,commensalbacteriaarebothprovide rs and consumers of B vitamins and vitamin K.
Although dietary B vitamins are generally absorbed through the small intesti ne, bacterial B vitamins are produced and absorbed mainly throug h the colon ( 10,11), indicating that dietary and gut microbiota- derivedBvitaminsarepossiblyhandleddiﬀerentlybythehuman body. B vitamins are important cofactors and coenzymes in several metabolic pathways, and it has been reported recently that B vitamins also play important roles in the maintenance of immune homeostasis ( 12,13).Thus, both dietary components and the gut microbiota modulate host immune function via B vitamins.Here, we review the metabolism and function of dietary and gut microbiota-derived B vitamins in the contro l of hostimmunity.VITAMIN B1 Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is a cofactor for several enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,whicharebothinvolvedinthetricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ( 14,15).
World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommend a daily vitamin B1 intake of 1.1–1.2mg for adult ( 16). Vitamin B1 deﬁciency causes lethargy and, if left untreated, can devel op into beriberi, a disease that aﬀects the peripheral nervous system and cardiovascular system.Accumulating evidence suggests that energy metabolism—particularly the balance between glycolysis and the TCA cycle—is associated with the functional control of immune cells, in what is now referred t o as immunometabolism( 17).Immunometabolism is well studied in T cells and macrophages; quiescent or regulatory-type cells (e.g., naiv e T cells, Treg cells, and M2 macrophages) use the TCA cycle for energy generation, whereas activated or pro-inﬂammatory cells (e.g., Th1, Th2, Th17, and M1 macrophages) use glycolysis( 18,19).
Previously, we examined B cell immunometabolism in the intestine.Intheintestine,naïveimmunoglobulin(Ig)M+Bcells diﬀerentiate into IgA+B cells in Peyer’s patches (PPs) by class switching,andthenIgA+BcellsdiﬀerentiateintoIgA-producing plasma cells in the intestinal lamina propria ( 20). Naïve B cells in PPs preferentially use a vitamin B1-dependent TCA cycle for the generation of ATP.However, once the B cells diﬀerentiate into IgA-producing plasma cells, they switch to using glycoly sis for the generation of ATP and shift to a catabolic pathway for the production of IgA antibody ( Figure1).Consistent with the importance of vitamin B1 in the maintenance of the TCA cycle, micefedavitaminB1-deﬁcientdietshowimpairedmaintenanc e ofnaïveBcellsinPPs,withlittleeﬀectonIgA-producingplasm a cells.Since PPs are the primary sites of induction of antigen - speciﬁc IgA responses, PP regression induced by vitamin B1deﬁciency leads to decreased IgA antibody responses to oral vaccines( 21).
Vitamin B1 is found in high concentrations as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in meat (particularly pork and chicken); eggs; cereal sprouts and rice bran; and beans. Dietary TPP is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase and converted to free thiamine in the small intestine ( 22).Free thiamine is absorbed by the intestinal epithelium via thiamine transporters (e.g., THTR-1, THTR-2) and transported to the blood for distribution throughoutthebody( 11).FreethiamineisconvertedbacktoTPP andisusedforenergymetabolismintheTCAcycle.Various types of intestinal bacteria, mostly in the colon, al so produce vitamin B1 as both free thiamine and TPP ( 11,23).In the colon, free bacterial thiamine is absorbed mainly by thiamine transporters, transported to the blood, and distribu ted throughout the body; this mechanism is similar to how free dietary thiamine is taken up in the small intestine.
However , unlikeinthesmallintestine,TPPproducedbythegutmicrobi ota is not converted to free thiamine, because alkaline phosphatas e is not secreted in the colon ( 24). Instead, TPP is absorbed directly by the colon via TPP transporters (e.g., TPPT-1) that are highly expressed on the apical membrane of the colon (25).The absorbed TPP enters the mitochondria via MTPP-1, a TPP transporter that is expressed in the mitochondrial inner membraneandisusedasacofactorforATPgeneration( 26).This suggests that bacterial TPP is important for energy generati on in thecolon.Thus,dietaryandbacterialvitaminB1appearstoha ve diﬀerentrolesinthehost.
The vitamin B1 structure consists of a thiazole moiety linked toapyrimidinemoiety.Bacteriaobtainthethiazolemoietyf rom glycine or tyrosine and 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate, and plantsandyeastssynthesizeitfromglycineand2-pentulose( 27– 30).Inbothbacteriaandplants,thepyrimidinemoietyisderive d from 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide, an intermediate in t he purine pathway ( 29). Metagenomic analyses of the human gut microbiota predict that Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri (phylum Bacteroidetes); Clostridium diﬃcile , someLactobacillus spp., and Ruminococcus lactaris (Firmicutes); Biﬁdobacterium spp.(Actinobacteria); and Fusobacterium varium are vitamin B1 producers ( Table1) (10,46), implying that many intestinal bacteriapossessacompletevitaminB1synthesispathway,which includes pathways for the synthesis of thiazole and pyrimidin e.Indeed, Lactobacillus casei produces thiamine during the production of fermented milk drinks ( 31), andBiﬁdobacterium infantisandB.
biﬁdum produce thiamine in culture supernatant (32).However, Faecalibacterium spp.(Firmicutes)lackavitamin B1 synthesis pathway even though they require vitamin B1 for their growth ( 10). Therefore, these bacteria must obtain their vitamin B1 from other bacteria or from the host diet via a thiamine transporter, suggesting that there is competition f or vitaminB1betweenthehostandcertainintestinalbacteria .VITAMIN B2 Vitamin B2 (riboﬂavin) and its active forms (ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide [FAD] and ﬂavin mononucleotide [FMN]) are Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 48 Yoshii et al.Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity FIGURE 1 | Vitamin B1 and B2-mediated immunometabolism in B cell diffe rentiation in the intestine.Vitamin B1 acts as a cofactor fo r enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase that are involved in the TCA c ycle.
Vitamin B2 acts as a cofactor for enzymes such as succin ate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in fatty acid oxi dation (FAO, also known as β-oxidation). Naïve B cells preferentially use the TCA cycle for efﬁcient energy generation.Once B cells are activated to differenti ate into IgA-producing plasma cells, they utilize glycolysi s for the production of IgA antibody.cofactors for enzymatic reactions in the TCA cycle and in fat ty acid oxidization (also known as β-oxidization) ( 15).WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B2 intake of 1.0–1.3mg for adults (16).Vitamin B2 deﬁciency suppresses the activity of acyl- CoA dehydrogenases involved in the oxidation of fatty acids to generate acetyl-CoA, which is used by mitochondria to produc e ATP via the TCA cycle.Fatty acid oxidization is involved in the activation, diﬀerentiation, and proliferation of immun e cells through the generation of acetyl-CoA and its entry int o TCA cycle ( 47).
This suggests that vitamin B2 is associated with the control of diﬀerentiation and function of immune cells through regulation of fatty acid oxidization ( Figure1); however, the immunological roles of vitamin B2 in the contro l of host immunity remain to be investigated. In addition to energy generation, vitamin B2 is associated with reactive o xygen species(ROS)generationinimmunecellsthroughtheprimingof NADPHoxidase2( 48);ROSareimportanteﬀectorandsignaling moleculesininﬂammationandimmunity.Vitamin B2 is found at high levels in leafy green vegetables, liver, and eggs.Dietary vitamin B2 exists as FAD or FMN and is converted to free riboﬂavin by FAD pyrophosphatase and FMN phosphatase in the small intestine ( 49,50).Free riboﬂavin is absorbed via riboﬂavin transporter expressed on the epitheliu m of the small intestine and is then released into the blood.In the blood, free riboﬂavin is converted back to FAD or FMN and distributedthroughoutthebody( 51–53).
Bacterial vitamin B2 is synthesized from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and D-ribulose 5-phosphate ( 54). Bacterial vitamin B2 exists as free riboﬂavin, which is directly absor bed in the large intestine, converted to FAD or FMN, and distributed throughout the body as described above ( 23).A metagenome analysis of the human gut microbiota by Magnúsdóttir et al.(10) has predicted that Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri (Bacteroidetes); Clostridium diﬃcile ,Lactobacillus plantarum ,L.fermentum , andRuminococcus lactaris (Firmicutes) express factors essential for vitamin B2 synthesis, suggesting that these bacteria are an important source of vitamin B2 in the large intestine ( Table1).In contrast, Biﬁdobacterium spp., and Collinsella spp.(Actinobacteria) lack a vitamin B2 pathway.Supplementation of fermented soymilk containing Lactobacillus plantarum with riboﬂavin deﬁcient diet has been shown to promote vitamin B2 production and prevent vitamin B2 deﬁciency in mice ( 35).L.
fermentum isolated from sourdough can synthesize riboﬂavin in vitro (36). Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that some species in Bacteroidetes phylum produce more riboﬂavin than do Actinobacteria and Firmicute s phyla (55).However, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes phyla still express riboﬂavin transporter and the enzymes necessar y for FAD and FMN generation from free riboﬂavin (i.e., FAD synthases and ﬂavin kinases) ( 10,56), suggesting that all bacteria, including those that are unable to synthesize vit amin B2 themselves, require FAD and FMN for their growth and survival.Thus,aswithvitaminB1,thereislikelycompetitio nfor riboﬂavinbetweenthehostandthecommensalbacteria.In addition to being able to produce vitamin B2, some bacteria (e.g., commensals such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis andSalmonella typhimurium ) produce the vitamin B2 intermediate ( 57–59), 6- hydroxymethyl-8- D-ribityllumazine ( 60,61).
6-Hydroxymethyl- 8-D-ribityllumazine binds to major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MR1) on antigen-presenting cells; this causes mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) ce lls, an abundant population of innate-like T cells, to produce cytokines such as interferon gamma and interleukin (IL) 17, which contribute to host defense against pathogens ( Figure2) (62). It is thought that stimulation by commensal bacteria contributes to the development and activation of MAIT cells for immunological surveillance against pathogens.MAIT cells Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 48 Yoshii et al.Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity TABLE 1 | Vitamin B family producing bacteria.

VITAMIN B3 Vitamin B3 (niacin) is generally known as nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. These compounds are precursors of nicotinamid e adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a coenzyme in the cellular redox reaction with a central role in aerobic respiration.WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B3 intake of 11–12mg for adults(16).Vitamin B3 is also a ligand of GPR109a, a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on several types of cells, including immune cells(64).VitaminB3–GPR109asignalinginducesdiﬀerentiation of regulatory T cells and suppresses colitis in a GPR109a- dependentmanner( 65).VitaminB3alsoinhibitstheproduction ofthepro-inﬂammatorycytokinesIL-1,IL-6,andtumornecro sis factoralpha(TNF- α)bymacrophagesandmonocytes( Figure3) (66).Thus, vitamin B3 has anti-inﬂammatory properties by modulating host immune cells and playing an important role in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis.
Indeed, in humans,vitaminB3deﬁciencycausespellagra,whichisadiseas e characterized by intestinal inﬂammation, diarrhea, derma titis, anddementia( 67). Unlike the other B vitamins, vitamin B3 can be generated by mammals via an endogenous enzymatic pathway from tryptophan and is stored in the liver, although it is also obtain ed from the diet ( 68).Animal-based foods such as ﬁsh and meat contain vitamin B3 as nicotinamide, and plant-based foods su ch asbeanscontainvitaminB3asnicotinicacid.Bothnicotina mide and nicotinic acid are directly absorbed through the small intestine,wherenicotinicacidisconvertedtonicotinami de.Vitamin B3 is also synthesized from tryptophan by intestinal bacteria ( 69,70).Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri (Bacteroidetes); Ruminococcus lactaris ,Clostridium diﬃcile (Firmicutes); Biﬁdobacterium infantis (Actinobacteria); Helicobacter pylori (Proteobacteria); and Fusobacterium varium (Fusobacteria) possess a vitamin B3 biosynthesis pathway (Table1) (10,71).
Thus, many intestinal bacteria from various genera can produce vitamin B3, suggesting that both dietary and commensal bacteria-derived vitamin B3 are important for hostimmunity. VITAMIN B5 Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is a precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), which is an essential cofactor for the TCA cycle and fa tty acid oxidation ( 72).WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B5 intake of 5.0mg for adults ( 16).Like vitamins B1 and B2, vitamin B5 is involved in the control of host immunity via energygenerationbyimmunecells.VitaminB5deﬁciencycause s immune diseases such as dermatitis, as well as non-immune- related conditions such as fatigue and insomnia ( 73).In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adu lts, dietary supplementation with vitamin B5 was shown to improve facial acne ( 74), suggesting that epithelial barrier function Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 48 Yoshii et al.
Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity FIGURE 2 | Regulation of MAIT cells by microbial metabolites derived fr om vitamin B2 and B9. Commensal bacteria/pathogens produce t he vitamin B2 metabolite 6-hydroxymethyl-8-D-ribityllumazine.It binds to major hi stocompatibility complex (MHC) related protein (MR1) on an tigen-presenting cells, which activate mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells to promote the productio n of inﬂammatory cytokines such as IFN- γand IL-17.These reactions contribute to defense against pathogens and conversely are associated with inﬂammation.In contrast, the vitamin B9 metabolite acetyl-6-formylpteri n binds as an antagonist to MR1, thus inhibiting the activation of MAIT cells.FIGURE 3 | Pivotal roles of vitamins B3, B7, and B9 in maintenance of imm unological homeostasis.
Vitamin B3 binds to GPR109a in dend ritic cells and macrophages, and GPR109a signaling leads to an increase in a nti-inﬂammatory properties, resulting in differentiation into regulatory T cells (Treg). Vitamin B7 binds to histones and, by histone biotinylation, suppresses the sec retion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.Once naïve T cells diff erentiate into Treg cells, they highly express folate receptor 4 (FR4).Consistent with this ﬁnding, vitamin B9 is r equired for the survival of Treg cells.improves via the promotion of keratinocyte proliferation and diﬀerentiation into ﬁbroblasts ( 75).To maintain vitamin B5 levels during times of deﬁciency, CoA is converted back to vitamin B5 or cysteamine via pantetheine ( 76).However,cysteamine inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated rec eptor gamma (PPAR γ) signaling, causing inﬂammation ( 77).Indeed, colitis has been improved in pantetheine-producing-enzyme knockout mice ( 78).
Thus, vitamin B5 deﬁciency causes Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 48 Yoshii et al. Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity inﬂammation through both dysfunction of the epithelial barr ier andtheproductionofpro-inﬂammatorymolecules.In terms of immune responses, vitamin B5 enhances protective activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection bypromotinginnateimmunityandadaptiveimmunity.Inmice, vitaminB5supplementationactivatesphagocytosisandcytoki ne production (including IL-6 and TNF- α) by macrophages and subsequentlypromotesTh1andTh17responsesfortheclearanc e ofM.tuberculosis from the lungs ( 79).Thus, vitamin B5 contributes to host defense by activating immune responses, suggesting that this vitamin has an important role as a naturaladjuvant.Vitamin B5 is found in high concentrations as CoA or phosphopantetheine in liver, eggs, chicken, and fermented soybeans.
CoA and phosphopantetheine are converted to free pantothenic acid by endogenous enzymes such as phosphatase and pantetheinase in the small intestine. Free pantothenic ac id is absorbed via sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) expressed on the epithelium of the small intestine and isthenreleasedintotheblood( 80).Finally,freepantothenicacid is converted back to CoA and distributed throughout the body , particularlytotheliverandkidney.Bacterial vitamin B5 is synthesized from 2-dihydropantoate andβ-alanine via de novo synthesis pathways ( 10).Bacterial vitamin B5 exists as free pantothenic acid, which is directly absorbed in the large intestine, converted to CoA, and distributed in the same way as dietary vitamin B5.According to a genomic analysis, Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri (Bacteroidetes); some Ruminococcus spp.(R.lactaris andR.
torques)(Firmicutes); Salmonellaenterica andHelicobacterpylori (Proteobacteria) possess a vitamin B5 biosynthesis pathway, indicating that intestinal commensal bacteria can produce vitamin B5. In contrast, most Fusobacterium (Fusobacteria) andBiﬁdobacterium spp.(Actinobacteria) and some strains of Clostridiumdiﬃcile ,Faecalibacterium spp.,andLactobacillus spp.(Firmicutes) lack such a pathway ( Table1), although some of them do express pantothenic acid transporter to utilize vitami n B5 for energy generation ( 10), suggesting that these bacteria competewiththehostforvitaminB5.VITAMIN B6 Vitamin B6 exists in several forms, including as pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine.These forms of vitamin B6 are precursors of the coenzymes pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP), which are involved in a variety of cellular metabolic processes, including amino acid, lipid , and carbohydrate metabolism ( 81).
WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B6 intake of 1.3–1.7mg for adults ( 16). Vitamin B6 deﬁciency is associated with the development of inﬂammatory diseases such as allergy and rheumatoid arthritis, as well a s with neuronaldysfunction( 82–84).VitaminB6deﬁciencydisruptsthe Th1–Th2 balance toward an excessive Th2 response, resulting in allergy (85).Moreover, low plasma vitamin B6 levels, together with increased levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-αandIL-6,havebeenobservedinpatientswithrheumatoidarthritis( 86).However,themechanismunderlyingtheregulation of inﬂammation by vitamin B6 is currently unknown.Vitamin B6 contributes to intestinal immune regulation through the metabolismofthelipidmediatorsphingosine1-phosphate(S1P).S1Pregulateslymphocytetraﬃckingintotheintestines,espe cially inthelargeintestine.LymphocytetraﬃckingisdependentonS 1P gradientwhichiscreatedbyS1Pproductionanditsdegradati on.S1P degradation is mediated by S1P lyase that requires vitam in B6 as a cofactor.
The administration of vitamin B6 antagonis t impairs S1P lyase activity and creates an inappropriate S1P gradient, resulted in impairing lymphocyte migration from lymphoid tissues and reducing the numbers of lymphocytes in the intestines ( 87). The lymphocytes located between gut epithelial cells are known as intraepithelial cells (IELs) whic h are involved in the protection against pathogens ( 88).Therefore, vitamin B6 is important role for immunosurveillance in theintestines.Vitamin B6 is abundant in ﬁsh, chicken, tofu, sweet potato, and avocado.
Dietary vitamin B6 exists as PLP or PMP; it is converted to free vitamin B6 by endogenous enzymes such as pyridoxal phosphatase and is then absorbed by the small intestine.AlthoughabsorptionofvitaminB6throughacidic pH- dependent and carrier-mediated transport has been shown, an intestinal pyridoxine transporter is yet to be identiﬁed in an y mammalianspecies( 11).AftertheabsorptionoffreevitaminB6, itentersthebloodandisconvertedbacktoPLPorPMP. Microbial vitamin B6 is synthesized as PLP from deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate and 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine orfromglyceraldehyde-3-phosphateand D-ribulose5-phosphate (10).In the large intestine, bacteria-derived PLP is converte d to free vitamin B6, which is absorbed by passive transport, transportedtotheblood,anddistributedthroughoutthebody .
Metagenomic analysis has shown that Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri (Bacteroidetes), Biﬁdobacterium longum and,Collinsella aerofaciens (Actinobacteria), and Helicobacter pylori(Proteobacteria) possess a vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway. Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria likely produce vitamin B6 starting from deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate and 4- phosphohydroxy- L-threonine, whereas Actinobacteria likely start from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and D-ribulose 5- phosphate.In contrast, most Firmicutes genera ( Veillonella , Ruminococcus ,Faecalibacterium , and Lactobacillus spp.), except for some Clostridium (C.bartlettii ,C.leptum, C.methylpentosum , andC.sporogenes ) andLactobacillus spp.(L.brevisandL.ruminis ) lack a vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway (10)(Table1).VITAMIN B7 Vitamin B7 (biotin) is a cofactor for several carboxylases t hat are essential for glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid metabo lism (89).
For example, vitamin B7 is an essential cofactor for acetyl - CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, which are enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis ( 90,91). Thus, vitamin B7 likely inﬂuences immunometabolism.WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B7 intake of 30 µg for adults ( 16).Vitamin Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 48 Yoshii et al.Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity B7 suppresses gene expression by binding to (biotinylating) histones; these genes include that encoding NF- κB, which is a major signaling molecule for the production of several pro- inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, I L- 1, IL-6, IL-8) ( 92,93).Nuclear transcription of NF- κB is activated in response to vitamin B7 deﬁciency ( 94), suggesting that biotinylation of histones suppresses the expression of genes encoding pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in NF- κB signaling (Figure3).
Therefore, vitamin B7 has anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects byinhibitingNF- κBactivation,anddietaryvitaminB7deﬁciency causes inﬂammatory responses via enhanced secretion of pro- inﬂammatorycytokines( 95,96). Vitamin B7 is abundant in foods such as nuts, beans, and oilseed.However, raw egg-white contains a large amount of avidin, which binds strongly to vitamin B7 and prevents its absorption in the gut ( 97).Therefore, vitamin B7 deﬁciency can be caused not only by insuﬃcient vitamin B7 intake, but also b y excessive intake of raw egg-white.Dietary biotin exists as a free protein-bound form or as biocytin ( 11).In the small intestine, biotinidase releases free biotin from the bound protein and t he freebiotinisabsorbedviathebiotintransporterSMVT( 98).Vitamin B7 is also produced by intestinal bacteria as free biotin synthesized from malonyl CoA or pimelate via pimeloyl-CoA ( 99,100).Bacterial free biotin is absorbed by SMVT expressed in the colon ( 23,101).
Metagenomic analysis has shown that Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri(Bacteroidetes); Fusobacterium varium (Fusobacteria) andCampylobacter coli (Proteobacteria) possess a vitamin B7 biosynthesis pathway ( 10). In contrast, Prevotella spp.(Bacteroidetes), Biﬁdobacterium spp.(Actinobacteria), and Clostridium ,Ruminococcus ,Faecalibacterium , andLactobacillus spp.(Firmicutes) lack such a pathway ( Table1); however, they do express free biotin transporter ( 10,102), suggesting that these bacteria also utilize dietary and bacterial vitamin B 7 and therefore may compete with the host.Thus, free biotin may inﬂuencethecompositionofthegutmicrobiota,becausebiot inis necessary for the growth and survival of the microbiota.Ind eed, biotin deﬁciency leads to gut dysbiosis and the overgrowth o f Lactobacillus murinus , leading to the development of alopecia (103).
Furthermore, vitamin B7 production appears to proceed in a cooperative manner among diﬀerent intestinal bacteria; Biﬁdobacteriumlongum intheintestineproducespimelate,which isaprecursorofvitaminB7thatenhancesvitaminB7productio n byotherintestinalbacteria( 104). VITAMIN B9 Vitamin B9 (folate), in its active form as tetrahydrofolate , is a cofactor in several metabolic reactions, including DNA and amino acid synthesis.WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B9 intake of 400 µg for adults ( 16).Owing to the high requirement of vitamin B9 by red blood cells, vitamin B9 deﬁciency leads to megaloblastic anemia ( 23).Vitamin B9 deﬁciency also inhibits the proliferation of human CD8+T cells in vitroby arresting the cell cycle in the S phase and increasing the frequency of DNA damage ( 105).Moreover, vitamin B9contributes to the maintenance of immunologic homeostasis.Regulatory T cells (Treg) express high levels of vitamin B9 receptor (folate receptor 4 [FR4]).
Administration of anti-FR4 antibody results in speciﬁc reduction in the Treg cell populatio n (106), suggesting that the vitamin B9–FR4 axis is required for Tregcellmaintenance. InvitrocultureofTregcellsundervitamin B9-reduced conditions leads to impaired cell survival, with decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 molecules, althou gh naïve T cells retain the ability to diﬀerentiate into Treg cell s; this suggests that vitamin B9 is a survival factor for Treg ce lls (87).Consistentwiththeseﬁndings,deﬁciencyofdietaryvita min B9 results in reduction of the Treg cell population in the small intestine ( 107,108).Since Treg cells play an important role in the prevention of excessive immune responses ( 109), mice fed a vitamin B9-deﬁcient diet exhibit increased susceptibilit y to intestinalinﬂammation( 107).Foods such as beef liver, green leafy vegetables, and asparag us contain high levels of vitamin B9.
Vitamin B9 exists as both mono- and polyglutamate folate species in the diet ( 110). Folate polyglutamate is deconjugated to the monoglutamate form and then absorbed in the small intestine via folate transporters such as proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) ( 11,111).In the intestinal epithelium, folate monoglutamate is convert ed to tetrahydrofolate(THF),anactiveformandcofactor,befor ebeing transportedtotheblood( 111).Intestinal bacteria synthesize vitamin B9 as THF from GTP, erythrose 4-phosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate ( 38,112).Bacterial THF is directly absorbed in the colon via PCFT and distributed through the body by the blood ( 113).Metagenomic analysis has shown that Bacteroides fragilis andPrevotella copri (Bacteroidetes); Clostridium diﬃcile ,Lactobacillus plantarum , L.reuteri ,L.
delbrueckii ssp.bulgaricus , andStreptococcus thermophilus (Firmicutes), some species in Biﬁdobacterium spp (Actinobacteria); Fusobacterium varium (Fusobacteria) and Salmonellaenterica (Proteobacteria)possessafolatebiosynthesis pathway ( Table1) (10,40). This suggests that almost all species in all phyla produce folate.Indeed, dietary supplementation withBiﬁdobacterium probiotic strains ( B.adolescentis and B.pseudocatenulatum ) enhances folate production in the large intestine of folate-deﬁcient rats and folate-free cu lture medium ( 38,41,114).Furthermore, Lactobacillus plantarum , L.delbrueckii ssp.bulgaricus , andL.reuteri enhance folate production in bacterial culture supernatant lacking the componentsneededforfolatesynthesis( 38,39,115).In commensal bacteria, a vitamin B9 metabolite, 6- formylpterin (6-FP), is produced by photodegradation of folic acid ( 116).
Like the vitamin B2 metabolite 6- hydroxymethyl-8- D-ribityllumazine, 6-FP binds to MR1, but unlike 6-hydroxymethyl-8- D-ribityllumazine it cannot activate MAIT cells ( 62,117). An analog of 6-FP, acetyl-6-FP, is anantagonistofMR1,whichinhibitsMAITcellactivation( 118).As mentioned in the section on vitamin B2, 6-hydroxymethyl-8 - D-ribityllumazine activates MAIT cells, which provide defense against pathogens, so vitamin B9 metabolites may suppress excess MAIT cell responses and prevent excessive allergic and inﬂammatory responses ( Figure2).The quantitative balance between dietary vitamin B2 and B9 and the composition of Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 48 Yoshii et al.Vitamin B Family and Host Immunity FIGURE 4 | Schematic representation of B-vitamin-mediated interact ion between commensal bacteria and host immunity.
the microbiota and its ability to metabolize these vitamins may be keys to understanding MAIT-cell-mediated homeostasis in theintestine. VITAMIN B12 Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a cobalt-containing vitamin tha t, in its active forms of methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalam in, catalyzes methionine synthesis ( 119).WHO/FAO recommends a daily vitamin B12 intake of 2.4 µg for adults ( 16).Together with vitamin B6 and B9, vitamin B12 plays important roles in red blood cell formation and nucleic acid synthesis, especially in neurons.Therefore, vitamin B12 deﬁciency cau ses megaloblastic anemia and nervous system symptoms such as numbness of the hands and feet ( 119).In terms of host immunity, dietary vitamin B12 deﬁciency decreases the number of CD8+T cells and suppresses natural killer T- cell activity in mice; supplementation with methylcobalamin improves these conditions ( 120), suggesting that vitamin B12 contributestotheimmuneresponseviaCD8+Tcellsandnatural killerTcells.
Beef liver, bivalves, ﬁsh, chicken, and eggs contain high le vels of vitamin B12. Dietary vitamin B12 exists in complex with dietaryproteinandisdecomposedtofreevitaminB12bypepsin in the stomach.Free vitamin B12 is absorbed by the epithelial cells of the small intestine via intrinsic factor (IF), a gas tric glycoprotein.Inside the epithelial cells, IF-vitamin B12 co mplex isdecomposedtofreevitaminB12bylysosomeandthenrelease d into the blood, where it is converted to the active form and distributedthroughoutthebody( 121,122).Bacterial vitamin B12 is synthesized from precorrin- 2 to produce adenosylcobalamin ( 10), which is absorbed directly by the large intestine and distributed throughout the body; the mechanism underlying this absorption is currently unclear.
Metagenomic analysis has predicted that Bacteroides fragilisandPrevotella copri (Bacteroidetes); Clostridium diﬃcile,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii andRuminococcus lactaris (Firmicutes); Biﬁdobacterium animalis ,B.infantis, andB.longum (Actinobacteria); Fusobacterium varium (Fusobacteria) possess a vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathway(Table1) (10,32,42,43,45). Indeed, Lactobacillus plantarum andL.coryniformis isolated from fermented food produce vitamin B12 ( 33), andBiﬁdobacterium animalis synthesizes vitaminB12duringmilkfermentation( 123).CONCLUSION B-vitamin-mediated immunological regulation is speciﬁc to diﬀerent immune cells and immune responses: that is, diﬀerentBvitaminsarerequiredfordiﬀerentimmuneresponses (Figure4).It was once thought that B vitamins were obtained only from the diet; however, we know now that this is not the case and that the intestinal microbiota is also an important source of vitamins.
Within the intestinal microbiota, not a ll bacteria produce B vitamins and some bacteria utilize dietar y B vitamins or B vitamins produced by other intestinal bacteri a for their own needs; therefore, there may be competition between the host and the intestinal microbiota for B vitamin s (Figure4). Research in this ﬁeld is complicated, because not only does the composition of the intestinal microbiota vary among individuals, but also the composition of the diet can alter both the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota.Therefore, vitamin-mediated immunological maintenance also varies among individuals.Further examinations in this ﬁeld are needed, and the new information uncovered will help to develop a new era of precision health andnutrition.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS KYandKHwrotethedraftofreviewarticlewhichwascorrecte d byJK.KY,KH,andKSdrewﬁguresandJKperformedcorrection.
