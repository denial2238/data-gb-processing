The effects of XG and CA concentrations on the physicochemical properties and digestive characteristics of the emul- sions were also investigated.
The addition of XG and CA improved the SPI aggregation and increased its electrostatic repulsion so that more SPI was adsorbed at the phase interface. The emulsifying activity index and emulsifying stability index increased to 24.09 (XG 0.4%) and 14.00 (CA 0.5%) and 151.08 (XG 0.4%) and 135.34 (CA 0.5%), respectively.The adsorbed protein content increased to 88.90% (XG 0.4%) and 88.23% (CA 0.5%), respectively.Moreover, the encapsulation efﬁciencies of vitamin B 12 and vitamin E were increased to 86.72% (XG 0.4%) and 86.47 (CA 0.5%) and 86.31% (XG 0.4%) and 85.78% (CA 0.5%), respectively.The bioaccessibility of vitamin B 12and vitamin E increased to 73.53% (XG 0.4%) and 71.32% (CA 0.5%) and 68.86% (XG 0.4%) and 68.74% (CA 0.5%).The best properties of the emulsions were obtained at a 0.4% concentration of XG and 0.5% of CA.This study offers a novel system for delivering bioactive substances, which is favorable for the advancement of food with delivery capability in food processing.

Introduction W/O/W emulsion has a multi-membrane and three-phase structure composed of inter- nal water phase (W 1), oil phase (O), and external water phase (W 2).It exerts a better effect on the encapsulation and slow release of hydrophilic/lipophilic bioactive substances [ 1].This emulsion has great prospects in the food, medicine, and cosmetics fields.Macromolecular hydrophilic emulsifiers can effectively improve the stability of this system [2].The application of W/O/W emulsion is limited due to the fact that it is a thermody- namically unstable system.Improving the stability of this emulsion has become a research hotspot [ 3].Researchers currently prefer to investigate a protein-based W/O/W emulsion with a greater stability.Soybean protein isolate (SPI) is a rich source of high-grade plant protein with good emulsiﬁcation properties and is often used to prepare emulsions [ 4].
At present, consumers’ demand for plant-based proteins is beginning to increase. Legumes are widely available and are also a rich source of protein, making the legume-based delivery system a sustainable, high quality, healthful, hypoallergenic, and environmentally friendly ingredient [ 5].The high sensitivity of legumes to extreme external environments, such as ions, pH, and temperature, has limited their application in the food industry.Polysaccha- rides can be easily obtained, have good physicochemical properties, are environmentally friendly, and are widely used [ 6].Therefore, they are often used to form more stable Foods 2023 ,12, 4361.https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12234361 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 2 of 16 complexes with the SPI.These stable complexes are helpful for preparing the emulsion and improving its stability.Xanthan gum (XG) is a microbial anionic polysaccharide.
Because of its molecular structure, XG possesses many excellent properties, including high viscosity, unique rheo- logical properties, and excellent freeze–thaw stability, and is often used in frozen foods [ 7]. Carrageenan (CA) is a linear sulfated anionic polysaccharide extracted from red seaweed.It has many types because of its structural diversity.It also has emulsiﬁcation, gelation, thickening, and ﬁlm-forming properties, and therefore, CA can be utilized in the food ﬁeld as a gellant, emulsiﬁer, thickener, and suspending agent [ 8].Using whey protein and pectin as emulsiﬁers improved the properties and protection of bioactive substances of the W/O/W emulsion [ 9].Klojdova et al.[ 10] studied CA and showed that it prevented the aggregation of double milk emulsion droplets, thereby preventing coalescence and increasing the encapsulation efﬁciency.Both Brito-Oliveira et al.[ 11] and Liu et al.
[ 12] used legume proteins with XG/CA to prepare emulsion gels for the delivery of curcumin. However, the current research on the characteristics of W/O/W emulsions delivering bioactive substances is more inclined to delivering a single bioactive substance in the W1or O.Therefore, the advantage of these emulsions to simultaneously deliver bioactive substances with different solubilities has not been effectively utilized.Only a few studies have evaluated the possibility of these emulsions as synergistic delivery systems.By using protein fibrils and nanocrystals, Cui et al.[ 13] improved the structural properties and bioavailability of a W/O/W emulsion encapsulating curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate.Therefore, this study used XG and CA to form complexes with the SPI and improve the properties of W/O/W emulsions.Then, we investigated the effects of co-delivery of vitamin B 12(a hydrophilic bioactive substance) and vitamin E (a lipophilic bioactive substance).
Moreover, the stability during storage, pH and thermal stability , the encapsulation efficiency of vitamin B 12and vitamin E, and interfacial properties of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions prepared using the SPI-XG and SPI-CA complexes were compared. The digestive character- istics of these emulsions were further investigated.This study provides a new approach to prepare this novel co-delivery emulsion, which promotes the development of the emulsion.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Materials Soybean protein isolate, xanthan gum (CAS#11138-66-2), carrageenan (CAS#9000-07-1, intensity 1200), vitamin B 12, and vitamin E were purchased from Yuanye Biotechnol- ogy Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China).Soybean oil was purchased from a local market (Harbin, China).Distilled water was used, and all other chemicals used were of analytical grade.2.2.Preparation of SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W Emulsions 2.2.1.
Preparation of W 1/O Emulsions First, 0.2% ( w/v) vitamin B 12and 0.1 M NaCl were dissolved in distilled water to prepare the W 1. Then, 5% ( w/w) PGPR and 2.0% ( w/v) vitamin E were added to soybean oil to prepare the oil phase (O).W 1was added to O (10%, v/v), and they were mixed at 9000 rpm for 4 min using the high-speed shear disperser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) to prepare the W 1/O emulsion.2.2.2.Preparation of W 1/O/W 2Emulsions The W 2was prepared by mixing a certain concentration of the SPI solution with different concentrations (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% w/v) of the XG and CA solutions in a 3:1 ratio.The pH of the SPI, SPI-XG, and SPI-CA solutions was adjusted to 7.00.Next, W 1/O was added to W 2(40 wt%), and the mixture was homogenized by the same disperser at 8000 rpm for 4 min to prepare the emulsion.The emulsion prepared using the SPI alone served as the control group.Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 3 of 16 2.3.
Particle Size and Zeta Potential Measurements The measurements of the emulsion were conducted using Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). The emulsions were diluted.The measurement of the particle size was evaluated through dynamic light scattering.The refractive index of the dispersed phase W1/O was set to 1.50 and 1.33 for the continuous phase at room temperature and measured at a ﬁxed detection angle of 90◦[4].2.4.Emulsiﬁcation Properties The emulsification properties were evaluated using a similar approach of Aewsiri et al.[14].The measurement was conducted using the UV-2600 ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).First, the freshly prepared sample was mixed with the SDS solution, and the absorbance values (A 0) were measured at 500 nm.Then, the emulsion was left undisturbed for 30 min, and the absorbance values (A 30) were measured again.
The emulsifying activity index (EAI) and the emulsifying stability index (ESI) were calculated as follows: EAI =2×2.303A0N C×θ×10000(1) ESI=A0 A0−A30×30 (2) where A 0represents the absorbance values at 0 min (500 nm), A 30represents the absorbance values at 30 min (500 nm), N is the dilution factor (1000), C is the protein concentration of the W 2(g/mL), and θis the fraction of the oil phase. 2.5.Absorbed Protein Content The emulsion was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min.The supernatant was ﬁltered using a 0.22µm ﬁlter, and its protein content was determined [ 3].The absorbed protein content (AP) was calculated as follows: AP(%)=Ct−Cs Ct×100 (3) where C trepresents the protein concentration of the emulsion (g/mL), and C srepresents the protein concentration of the ﬁltrate (g/mL).2.6.Rheological Properties Apparent viscosity and frequency sweep of the freshly prepared sample were mea- sured using the RST-CPS rheometer (Brookﬁeld, MA, USA).
First, 2 mL of the freshly prepared sample was placed between two parallel plates at room temperature, and 1.0 mm gap was maintained between these two plates. Apparent viscosity was measured with a shear rate range of 0.1–100 s−1.Amplitude scanning was performed at 1 Hz to determine the linear viscoelastic region (LVR).Frequency scanning was performed at a constant stress of 1% (within LVR).Changes in the storage and loss moduli (G′and G′′, respectively) were recorded when the frequency was increased from 0.1 to 100 rad/s [15].2.7.Microstructure 2.7.1.Optical Microscope The freshly prepared sample was diluted with distilled water.Then, 15 µL of the diluted sample was placed on the center of the glass slide and covered with a cover glass.The diluted emulsion on the slide was observed under the BX53 optical microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.7.2.
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) can better analyze the differences in structures of the emulsions. The CLSM method was slightly modiﬁed according to Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 4 of 16 Choi et al.[16].The images were obtained using the Deltavision OMX SR super-resolution microscope (GE, Boston, MA, USA) in the ﬂuorescence mode.Nile red and Nile blue were dispersed in 10 mL isopropanol to prepare Nile red (1%, w/v) and Nile blue (0.1%, w/v) solutions, respectively.Then, the dye solutions were mixed with the emulsion in sequence and stored in the dark at room temperature for 40 min.The excitation wavelengths of CLSM were 510 and 561 nm for Nile blue and Nile red, respectively.2.8.Physicochemical Stability 2.8.1.Storage Stability First, 10 mL of the freshly prepared sample was added into 15 mL plastic centrifuge tubes, and the heights of the retained emulsion (H 1) during the storage period and initial emulsion (H 0) were recorded [ 17].
Changes in stability are reﬂected through the creaming index (CI). CI was calculated as follows: Creaming index =H1 H0×100% (4) 2.8.2.pH Stability The pH of the freshly prepared sample was adjusted to 2.0 and 10.0 using 2 M acidic or alkali solutions.Then, the emulsions were stored at room temperature for 3 h.The approach was the same as that of storage stability , which was used to measure the CI of the emulsion.2.8.3.Thermal Stability The sample was heated in 50◦C and 90◦C water baths for 30 min.The thermal stability of the sample was determined using the same approach as that of storage stability.2.9.Encapsulation Efﬁciency After the free vitamin E in the emulsion was removed with ethanol, the emulsion was centrifuged at 4000 ×gfor 30 min.Then, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 361 nm.The residue was added to the ethanol and n-hexane mixture (1:2, v/v), stirred and centrifuged at 7000 ×gfor 25 min.
Next, the absorbance of the obtained supernatant was measured at 286 nm. Vitamin E and vitamin B 12concentrations were determined using the standard curve.The encapsulation efﬁciencies (EE) of vitamin E and vitamin B 12were calculated as follows: EE(%)=C1 C2×100% (5) EE(%)=( 1−C3 C4) ×100% (6) where C 1represents the concentration of vitamin E of the supernatant (g/mL), C 2represents the concentration of vitamin E of the emulsion (g/mL), C 3represents the concentration of vitamin B 12of the supernatant (g/mL), and C 4represents the concentration of vitamin B 12 of the emulsion (g/mL).2.10.Antioxidant Activity 2.10.1.1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) Radical Scavenging Activity The approach of Huang et al.[ 18] was slightly modiﬁed to evaluate the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the emulsion.Next, 3 mL DPPH solution (0.25 mmol/L) was mixed with 0.3 mL of the sample, which was prepared with anhydrous ethanol.
The sample was stored in the dark for 40 min, and its absorbance was measured at 519 nm. The DPPH radical scavenging rate of the samples was calculated as per the following formula: DPPH radical scavenging rate (%)=(1−A1−A2 A3)×100% (7) Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 5 of 16 where A 1represents the absorbance of the emulsion, A 2represents the absorbance of the emulsion–ethanol solution, and A 3represents the absorbance of the DPPH–ethanol solution.2.10.2.2,2′-Azinobis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate acid] (ABTS) Radical Scavenging Activity The method of Yi et al.[ 19] was slightly modiﬁed to evaluate the ABTS radical scav- enging activity of the emulsion.Accordingly, the ABTS solution was mixed with an equal volume of potassium persulfate solution.Then, the mixture was stored in the dark at room temperature for 10–18 h to generate the ABTS+ radical.Next, the mixture was diluted with ethanol to produce an absorbance value of 0.70 ±0.02 at 735 nm.
This mixture was used as the working solution for ABTS. Then, 0.3 mL of the emulsion was mixed with 3 mL of the ABTS working solution and stored in darkness at room temperature for 40 min.The absorbance of the emulsion was measured at 735 nm.The ABTS radical scavenging rate of the samples was calculated as follows: ABTS radical scavenging rate (%)=(1−A4−A5 A6)×100% (8) where A 4represents the absorbance of the emulsion, A 5represents the absorbance of the emulsion–ethanol solution, and A 6represents the absorbance of the ABTS–ethanol solution.2.11.In Vitro Digestion Gastric digestion: First, 10 mL of the emulsion was mixed with 10 mL of simulated gastric ﬂuid (pepsin, HCl, and NaCl), and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 2.0.The mixture was incubated on a shaker for 2 h.Intestinal digestion: First, 10 mL of the gastric digest was mixed with 10 mL of the simulated intestinal ﬂuid (bile salt, trypsin, and lipase), and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7.0.
The mixture was incubated on a shaker for 2 h. During incubation, the pH of the mixture was maintained at 7.0 with NaOH, with the amount of NaOH solution consumed being recorded.2.11.1.Release of Free Fatty Acids The release of free fatty acids (FFAs) during digestion was calculated based on the consumption of the NaOH solution [ 20].The FFA release rate was calculated using the following formula: FFA (%)= (Moil×VNaOH×mNaOH 2×ωoil)×100% (9) where M oilis the molecular mass of oil (g/mol), V NaOH is the volume of NaOH solution consumed when neutralizing the released FFA (L), M NaOH is the concentration of NaOH solution (1 mol/L), and woilis the mass of oil in the W/O/W emulsion before digestion (g).2.11.2.Bioaccessibility First, 10 mL of the digested sample was centrifuged at 5000 r/min for 40 min.The absorbance of supernatant was measured at 361 nm.Then, 2 mL of the micelles obtained after centrifugation were mixed with 10 mL of the mixture of ethanol and n-hexane (2:1, v/v).
Next, the obtained mixture was centrifugated at 1700 ×gfor 10 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 285 nm.Bioaccessibility can be calculated as follows: Bioaccessibility (%)=C5 C6×100% (10) where C 5is the concentration of vitamin E/vitamin B 12(mg/g), and C 6is the total concen- tration of vitamin E/vitamin B 12(mg/g).Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 6 of 16 2.12.Statistical Analysis All experiments were performed three times, and each result was expressed as the mean±standard deviation.The statistical signiﬁcance of the results was determined using SPSS.The data were statistically compared using one-way analysis of variance and Duncan’s test.Differences were considered signiﬁcant at p< 0.05.3.Results and Discussion 3.1.Particle Size and Zeta Potential Figure 1A presents the particle sizes of SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions.Com- pared with that of the SPI emulsion, the particle sizes of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions increased with the addition of polysaccharides.
Although the particle sizes of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions decreased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) with the increased polysaccharide concentration, the particle sizes were not lower than that of the SPI emulsion. The added polysaccharides led to the thickening of the interfacial layer of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions and the aggregation and bridging ﬂocculation of W 1/O emulsion droplets, which resulted in their larger particle size.Furthermore, the particle size decreased with the increased polysaccharide concentration, indicating that the polysaccharides adsorbed at the interface prevented oil droplet aggregation, whereas they increased the electrostatic and steric repulsion [ 4].The SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with smaller droplets exhibited better stability.However, the particle size of the SPI-XG emulsion increased at 0.5% XG, possibly for two reasons.On the one hand, the high concentration of the SPI-XG complexes increased the droplet diameter.
On the other hand, the increased interaction between dispersed molecules adsorbed at the phase interface enhanced droplet interactions [21].

Furthermore, the EAI and ESI of the SPI‐XG W/O/W emulsion decreased at 0.5% XG. Excessive XG may also result in droplet flocculation, an increase in the specific surface area of the droplets, and the competition of the SPI at the phase interface to reduce the amount of SPI adsorbed at the phase interface, thereby decreasing EAI and ESI.The emulsification properties of the SPI‐ XG emulsion were greater than those of the SPI‐CA emulsion.XG had a higher viscosity than CA, which enhanced the continuous phase viscosity, thereby allowing a higher Figure 1.Cont .Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 7 of 16 Foods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 18 Figure 1.Particle size and zeta potential (A), emulsification properties (B), and absorbed protein content (C) of SPI‐XG and SPI‐CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the figures represent significant differences (p < 0.05).3.2.
Emulsification Properties Emulsification properties are crucial indicators of the stability of emulsion and its ability to stabilize the phase interface [9]. The EAI and ESI of the SPI‐XG and SPI‐CA emulsions increased with an increase in the polysaccharide concentration (Figure 1B).XG and CA contributed to the exposure of more hydrophobic groups of the SPI, improved protein aggregation, and made the SPI generate steric hindrance at the phase interface, which increased the emulsification properties of the emulsions.Furthermore, the EAI and ESI of the SPI‐XG W/O/W emulsion decreased at 0.5% XG.Excessive XG may also result in droplet flocculation, an increase in the specific surface area of the droplets, and the competition of the SPI at the phase interface to reduce the amount of SPI adsorbed at the phase interface, thereby decreasing EAI and ESI.The emulsification properties of the SPI‐ XG emulsion were greater than those of the SPI‐CA emulsion.
XG had a higher viscosity than CA, which enhanced the continuous phase viscosity, thereby allowing a higher Figure 1. Particle size and zeta potential ( A), emulsiﬁcation properties ( B), and absorbed protein content ( C) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the ﬁgures represent signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05).Figure 1A also displays that the absolute zeta potential values of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions increased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) after XG and CA were added.The bond between anionic polysaccharides and the cationic side of proteins resulted in the formation of anionic aggregates, thereby forming soluble complexes [ 22].The anionic aggregates formed not only made the emulsion droplets negatively charged but also increased the absolute value.
Moreover, the adhesion between the SPI-XG complexes attached to the droplet surface caused the bridging flocculation of the emulsion droplets, thereby decreasing the absolute value of the SPI-XG emulsion. Furthermore, because of the large charge density of CA, when the CA concentration increased, a similar increase observed in the CA amount led to a continued increase in the absolute value of the SPI-CA emulsion.3.2.Emulsiﬁcation Properties Emulsiﬁcation properties are crucial indicators of the stability of emulsion and its ability to stabilize the phase interface [ 9].The EAI and ESI of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions increased with an increase in the polysaccharide concentration (Figure 1B).XG and CA contributed to the exposure of more hydrophobic groups of the SPI, improved protein aggregation, and made the SPI generate steric hindrance at the phase interface, which increased the emulsiﬁcation properties of the emulsions.
Furthermore, the EAI and ESI of the SPI-XG W/O/W emulsion decreased at 0.5% XG. Excessive XG may also result in droplet ﬂocculation, an increase in the speciﬁc surface area of the droplets, and the competition of the SPI at the phase interface to reduce the amount of SPI adsorbed at the phase interface, thereby decreasing EAI and ESI.The emulsification properties of the SPI-XG emulsion were greater than those of the SPI-CA emulsion.XG had a higher viscosity than CA, which enhanced the continuous phase viscosity , thereby allowing a higher absorption of the SPI at the phase interface and resulting in better emulsification properties.3.3.Absorbed Protein Content The AP of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions is presented in Figure 1C.Com- pared with the SPI emulsion, the addition of XG and CA signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) increased AP , possibly due to the adsorption of more soybean proteins at the phase interface [ 23].
As the polysaccharide concentration reached 0.5%, AP slightly decreased or increased. This may be caused by the competition between polysaccharides and proteins at the phase interface.Furthermore, the increase in the speciﬁc surface area of the droplets reduced the amount of protein adsorbed at the interface.The SPI-XG W/O/W emulsion had a higher AP , indicating that XG can lead to a higher protein adsorption at the phase interface, thus leading to the formation of the denser ﬁlm at the interface.The results of AP were consistent with those of Section 3.2.Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 8 of 16 3.4.Rheological Properties Figure 2A presents the change in the apparent viscosity of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions.The viscosity of the emulsions decreased with the increase in their shear rate.All emulsions exhibited a trend of shear thinning, indicating that all emulsions were pseudoplastic ﬂuids.
This may be attributable to the reversible structure formation at some states; thus, the shearing of the material led to structural damage, thereby resulting in a shear-dependent behavior [ 24]. Furthermore, the viscosity of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions continuously increased as the XG and CA concentrations increased.The SPI-XG and SPI-CA complexes had higher viscoelasticity, increased viscosity of the continuous phase, enhanced interaction between the droplets, and increased apparent viscosity of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions.In addition, the viscosity of the SPI-XG emulsion was greater than that of SPI-CA, which may be due to the viscosity of the SPI-XG complexes being higher than that of the SPI-CA complexes.Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 18 Figure 2.Apparent viscosity ( A) and frequency sweep ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.3.5.
Microstructure The optical microscopic images and the CL SM images of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions are presented in Figure 3A,B . The emulsion droplets are spherical, the W1 is tightly surrounded by the O, and the W 1/O emulsion droplets inside these droplets are clearly visible.Meanwhile, the size of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsion droplets were distinct at different polysaccharide concentr ations.The size of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsion droplets first increased and then decreased with polysaccharide addition.Compared with the SPI emulsion, the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsion droplets were more uniformly dispersed and exhibited almost no aggregation.This may be because the added polysaccharides increased the repulsive forces between droplets and prevented droplet aggregation.However, at a polysaccharide concentration of 0.5%, the size of the SPI-XG emulsion droplets was larger, and the distribu tion of the SPI-CA emulsion droplets was non-uniform.
Excessive polysaccharides could increase the viscosity of the continuous phase of the SPI-XG emulsion, thereby making them more prone to aggregation. The results of microstructure are consistent with those provided in Section 3.1.Figure 2.Apparent viscosity ( A) and frequency sweep ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Figure 2B presents the increase in the storage and loss moduli (G′and G′′, respectively) of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions with the increase in frequency.Furthermore, the values of both G′and G′′were low and indicate a signiﬁcant dependence on frequency.The result showed an initial frequency sweep in which G′′was greater than G′until their intersection was above the speciﬁc frequency.This may be attributable to the higher concentration of dispersed phase and the adsorbed biopolymer layers of neighboring droplets with stronger interactions [ 25].
Beyond this intersection, G′was higher than G′′, which indicated that all emulsions ﬁnally exhibited an elastic behavior. In addition, both G′ and G′′of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions were greater than those of the SPI emulsion, Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 9 of 16 which was attributable to the fact that the added XG and CA enhanced the interaction between the droplets of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions, thereby achieving a more stable network structure [ 26].The SPI-CA W/O/W emulsion had a higher modulus and better elastic properties than the SPI-XG W/O/W emulsion.3.5.Microstructure The optical microscopic images and the CLSM images of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions are presented in Figure 3A,B.The emulsion droplets are spherical, the W 1is tightly surrounded by the O, and the W 1/O emulsion droplets inside these droplets are clearly visible.Meanwhile, the size of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsion droplets were distinct at different polysaccharide concentrations.
The size of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsion droplets ﬁrst increased and then decreased with polysaccharide addition. Compared with the SPI emulsion, the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsion droplets were more uniformly dispersed and exhibited almost no aggregation.This may be because the added polysaccharides increased the repulsive forces between droplets and prevented droplet aggregation.However, at a polysaccharide concentration of 0.5%, the size of the SPI-XG emulsion droplets was larger, and the distribution of the SPI-CA emulsion droplets was non-uniform.Excessive polysaccharides could increase the viscosity of the continuous phase of the SPI-XG emulsion, thereby making them more prone to aggregation.The results of microstructure are consistent with those provided in Section 3.1.Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 18 Figure 3.Cont .Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 10 of 16 Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 18 Figure 3.

Green repres ents the SPI, and red represents the oil phase.Yellow represents the composition of the SPI and oil phase.3.6.Physicochemical Stability 3.6.1.Storage Stability Figure 4A presents the storage capacity of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions.CI represents changes in stability.After the po lysaccharides were added, the CI of the SPI- XG and SPI-CA emulsions significantly ( p < 0.05) increased compared with that of the SPI during the storage period.Although the CI of the emulsion significantly ( p < 0.05) decreased in the first 14 days, and it slowly decreased in the latter 14 days.
This was attributable to the higher viscosity ex hibited by the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions, which promoted the formation of a more viscous structure of the two types of emulsions and slowed down the movement of W 1/O droplets, thereby resulting in a more stable emulsion structure [27]. As the polysaccharide concentration increased, the CI of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions did not decrea se as much as that of the SPI emulsion Figure 3.Optical microscopy ( A) and confocal laser scanning microscopy ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Green represents the SPI, and red represents the oil phase.Yellow represents the composition of the SPI and oil phase.3.6.Physicochemical Stability 3.6.1.Storage Stability Figure 4A presents the storage capacity of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions.CI represents changes in stability.

Although the CI of the emulsion signiﬁcantly (p< 0.05) decreased in the ﬁrst 14 days, and it slowly decreased in the latter 14 days.This was attributable to the higher viscosity exhibited by the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions, which promoted the formation of a more viscous structure of the two types of emulsions and slowed down the movement of W 1/O droplets, thereby resulting in a more stable emulsion structure [ 27].As the polysaccharide concentration increased, the CI of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions did not decrease as much as that of the SPI emulsion during storage.Meanwhile, excessive polysaccharides significantly ( p< 0.05) decreased the CI during storage.Therefore, the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions were more stable than the SPI emulsion.

Meanwhile, excessive polysaccharides significantly ( p < 0.05) decreased the CI during storage.Therefore, the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions were more stable than the SPI emulsion.Figure 4.Storage stability at 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d ( A), stability at pH 2 and 10 ( B), stability at 50 °C and 90 °C ( C) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the figures re present significant differences ( p < 0.05).3.6.2.pH Stability.Figure 4.Storage stability at 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d ( A), stability at pH 2 and 10 ( B), stability at 50◦C and 90◦C (C) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the ﬁgures represent signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05).3.6.2.pH Stability Figure 4B presents the pH stability of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions.
The CI of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions was higher than that of the SPI emulsion at pH 2 and 10. However, the CI decreased substantially at pH 2 because under this condition, the pH value of SPI was below its isoelectric point (IEP), and most of the SPI was protonated.Furthermore, the SPI-XG and SPI-CA complexes were formed through electrostatic interactions.Therefore, at pH 2, the complexes precipitated out of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions based on strong charge interactions, thereby limiting their molecular absorption at the droplet interface [ 28].At pH 10, the emulsions were highly stable because of the stronger electrostatic repulsion within the SPI.The pH value of the SPI was considerably higher than its IEP , which thus lead to the inhibition of the SPI flocculation.Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 12 of 16 3.6.3.Thermal Stability Figure 4C displays the thermal stability of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions.
First, the trend is broadly the same as that observed in Sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2. At 50◦C and 90◦C, the CI of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions was greater than 50%.Although the emulsion was thermodynamically unstable, the added XG and CA signiﬁcantly (p< 0.05) improved their thermal stability.The thermal stability of the SPI-XG emulsion was greater than that of the SPI-CA emulsion.On the one hand, the higher temperature may have accelerated the motion between the droplets, such that the adsorption ability of these droplets at the interface weakened, making the emulsion unstable.On the other hand, the structure formed by the SPI and CA was not as strong as that formed by the SPI and XG.The degree of structural destruction of the SPI-CA emulsion by higher temperatures was greater than that of the SPI-XG emulsion [29].3.7.
Encapsulation Efﬁciency Figure 5A presents the effect of different polysaccharide concentrations on the encap- sulation efﬁciencies of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions. The encapsulation efﬁciencies of the emulsions for vitamin B 12and vitamin E increased from 81.17% and 77.03% (SPI) to 86.72% (XG 0.4%) and 86.47% (CA 0.5%) and 86.31% (XG 0.4%) and 85.78% (CA 0.5%), respectively.The SPI emulsion had the lowest encapsulation efﬁciency.Further- more, the encapsulation efﬁciency of the emulsions was highest when the XG concentration was 0.4% and the CA concentration was 0.5%.The added polysaccharides increased the viscosity of the continuous phase, thereby resulting in a more robust SPI-XG and SPI-CA coating around the W 1/O droplets [ 30].The coating inhibited vitamin B 12and vitamin E re- lease and prevented the migration of internal substances, leading to a higher encapsulation efﬁciency of the whole system [ 31].
Moreover, a certain decrease in the encapsulation efﬁ- ciency was observed with an increase in the polysaccharide concentration. At a possibly too high polysaccharide concentration, the complexes caused the ﬂocculation or aggregation of the emulsion droplets, thereby decreasing the stability of the SPI-XG emulsion.Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 18 Figure 5.Encapsulation efficiency ( A) and antioxidant activity ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Differe nt letters in the figures represent significant differences ( p < 0.05).3.8.Antioxidant Activity.The antioxidant activities of the SPI- XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions can be evaluated by measuring their capacity to scavenge ABTS and DPPH free radicals.The antioxidant activity of the emulsions for DPPH and ABTS increased from 45.76% and 46.39% (SPI) to 53.73% (XG 0.5%) and 55.47% (CA 0.5%) and 61.28% (XG 0.5%) and 64.78% (CA 0.5%), respectively.
The SPI emulsion had the lowest antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activities of the emulsions were highest when the XG and the CA concentrations were 0.5%.The added XG and CA significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced the number of free radicals (Figure 5B).Thus, the antioxidant activity of the SPI-XG/CA emulsion was enhanced.The SPI-XG and SPI- CA emulsions had a continuous phase with higher viscosity than the SPI emulsion.Thus , a denser film was formed at the phase interface and the contact area of their carb oxyl and amino groups with free radicals increased.Additionally, the two-membrane and three-phase complex structure of the emulsion also reduced the loss of antioxidan t substances and improved the antioxidant activity of the emulsion.3.9.In Vitro Digestion All W/O/W emulsions exhibited a rapid increa se in the FFA release rate during the first 60 min (Figure 6A).However, after this time, the rate began to slow down and then exhibited a gradual slow increase.
Du ring digestion, the SPI in the W 2 of the droplets was rapidly replaced by bile sa lts and phospholipids, which promoted lipase attachment, caused the rapid attachment of lipase mole cules at the surface of the oil phase, and facilitated droplet digestion [32]. The SPI emul sion had the highest FFA release rate, which indicated that it does not prevent droplet di gestion sufficiently.In contrast, SPI-XG and SPI-CA complexes in the W 2 increased the viscosity of the continuous phase of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions and increased the thickness of the SPI film at the phase interface.Figure 5.Encapsulation efﬁciency ( A) and antioxidant activity ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the ﬁgures represent signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05).Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 13 of 16 3.8.
Antioxidant Activity The antioxidant activities of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions can be evalu- ated by measuring their capacity to scavenge ABTS and DPPH free radicals. The antioxidant activity of the emulsions for DPPH and ABTS increased from 45.76% and 46.39% (SPI) to 53.73% (XG 0.5%) and 55.47% (CA 0.5%) and 61.28% (XG 0.5%) and 64.78% (CA 0.5%), re- spectively.The SPI emulsion had the lowest antioxidant activity.The antioxidant activities of the emulsions were highest when the XG and the CA concentrations were 0.5%.The added XG and CA signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) reduced the number of free radicals (Figure 5B).Thus, the antioxidant activity of the SPI-XG/CA emulsion was enhanced.The SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions had a continuous phase with higher viscosity than the SPI emulsion.Thus, a denser ﬁlm was formed at the phase interface and the contact area of their carboxyl and amino groups with free radicals increased.
Additionally, the two-membrane and three- phase complex structure of the emulsion also reduced the loss of antioxidant substances and improved the antioxidant activity of the emulsion. 3.9.In Vitro Digestion All W/O/W emulsions exhibited a rapid increase in the FFA release rate during the ﬁrst 60 min (Figure 6A).However, after this time, the rate began to slow down and then exhibited a gradual slow increase.During digestion, the SPI in the W 2of the droplets was rapidly replaced by bile salts and phospholipids, which promoted lipase attachment, caused the rapid attachment of lipase molecules at the surface of the oil phase, and facilitated droplet digestion [ 32].The SPI emulsion had the highest FFA release rate, which indicated that it does not prevent droplet digestion sufﬁciently.In contrast, SPI-XG and SPI-CA complexes in the W 2increased the viscosity of the continuous phase of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions and increased the thickness of the SPI film at the phase interface.
This inhibited lipid digestion and decreased the FFA release rate. The SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions produced fewer FFAs, which was attributable to the ability of the complexes to resist displacement of bile salts, phospholipids, and lipases from the oil phase surface.Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 18 This inhibited lipid digestion and decreased the FFA release rate.The SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions produced fewer FFAs, which was attributable to the ability of the complexes to resist displacement of bile sa lts, phospholipids, and lipases from the oil phase surface.The bioaccessibilities of SPI-XG an d SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions increased significantly ( p < 0.05) as XG and CA concentrations increased (Figure 6B).The bioaccessibilities of the emulsions for vitamin B 12 and vitamin E increased from 55.98% and 64.10% (SPI) to 73.53% (XG 0.4%) and 71.32% (CA 0.5%) and to 68.86% (XG 0.4%) and 68.74% (CA 0.5%), respectively.SPI emulsion had the lowest bioaccessibility.
The bioaccessibilities of the emulsions were highes t when the XG concentration was 0.4% and the CA concentration was 0.5%. This indica ted that the added XG and CA effectively protected vitamin B 12 and vitamin E.Bioaccessibility is the percentage of embedded vitamin B 12 and vitamin E transferred to the mixed micelles during digestion, so that they can be absorbed in the intestine [33].The bioaccessibility of the W/OW emulsion was dependent on changes in the FFA release rate.XG and CA retarded the breakdown of the emulsion and slowed down lipid digestion [34].This resulted in higher bioavailability as more vitamin B 12 and vitamin E could be retained in the micelles.Figure 6.Release of free fatty acids ( A) and bioavailability ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the figures represent significant differences ( p < 0.05).4.Conclusions This study successfully prepared SPI-XG and SPI-CA co-delivery W/O/W emulsions.
The particle sizes of the SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions decreased, and their zeta absolute potential values increased as XG and CA conc entrations increased. The added XG and CA improved the SPI aggregation and increased th e electrostatic repulsion, and thus, more SPI was adsorbed at the phase interface, and a denser film was formed at the interface.The emulsifying activity index and emulsify ing stability index increased to 24.09 (XG 0.4%) and 14.00 (CA 0.5%) and to 151.08 (XG 0.4%) and 135.34 (CA 0.5%), respectively.The adsorbed protein content increased to 88.90% (XG 0.4%) and 88.23% (CA 0.5%), Figure 6.Release of free fatty acids ( A) and bioavailability ( B) of SPI-XG and SPI-CA emulsions with different polysaccharide concentrations.Different letters in the ﬁgures represent signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05).Foods 2023 ,12, 4361 14 of 16 The bioaccessibilities of SPI-XG and SPI-CA W/O/W emulsions increased signiﬁcantly (p< 0.05) as XG and CA concentrations increased (Figure 6B).

The encapsulation efﬁciencies of vitamin B 12and vitamin E were increased to 86.72% (XG 0.4%) and 86.47 (CA 0.5%) and 86.31% (XG 0.4%) and 85.78% (CA 0.5%), respectively.
