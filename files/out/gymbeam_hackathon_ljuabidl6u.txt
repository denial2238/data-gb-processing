Five hundred and fourty ‐five males, who tested positive for anabolic steroids in Danish fitness centers during the period January 3, 2006 to March 1, 2018, were matched with 5450randomly chosen male controls. Data was cross ‐referenced with seven national registers pertaining to information about education, employment status, and psychiatric comorbidity.Main outcomes and measures were prescription of psychopharmacological treatment.Results: The incidence of treatment with anxiolytics (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.62 −3.38) and antipsychotics (HR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.99 −3.63) displayed a remarkable increase in the years following doping sanction, compared to the control group.The prevalenceof antidepressant use was already markedly elevated several years before doping sanction, but also displayed a higher incidence in the years following sanction (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.28 −2.13).The associations remained highly significant after controlling for socioeconomic factors.
Conclusion: Anabolic steroids use is strongly associated with psychiatric morbidity. KEYWORDS androgenic anabolic steroids, depression, depressive adverse reactions, neuropsychiatric effects 1|INTRODUCTION The prevalence of anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use amongst young men is reported as high as 6% (Sagoe et al., 2014 ).Physical strength is usually perceived as markers of masculinity, health, andhigh genetic quality, (Sell et al., 2017 ) thus allegedly creating an incentive to use AAS.Furthermore, users of AAS have been found to have a high degree of a dysmorphic body image before initiating theuse of AAS (Smit et al., 2021 ).It is well known that AAS causes somatic adverse effects such as hypogonadism, gynecomastia, acne, and infertility (Horwitz, Andersen & Dalhoff, 2019 ).Furthermore, an additional number of psychiatric adverse effects such as aggressive ness, depression, and mania has been reported (Amaral et al., 2022 ;P o p ee ta l ., 2014 ).
A recent study by Nackeeran et al. ( 2022 ) has shown that testosterone use is associated with a higher risk of major depressive disorders and suicide attempt.AAS affects the hypothalamic ‐pituitary ‐gonadal axis and, conse- quently, exogen administration of AAS decreases the endogenous Depression and Anxiety .2022;39:805 –812.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/da |805 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any me dium, provided the original work is properly cited.© 2022 The Authors.Depression and Anxiety published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.production of follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone (Rahnema et al., 2014 ).
Recent publications suggest another link between testosterone and mental health; first, testos- terone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men has been seen to improve psychological well ‐being; second, androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer is associated with depression (Fischer et al., 2019 ; Hartgens & Kuipers, 2004 ; McHenry et al., 2014 ; Nead, 2019 ; Walther et al., 2019 ). Third, a recent study conducted by Rasmussen et al.( 2016 ) found that former AAS users exhibited significantly lower plasma testosterone levels and also exhibited a higher proportion of depressive symptoms (no correlation test reported).AAS is suspected to induce alterations in central nervous system structure and function which has been explored in several studies.Long ‐term use of AAS was found to be associated with amygdala enlargement and poorer visual spatial function in AAS using male weightlifters compared to weightlifters with no experience with AAS (Kaufman et al., 2015 ).
With a similar design, Bjørnebekk et al. ( 2017 ) found that AAS users had a thinner cortex in various regions as well as reduced total gray matter, cerebral cortex, and putamen.Altogether, this suggests that chronic use of AAS is associated with detrimental mental health effects, and the current study aims touncover the neuropsychiatric adverse effects associated with AAS.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 |Research endpoints 1.To compare the incidence and prevalence of psycho- pharmacological treatment in AAS users with that of a cohort ofage and gender matched controls.2.To compare the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in AAS users with that of a cohort of age and gender matched controls.2.2 |Design Retrospectively matched cohort study.
2.3 |The anti ‐doping program As previously described (Christoffersen et al., 2019 ; Horwitz, Andersen & Dalhoff, 2019 ; Windfeld ‐Mathiasen et al., 2021 ), it has long been a political ambition to create a safe and clean fitness environment in Denmark free of illegal doping. In Denmark 342 fitness centers collaborated with Anti Doping Denmark herebycovering 80% of all fitness center members.Anti Doping Denmark conducted around 1000 inspections of these centers annually and tested random athletes in the participating centers for use of illegaldoping drugs.In the first 2 years doping controls were conducted on a broader range of fitness members, however, this testing strategywas not cost effective and based on the experiences the testing was afterwards targeted subjects with an AAS abuser phenotype.Thus,the doping controls have primarily been targeted at persons visually suspected of AAS use, in other words muscular men and women who engage in weightlifting.
The time from test to sanction wasapproximately 3 to 4 weeks. Subjects were tested against a specific doping list developed and maintained by the Danish Medicines Agency, and the analysis were performed by a World Anti ‐Doping Agency certified laboratory.In less than 1% of the cases, subjects tested positive for testosterone alone.In all other cases, subjects test positive for exogenous anabolic steroids, which are not approved by theDanish Medicines Agency.In those rare cases where subjects test positive for testosterone alone, and hence could be the result of treatment by a physician, the subject were allowed to submitdocumentation for the treatme nt and, consequently, has been excluded from the cohort.For a description of the sanctioned subjects pretest morbidity please see (Horwitz, Andersen &Dalhoff, 2019 ).
A positive test or refusal to participate in the doping test resulted in a doping sanction which meant exclusion from all fitness centers in collaboration with Anti Doping Denmarkfor 2 years, and exclusion from all organized sports for 4 years. Thesanctioned individual was registe red in a national doping register, thus ensuring that only people with a clean profile could get access to fitness centers as well as sports clubs.2.4 |Cohorts From January 3, 2006 to March 1, 2018, 545 men were sanctioned due to AAS traces in the urine sample provided, and 644 men weresanctioned following their refusal to deliver a urine sample.Theprimary analyses are based solely on data from the 545 laboratory ‐ confirmed AAS users (AAS ‐user cohort), while the data from the cohort without urine samples is used as a replication cohort and canbe found in Supporting Information data.
For each AAS user, we randomly chose 10 controls from the general population, matched by age and gender from the same birth cohort living in Denmark at thetime (control cohort). 2.5 |Registries All residents in Denmark have a specific social identification number (CPR) used in all interactions with the state and the healthcaresystem.In this paper, we cross ‐referenced the patients' CPR numbers from AAS users with data from the Danish Civil Registration System, The DREAM database, The Danish National Registry of Patients, TheNational Hospital Register, the Danish Education Registers, The Danish National Prescription Register, and the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry as performed in our former researchpapers (Christoffersen et al., 2019 ; Horwitz, Andersen & Dalhoff, 2019 ; Windfeld ‐Mathiasen et al., 2021 ).A detailed description of the806 |WINDFELD ‐MATHIASEN ET AL.registers can be found in Supporting Information data.Patients were followed until May 16, 2018.
2.6 |Methods We generated a retrospectively matched cohort data set and analyzed it using several methods. The 545 males who testedpositive for AAS in Danish fitness centers during the period January3, 2006 to March 1, 2018, were matched with 5450 male controls.We cross ‐referenced their personal identification numbers with seven Danish national registries related to health information.Wefollowed this cohort from 10 years before baseline and until the end of follow ‐up in May 2018.We defined chronic use of medication as five or more redeemed prescriptions.2.7 |Statistics Data was tested using the t‐test for approximately normally distributed continuous variables, and χ2test for categorical variables.The cohorts were followed from 10 years before baseline and until the end of follow ‐up in May 16, 2018.In our calculation of observation time, we accounted for migration in and out of Denmark.All statistics were computed in SAS 9.4.
In our statistical analysis, we used Poisson regression, Cox proportional hazards regression, and logistic regression models. The Poisson regression model and Cox proportional hazards regressionwere used in relation to the length of follow ‐up, primarily to investigate the incidence rates.Pertaining to the prevalence of chronic outcomes we used the logistic regression model.Our datawas already matched on age and gender, and we furthermoreadjusted for potential confounders known at baseline; country of origin, employment status, and education (see Table 1).As sensitivity analysis we performed a self ‐controlled observa- tional design as we assumed that individuals who were just about to test positive for AAS use and individuals who had just been tested positive, did not differ substantially except through the effect of thedoping sanction and possible abstinence from AAS.
We therefore restrict the sample to a narrow time window consisting of the 2 years leading up to the positive test and the 2 years that followed. 3|RESULTS 3.1 |Baseline characteristics We followed 545 male AAS users and 5450 age and gender matched controls, from 10 years before doping sanction/baseline and until May 16, 2018.The average age at the time of doping sanction was 26.2 (standard deviation [SD] 6.3) years, and the average length offollow ‐up was 17.0 (SD 3.9) years in the AAS and 16.6 (SD 4.1) years in the control group ( p= .031).The AAS ‐group differs significantly statistically from the control group pertaining to educational and occupational status ( p< .0001).Thus, the control group generally tended to have longer education and a higher degree of employment (see Table 1).
3.2 |Comparison with the background population Table 2shows the cumulative prevalence of psychopharmacological treatment at baseline and final follow ‐up and psychopharmacological treatment is markedly increased in users of AAS. The incidence ofpsychopharmacological treatment is significantly higher in all four medication groups; antipsychotics (HR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.99 −3.63), anxiolytics (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.62 −3.38), antidepressants (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.28 −2.13), and psychostimulants (HR: 2.29 95% CI: 1.47−3.57).Furthermore, the incidence of treatment with anxiolytics and antipsychotics is seen to remarkably increase in the years following doping sanction, whereas the incidence of antidepressantsuse is already markedly elevated several years before doping sanction.Finally, the use of psychostimulants (medication against attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) seems to top 2 years afterdoping sanction (Figure 1).
Table 3summarizes the prevalence of chronic psychopharmacological treatment and psychiatric diagnoses.TABLE 1 Baseline characteristics AAS users Control pValue Age (years) Mean (SD) 26.2 (6.3) 26.2 (6.3) Education groups 2.2 5.1 <.0001a Missing % 10 years or less % 48.8 35.5 10−12 years % 9.9 22.0 12−15 years % 36.5 24.6 15 years or more % 2.6 12.8 Country of origin .22 Danish % 85.5 84.3 Immigrants % 10.6 12.7 Descendants of immigrants% 3.9 3.0 Occupational status <.0001a Missing % 1.7 1.1 Self‐supporting % 78.9 85.9 Sick leave — temporarily% 2.4 1.7 Disability benefits % 2.2 2.3 Unemployed % 14.9 9.1 Complete data % 96.5 94.6 .06 Abbreviations: AAS, anabolic androgenic steroid; SD, standard deviation. aSignificant pvalue obtained from ordinary χ2table test.WINDFELD ‐MATHIASEN ET AL.|807 Chronic psychopharmacological treatment is significantly more common among AAS users with regard to anxiolytics and anti-psychotics.
However, the association with antidepressants is only statistically significant in an unadjusted model. More formal psychiatric diagnoses, especially the prevalence of “Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use,”appear to be strongly associated with AAS use.There was not a higher prevalence of schizophrenia among the AAS ‐users as compared to controls.3.3 |Self ‐controlled observational design Finally, we analyzed the incidence of psychopharmacological treat- ment 2 years before doping with that of 2 years following dopingsanction.We hereby found that the incidence of antipsychotic and anxiolytic treatment was significantly higher in the period following doping sanction.Thus, the risk of initiating antipsychotic treatmentwas 2.36 times higher (RR: 2.36, 95% CI: [1.12 −4.99], p= .024) and the risk of initiating anxiolytic treatment was 2.97 times higher (RR: 2.97, 95% CI: [1.07 −8.24], p= .037) than in the 2 years period before doping sanction.
The incidence of psychostimulant treatment (RR = 2.10, 95% CI: [0.52 −8.36], p= .30) and treatment with antidepressants (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: [0.61 −2.13], p= .30) showed a nonsignificant trend (see Figure 1). 3.4 |Replication cohort Data on the replication cohort is found in the Supporting Informa- tion material.Overall, the data corroborates our findings thatalthough the use of psychopharmacological treatment was signifi- cantly higher among doping sanctioned compared to controls even years before doping sanction, and they generally displayed a higherdegree of psychiatric morbidity (Supporting Information: Tables S2 andS3).4|DISCUSSION In this retrospective study, we analyzed the association between use of AAS and psychopharmacological treatment and psychiatric diagnoses.
We found a significant association between AAS anduse of antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and psychostimu-lants, but surprisingly we did not find an increased hospitalization due to psychiatric disorders (including diagnoses of mood disorders). Probably indicating that most of these psychiatric side effects arerelatively mild.
In this context, it is worth noting that disorders exclusively treated in General Practice in Denmark, that is, outside the hospital system, are not available for research purposes.Therefore, we used medical treatment as a proxy for psychiatric disorders.TABLE 2 Incidence of psychopharmacological treatment Baseline Total AAS users (%) Control (%) AAS users Control HR pValue HR adjusted pValue At least one prescription of antipsychotics 5.9 3.5 15.6 7.3 2.69 (1.99 −3.63) <.0001a2.22 (1.63 −3.03) <.0001a At least one prescription of anxiolytics 5.1 3.6 11.6 6.4 2.34 (1.62 −3.38) <.0001a2.27 (1.56 −3.31) <.0001a At least one prescription of antidepressants 13.8 8.3 26.2 16.3 1.65 (1.28 −2.13) .0001a1.44 (1.11 −1.87) .006a At least one prescription of psychostimulants 2.4 2.0 6.8 3.9 2.29 (1.47 −3.57) .0002a1.86 (1.19 −2.93) .007a Note : Baseline: The cumulative prevalence at baseline, total: The cumulative prevalence for the entire period of investigation (baseline plus follow ‐up).
Abbreviation: AAS, anabolic androgenic steroid. aSignificant pvalue.Data were analyzed with time to event analysis (a Cox proportional hazard regression model).808 |WINDFELD ‐MATHIASEN ET AL.Several other clinical and observational studies underline the associations between AAS use and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Havnes et al., 2019 ; Horwitz & Christoffersen, 2019 ; Perry et al., 2003 ; Pope et al., 2000 ; Thiblin & Pärlklo, 2002 ).Already in the late 1980's, Pope and Katz ( 1988 ) conducted a smaller interview ‐based study in 41 athletes who had previously used AAS.In this study, nine subjects (22%) met the diagnostic criteria fora manic or depressive episode during/or after withdrawal from AASuse while five subjects (12%) had experienced psychotics symptoms.Later, Su et al.( 1993 ) investigated the acute neuropsychiatric effects of AAS in a placebo ‐controlled study including 20 healthy male volunteers in sequential 3 days trials of high ‐and low dose testosterone, respectively.
They found that high doses of AAS increased self ‐confidence, forgetfulness, distractibility, mood swings, and violent feelings. Recently, Havnes et al.also found that 78% of 232 AAS users reported physical and mental problems, whereas13.4% experienced physical adverse effects alone.The most common physical adverse effects were anxiety, behavioral change, and depression (Havnes et al., 2019 ).Smit et al.followed 100 male volunteers in the Haarlem ‐study, and assessed their mental well ‐being before, during and after an AAS cycle using psychological questionnaires.They found a prevalence of mild to moderate depression before a cycle of 10%, and this figuredid not vary significantly throughout the total cycle (Smit et al., 2021 ).Our data displayed interesting temporal trends regarding initia- tion of anxiolytic and antipsychotic treatment in the years following doping sanction.
In contrast, the incidence of antidepressivetreatment was markedly elevated throughout the entire period of investigation. Hence can these findings be seen as a consequence of AAS use, hypogonadism, or a matter of confounding?AAS have a profound impact on the hypothalamic ‐pituitary ‐ testicular axis, and recovery after cessation of AAS use has been FIGURE 1 The incidence of psychopharmacological treatment illustrated with incidence rates over time.NS, non significant p> .05, *significant p= .01−.05, *** p< .001.Data were analyzed with a Poisson regression model.WINDFELD ‐MATHIASEN ET AL.|809 reported to have a duration of 3 −18 months and may only be partial (Botman et al., 2022 ;H a n d e l s m a n , 2021 ; Smit et al., 2021 ).Thus, the high incidence of treatment with anxiolytics and antipsychotics in the year following doping sanction is plausible to compensate for the deprived amount of testosterone.
Low levels oftestosterone is known to have an adverse impact on mental health and treatment with testosterone is known to alleviate depression in men (Walther et al., 2019 ). Studies on animals have shown that anxiety and aggression are elevated after chronic exposure to AAS.These effects are to some extent explained through a complex interaction in the neuronalnetwork which are believed to generate anxiety and aggression.Studies have demonstrated alterations of classical neurotransmitters, such as GABA in relation to anxiety, and neuromodulatory peptides,such as arginine vasopressin and substance P in relation to aggression(Oberlander & Henderson, 2012 ).Altogether, evidence supports that AAS have detrimental mental health effects, the mechanism might be mediated boththrough low levels of testosterone in the abstinence period and through direct neuromodulatory effects.
We found a high incidence of psychopharmacological treatment in the yearsfollowing doping sanction, and this may indicate that withdrawalof AAS and possibly rather immediate onset of altered androgen hormonal status is associated with psychological adverse effects. However, the current study is not with out limitation.First, this study builds on the hypothesis that psychopharmacological treatment is a proxy of psychiatric illness.Second, the doping sanction in itself mightprecipitate psychiatric adverse effects and the isolated effect of sanction and the potential stigma associated with this or lack of exercise may also have adverse mental health effects.Third, it is well ‐known that users of AAS have a hazardous lifestyle and illicit drug abuse is common (Christoffersen et al., 2019 ;S a g o ee ta l ., 2015 ).Fourth, we believe our results are associated with a high internal validity.
However, our studywas only performed in Denmark and this may potentially influence the external validity. Fifth, testing was not done randomly, and some AAS users may not have the bodybuilder physique and hence not been atarget for doping control.Finally, the amount and duration of theexposure are missing, and it should be noted, that the extent of which a positive test led to a cessation or a reduction in androgen use cannot be verified.A large fraction of these men probably continued to useandrogens.In contrast, the major strength of this study is the relatively large sample size, and the nationwide high ‐quality registries, which allows us to follow an individual continuousl y over time.
Additionally, it seems unlikely that a person with severe depression will administer AAS andTABLE 3 Chronic psychopharmacological treatment and diagnoses AAS (%) Control (%) OR (unadjusted) pValue OR (adjusted) pValue Medication Five or more prescriptions of antipsychotics (N05A) 6.6 3.5 1.94 (1.34 −2.80) .0004a1.71 (1.15 −2.55) .008a Five or more prescriptions of anxiolytics (N05B) 3.3 1.4 2.35 (1.40 −3.96) .001a2.1 (1.19 −3.70) .01a Five or more prescriptions of antidepressants (N06A) 12.5 9.2 1.41 (1.08 −1.85) .01a1.28 (0.96 −1.70) .09 Five or more prescriptions of psychostimulants (N06B) 4.0 2.9 1.43 (0.91 −2.25) .13 1.08 (0.67 −1.75) .74 Diagnoses F00−F09 Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders NA NA 2.00 (0.44 −9.17) .37 2.13 (0.44 −10.43) .35 F10−F19 Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use5.1 2.2 2.41 (1.58 −3.67) <.0001a1.93 (1.24 −2.99) .004a F20−F29 Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders 1.7 1.9 0.85 (0.43 −1.70) .65 0.74 (0.36 −1.51) .40 F30−F39 Mood [affective] disorders 3.3 3.1 1.08 (0.66 −1.77) .76 0.9 (0.54 −1.52) .71 F40−F48 Neurotic, stress ‐related, and somatoform disorders 7.5 5.5 1.41 (1.00 −1.97) .048a1.13 (0.80 −1.61) .49 F50−F59 Behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factorsNA NA 2.74 (0.76 −9.84) .12 3.84 (1.00 −14.69) .05a F60−F69 Disorders of adult personality and behavior 1.3 1.7 0.75 (0.35 −1.62) .47 0.62 (0.28 −1.37) .24 F70−F79 Mental retardation NA NA 0.53 (0.07 −3.93) .53 0.37 (0.05 −3.02) .35 F80−F89 Disorder of psychological development NA NA 0.45 (0.11 −1.87) .27 0.38 (0.09 −1.60) .19 F90−F99 Behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence5.0 3.2 1.59 (1.05 −2.41) .029a1.22 (0.79 −1.89) .38 Any psychiatric hospital contact 18.0 13.5 1.41 (1.12 −1.78) .004a1.15 (0.9 −1.48) .27 Abbreviations: AAS, anabolic androgenic steroid; NA, not applicable.
