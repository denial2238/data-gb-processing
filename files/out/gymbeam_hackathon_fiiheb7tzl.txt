Older adults tend to have low vitamin K in-takes, and low vitamin K status may attenuate effects ofvitamin D on bone. In this VITAL ancillary study, we testedin a case-cohort sample of 1,162 participants with fracturesand an age-sex-matched subcohort size of 2,652, whetherbaseline low vitamin K status, alone or in combinationwith lower 25(OH) vitamin D level, predicts incident total,non-vertebral, and hip fractures.The mean ( ±SD) age of participants was 68.3 ±7.2 years, 61.5% were female, and 81.7% was Non-Hispanic White.Fractures were reported on annual questionnaires and adjudicated through medicalrecord review.To assess vitamin K function, percent under-carboxylated OC (%ucOC) and dephosphorylated undercar-boxylated MGP ([dp]ucMGP) were measured in fastingbaseline blood samples, with %ucOC calculated from meas-ures of ucOC and total OC.Higher levels of %ucOC and (dp)ucMGP indicate lower vitamin K status.
Serum 25(OH)Dwas measured by LC-MS/MS and vitamin K biomarkersby sandwich ELISAs (IDS-iSYS Multi-DisciplineAutomated System). Participants with incident fracturehad higher baseline vitamin K status, as assessed by (dp)ucMGP levels, but this was not corroborated by %ucOC.Compared to participants with low baseline vitamin K sta-tus and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels below the median(30.0 ng/mL), participants with higher baseline vitamin Kand D status had a similar incidence of total and non-vertebral fractures.For the 91 hip fracture cases, baselinestatus of vitamin K and D did not predict hip fracture inci-dence.In this ancillary study, low vitamin K status by (dp)ucMGP and %ucOC, alone or in combination with baseline25(OH) vitamin D levels below the median, was not associ-ated with increased fracture incidence.
Ongoing analysesare assessing whether phylloquinone levels as another vita-min K biomarker predict incident fracture risk.Furthermore, we have also previously shown that the ef-fects of supplemental vitamin D on total and hip fractureswere not modi ﬁed by baseline vitamin K status in VITAL, the largest randomized controlled trial of supplementalvitamin D vs. placebo on fractures.From our ﬁndings inVITAL, higher vitamin K status does not protect against fractures.1.LeBoff MS, et al.NEJM .2022.Presentation: 6/1/2024 1Riga Stradins University, Latvian Osteoporosis and Bone Metabolic Diseases Association (LOKMSA), Riga, Latvia;2Riga East Clinical University Hospital (RECUH), Latvian Osteoporosisand Bone Metabolic Diseases Association (LOKMSA), Riga, Latvia 2, creatinine - 72.5 ±23.9 μmol/L.Parathyroid adenoma sizes ranged from 0.3x0.4cm to5.3x3.7cm.
Calcium levels positively correlated with aden-oma cross-sectional area ( ρ=0.187, p =0.029) and maximal adenoma dimension ( ρ=0.215, p =0.011). Ultrasonography convincingly detected parathyroid adenomas in 63.9%(107/168), SPECT/CT - 68.4% (52/76), 99mTc-sestamibiscintigraphy - 65.6% (61/93), 3D-CT - 70.6% (24/34),contrast-enhanced ultrasonography - 84% (21/25) andMRI in - 40% (2/5) cases.12.5% (n =21) pts had unlocated parathyroid adenoma.34.5% (n =58) of pts had osteopor- osis, 47.6% (n =80) osteopenia, 12.5% (n =21) had a history of osteoporotic fracture, 17.3% (n =29) had gallstones and 22.0% (n =37) - kidney stones.80.4% (n =135) of pts had thy- roid nodules, 48.2% (n =81) - nontoxic goitre, 24.4% (n =31) - autoimmune thyroiditis, 41.7% (n =70) - hypertension, 10.5% (n =18) - type 2 diabetes.18.5% (n =31) pts were found to have a diagnosis of malignancy.61.9% (n =104) of pts underwent parathyroidectomy.
Histopathology and radio-logic imaging revealed single parathyroid adenoma in95.2% (n =99), double parathyroid adenomas in 1.9% (n=2), parathyroid hyperplasia in 2.9% (n =3) and parathy- roid carcinoma in 1.9% (n =2) pts. The mean maximal post- operative calcium level (n =103) was 2.4 ±0.1mmol/L, iPTHA272 | Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A272
