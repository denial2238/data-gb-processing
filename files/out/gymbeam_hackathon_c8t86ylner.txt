How- ever, whether omega-3 can protect endogenous spermatogonia and the detailedmechanisms are still unclear. Evaluate of spermatogenesis function (in vivo) were examined by histopathological analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting.The levels of lipid metabolites in testicular tissue were determined via liquid chromatography.We investigated the effect of lipid metabolites on Sertoli cells pro- vided paracrine factors to regulate spermatogonia proliferation and differentiationusing co-culture system.In our study, we showed that omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved the process of sperm production and elevated the quantity of both undif- ferentiated Lin28 +spermatogonia and differentiated c-kit +spermatogonia in a mouse model where spermatogenic function was disrupted by busulfan.Mass spectrometry revealed an increase in the levels of several omega-3 metabolites in the testes of mice fed with omega-3 PUFAs.

Our study provides evi- dence that omega-3 PUFAs metabolite 12-HEPE effectively protects spermatogonia and reveals that GPR120 might be a tractable pharmacological target for fertility in men received chemotherapy or severe spermatogenesis dysfunction.1|INTRODUCTION The male reproductive toxicity of busulfan, which is a crucial drug for treating cancer, is widely known.
Busulfan can result in loss of sper- matogonia number and function,1and lead to male temporary or per- manent sterility.2,3There are no medically endorsed treatments available to enhance spermatogonia function in a non-invasive and safe manner, so it is critical to identify a good pharmaceutical strategyto minimize negative impact of busulfan. The regulation of spermatogenesis is controlled by the peculiar microenvironment found in the testes, consisting of Leydig cells, peri-tubular myoid cells, Sertoli cells, and the cytokines they secrete.4Ser- toli cells, acting as the main supporting cells, offer structural assistance, nutritional maintenance, and paracrine substances to con-trol the mitosis of spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes, and theconversion of round spermatids into spermatozoa.
5Studies have shown that Sertoli cells release bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neuregulins (NRGs),and Kit ligand (KitL), which regulate spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal and differentiation. 6–9Abnormal secretion of paracrine factors from Sertoli cells may lead to spermatogenesis dysfunction,which may eventually cause male infertility.10However, the mecha- nism by which paracrine factors in the microenvironment regulate spermatogenesis is still unclear, thus elucidating this mechanism mightprovide targets for the treatment of spermatogenic dysfunction.Male reproductive system contains testes and sperm, which pos- sess a unique lipid makeup and are abundant in omega-3 polyunsatu- rated fatty acids (PUFAs).These omega-3 PUFAs may have an impacton reproductive function and fertility.
11Many studies have shown that essential omega-3 PUFAs, mainly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), cannot be produced in most animals,especially humans de novo. 12In particular, PUFAs and their bypro- ducts not only function as secondary messengers within the cellular membrane but also demonstrate a diverse array of biological activi-ties.13,14The DHA and EPA compounds must be delivered to the body as therapeutic formulations or be consumed from dietary sources.The delivery systems of omega-3 PUFAs-containing three-dimensional supramolecular lipid assemblies can increase their bio-availability of pharmaceutical applications.
15Several clinical studies have suggested that supplementation with omega-3 improves sperm count and function.16,17Numerous researches have indicated that the level of unsaturation of PUFAs is associated with the fluidity andflexibility of the membrane, as well as the function of receptors and the achievement of successful fertilization in mature spermatozoa.18 Studies have shown that deficiency of PUFA elongation or desatura- tion enzymes in Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells has been linked to impaired spermatogenesis.19–21The concentration of omega-3 PUFAs in semen is notably reduced in oligoasthenospermia patients compared with in healthy men,22suggesting that omega-3 PUFAs might have a crucial function in controlling spermatogenesis.
Hence, itis necessary to conduct additional research on the local regulatory effect of omega-3 PUFAs and its metabolites on the microenviron- ment during spermatogenesis, and whether EPA/DHA themselves ortheir metabolites have a beneficial effect should be explored. A mouse model of busulfan-disrupted spermatogenesis and an in vitro co-culture system was utilized to explore the possible role ofomega-3 PUFAs in spermatogenesis.The results of our study indicatethat omega-3 mainly has a safeguarding effect on the reproductive system through its metabolites, triggering a signalling cascade of G protein by interacting with G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120),which may be involved in ERK activation, thereby promoting the para- crine function of Sertoli cells and regulating spermatogonial cell prolif- eration and differentiation.Our results suggest that omega-3metabolites can protect the reproductive system, providing new ideas and targets for clinical treatment.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 |Acquirement of human seminal plasma sample Between the hours of 8:00 and 11:00 AM, we collected samples of serum and seminal plasma from a total of 50 individuals. Among them were 25 patients diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA; n=21) or extreme oligospermia (EO; n=4), and the remaining 25 men were healthy individuals serving as controls.These samples were obtained during routine semen analysis at our clinical laboratory, specifically between September 2017 and January 2020.Please referto Table S1for further details.The age range of the individuals was between 20 and 43 years.After being subjected to centrifugation at room temperature for 10 min at a force of 1800 times the accelera- tion due to gravity, the serum samples were subsequently preservedat/C070 /C14C.After centrifuging the seminal plasma samples at a force of2o f2 2 JING ET AL.
12,000 times gravity for a duration of 5 min, they were subsequently stored at a temperature of /C070/C14C. The iFlash Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyser (YHLO Biotech, Shenzhen, China) was utilized to measure the levels of inhibin B in the serum.The analysis of sperm quality was conducted by employing a computer-assisted systemcalled WLJY-9000 (manufactured by WeiLi Co., Ltd, Beijing, China).Sperm criteria were deemed normal if the concentration of sperm exceeded 15 /C210 6/mL, the progressive motility showed more than 32%, the total motility was above 40%, and the rate of normal sperm morphology was higher than 4%.NOA was determined when there was an absence of sperm in either the analysis of semen or the biopsyof the testicles, without any abnormalities in the chromosomal karyo-type or deletion in the AZF region.Informed consent was obtained before collecting all clinical samples, and the Research Ethics Commit- tee of Jinling Hospital approved the protocol.
2.2 |Analysis of fatty acids in seminal plasma The levels of free fatty acids in seminal plasma were examined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Insummary, the specimens were defrosted on ice and supplemented with a solution of chloroform and methanol.Following the applica- tion of ultrasonication, the liquid portion was gathered.Next, a solu-tion of sulfuric acid-methanol with a concentration of 1% wasintroduced, and the mixtures were left to incubate at a temperature of 80 /C14C for a duration of 30 min to facilitate the esterification of free fatty acids.Afterwards, the methylated fatty acids wereobtained by extracting them using n-hexane and then rinsing them with water.GC/MS was utilized to determine the concentrations of methylated fatty acids employing an Agilent 7890A/5975C GC/MSequipped with an Agilent DB-WAX capillary column (30 m /C2 0.25 mm ID /C20.25 μm) (Agilent Technologies, CA).
The analysis involved quantifying the quantities of 39 free fatty acids withmedium and long chains (specifically, C6-C24). Shanghai AppliedProtein Technology conducted this analysis.2.3 |Animal models Male mice of the C57BL/6J strain, aged 5 weeks, were acquired from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co.They were kept in a controlled environment with a temperature range of 20 –26/C14C and a light/dark cycle of 12 h each.For every experiment, a total ofsix groups were formed by randomly assigning 6-week-old mice (n=6 per group) using the random number technique.All mice used in the experiment were housed in the animal facility located at JinlingHospital.The Animal Care and Use Committee of Jinling Hospitalapproved all animal experiments, which were conducted in compli- ance with institutional guidelines.
To establish a mouse model of sper- matogenesis disorder, an intraperitoneal injection of busulfan at adose of 35 mg/kg was given to mice as a single dose, aiming to disrupt the endogenous germ cells. Meanwhile, the control group was treatedwith intravenous injection of dimethyl sulfoxide.Following the admin- istration of busulfan, the mice received a 12-week consecutive gavageof omega-3 (produced by Chengdu Gowell Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) at a dosage of 2 g/kg/2 days.To investigate whether the effects of 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE; cat no.GC40359,Glpbio; 100 μL, 2μM/2 days) on spermatogenesis in the busulfan dis- rupted model could be inhibited by the GPR120 antagonist AH7614 (cas no.6326-06-3, Selleck; 100 μg/2 days), the mice were treated with 12-HEPE (gavage) with or without AH7614 (intraperitoneal injection) for 12 consecutive weeks.
2.4 |Assessing the counts and motility of sperm in mice Spermatozoa from a section of the cauda epididymis were discharged into 0.5 mL of human tubal fluid solution with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and maintained for 5 min at a temperature of 37/C14C. Immedi- ately after collecting the sperm, the standard method was used to determine sperm motility on a haemocytometer under a light micro- scope.The percentage of moving sperm cells was determined by cal-culating the number of mobile spermatozoa per unit area.Sperm counts were additionally assessed utilizing a haemocytometer, and the findings were presented as million mL /C01of suspension.2.5 |Histopathological examinations and immunohistochemical staining Testicular and epididymis tissue specimens were fixed in 4% para- formaldehyde.Sections were prepared in accordance with standardprocedures.Afterwards, the sections underwent staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Spermatogenesis and the thickness of the epithelium in all mice were analysed histologically. The Image Jsoftware from the National Institutes of Health in the United Stateswas used to determine the number and thickness of tubules using images taken at 200 /C2magnification.To block the activity of endog- enous peroxidase, the sections were subjected to treatment with a3% H 2O2solution for 3,3-diaminobe nzidine (DAB) staining and immunohistochemical analysis.To prevent binding to unspecified sites, a solution of 1% bovine albumin (BSA) in phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) was applied for 1 h at r oom temperature.Following this, the sections were then exposed to anti-GPR120 (Affinity, cat no.AF5219, 1:400) and anti-12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX; Santa Cruz,cat no.sc-365,194, 1:200) antibodies overnight at 4 /C14C.Afterwards, the sections were cleansed and s ubsequently incubated with a sec- ondary antibody, known as anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G.
DABstaining (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) was used to visualizeprotein expression. Distilled water was used to halt the reaction, and after staining with haematoxylin and dehydration, the sections were mounted.The IX73 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corpo-ration, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture and digitize the images.JING ET AL.3o f2 2 2.6 |Immunofluorescence staining The testicular tissues were treated with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for fixation and then dehydrated in different concentrations of ethanol (70%, 90%, and 100%).Following embedding in paraffinblocks, the tissues underwent sectioning and subsequent rehydra- tion, involving xylene for a duration of 30 min, followed by 5-min intervals of 100%, 85%, and 75% ethanol.To perform immunostain-ing, the sections underwent perm eabilization using 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20.
Following the addition of 3% (v/v) BSA to obstruct, the sections were subjected to incubation with anti-DEAD-box helicase4 (DDX4/MVH) (Abcam, cat no. ab13840, 1:100), anti-Lin28(Abcam, cat no.ab46020, 1:200), and anti-c-kit (Abcam, cat no.ab32363, 1:100) antibodies for an extended period at 4 /C14C.On the following day, the samples were exposed to secondary antibodies atambient temperature in the absence of light for a duration of 50 min.Additionally, they were stained with Hoechst (diluted to 1:2000; Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature.In order to per-form quantitative analysis of cells, the quantities of MVH +,L i n 2 8+, and c-kit+cells in each cross-section of the testis were tallied in five randomly selected fields per secti on.For each group, analysis was conducted on a minimum of three sections obtained from separate experiments.All images were obtained using an IX73 microscope.
2.7 |TUNEL staining Apoptotic cell detection was carried out using the One Step TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. In short, sections of testicu- lar tissue were fixed in a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde (volume/volume) for 60 min, followed by a single wash with PBS.Subse- quently, the tissue was exposed to PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min while kept on ice.After rinsing twice with PBS, the sectionswere treated with TUNEL fluorescent labelling solution and theenzyme TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) was introduced.Images were obtained with an Olympus microscope.2.8 |Transmission electron microscopy Testicular specimens in culture dishes were fixed with a solution of PBS and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for a duration of 30 min.Following immobilization in a 2% agarose gel, the samples were left to incubatefor 2 h in a water-based solution containing 1% OsO4 and 1.5% hexa- cyanoferrate (II).
Subsequently, they were washed with water and stored overnight at 4 /C14C in a 1% aqueous uranyl acetate solution. Fol- lowing a water wash and dehydration with acetone, the specimenswere then immersed in Epon for embedding.Thin slices (60 nm) were placed on copper grids coated with formvar, stained with uranyl ace- tate and lead citrate, and examined under a transmission electronmicroscope (JEM-1011, JEOL, Japan).Recordings of the images were made with a CCD camera mounted on the side.2.9 |Detection of lipid metabolites using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem massspectrometry (UPLC –MS/MS) The lipid metabolites from testicular contents were determined via UPLC–MS/MS.In short, the UPLC (Shim-pack UPLC Shimadzu CBM30A) and MS/MS (QTRAP 6500 +) system was configured with a resolution of 30,000 in order to acquire UPLC –MS/MS data.
The anal- ysis was conducted in positive ion mode using a spray voltage of 5.5 kV and in negative ion mode using a spray voltage of /C04.5 kV, while maintaining a capillary temperature of 500/C14C. The mass spec- trometer was set to scan 50 –1500 m/z.The nitrogen sheath and nitrogen auxiliary gas were adjusted to flow at rates of 30 and 10 L/ min, respectively.Solvent A consisted of 0.04% acetic acid (Fisher Sci- entific) diluted with water (Millipore) in a volume-to-volume ratio,while solvent B was prepared by combining 0.04% acetic acid (Fisher Scientific) with acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific) in a volume-to-volume ratio.The rate of gradient flow was adjusted to 0.4 mL/min, whilemaintaining a column temperature of 40 /C14C.The linear gradient was as follows: 5% B at 0 min, 95% B at 11.0 min, 95% B at 12.0 min, 5% B at 12.1 min, and 5% B at 14 min.To guarantee system stability, theQC samples were injected four times initially.
For all analyses, a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 column measuring 100 mm /C22.1 mm with a particle size of 1.8 μm was utilized. The contents of lipid metabolites were detected using MetWare( http://www.metware.cn/ ).2.10 |Isolation and culture of primary mouse Sertoli cells and spermatogonia Primary Sertoli cells from the testes of 20-day-old ICR mice (obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd) were isolated for analysing cell function.The isolation wasperformed utilizing a two-stage enzymatic digestion technique, aspreviously outlined.23The cells were incubated for 2 days at 37/C14C under a 5% CO 2atmosphere using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12; BasalMedia,Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HAKATA, Shanghai, China).Next, the cells underwent treatment w i t h2 0m MT r i s( p H7 .4 )f o rad u r a t i o no f3m i ni no r d e rt oe l i m i -nate germ cells.
Subsequently, they were rinsed with PBS and then cultured until ready for utilization. The method previously reported was used to isolate primary mouse spermatogonia.24To summarize, mouse spermatogonia were obtained from 6-day-old mice.The collagenase IV (Sigma) was used to digest the testes at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for 15 min at 37/C14C.Then, 0.05% trypsin –EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to digest for 5 min at 37/C14C.The cells from the testicles were gathered and placed onto a culture dish coated with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin.After a period of 2 h, the detached cells were gathered and placed onto a dif-ferent culture dish that had been coated with gelatin.Following three iterations, the detached cells were gathered and planted onto the4o f2 2 JING ET AL.feeder cells.Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from E12.5 embryos to create the feeder layer for spermatogonia.
TheStemPro-34 SFM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used as the SSC medium, which was supplemented with StemPro Supplement (Invitrogen), 25 mg/mL insulin, 100 mg/mL transferrin, 60 mM putres-cine, 30 nM sodium selenite, 6 mg/mL D-( +)-glucose, 30 μg/mL pyruvic acid, 1 μL/mL DL-lactic acid (Sigma), 5 mg/mL BSA (ICN Biomedicals), 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 /C210 /C05M 2-mercaptoethanol, MEM Vitamin Solution (Invitrogen), MEM non-essential amino acids solution (Invitrogen), 10/C04M ascorbic acid, 10 μg/mL Dbiotin, 30 ng/ mLβ-estradiol, and 60 ng/mL progesterone (Sigma). Primary mouse spermatogonia were placed onto a MEF feeder layer and incubatedwith SSC medium that contained 15 ng/mL GDNF and 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor at a temperature of 37 /C14C and 5% CO 2 for 7 days.It is important to regularly change the medium every 1 – 2 days.
2.11 |Culture of TM4 cell line and GC-1 cell line Sertoli cells from TM4 were cultivated in regular DMEM/F12 supple- mented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. GC-1 cells were grown in DMEM/Basic medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicil- lin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodiumpyruvate, and an additional 2 mM of L-glutamine.Procell Life Sci-ence & Technology Co.Ltd.(Wu Hai, China) provided the TM4 cell line, a mouse Sertoli cell line that is available for purchase commer- cially.The commercially accessible SSC cell line, known as the GC-1-cell line, was acquired from KE LEI Biological Technology Co.Ltd.located in Shanghai, China.The cells were cultured in a CO 2incubator with 5% humidity at a temperature of 37/C14C.2.12 |Cell treatment To uncover the mechanisms of 12-HEPE, we utilized Sertoli cells and spermatogonia in our investigation.
TM4 Sertoli cells and GC-1 sper- matogonia were treated with different concentrations of busulfan(0, 10 /C06, and 10/C04M), and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. TM4 Sertoli cells and GC-1 spermatogonia were treated with 10/C04M busulfan and harvested for the 5-ethynyl- 2-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and RNA and protein extraction.TM4 Ser- toli cells were treated with 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE; cat no.GC40361, Glpbio) (1 μM), 12-HEPE (1 μM), or 5-(6)-DiHETE (1 μM) (cat no.GC41119, Glpbio) and then with busul- fan (10/C04M) for 24 h.Then, the cells were collected for protein extraction.TM4 Sertoli cells were treated with 12-HEPE (1 μM) and collected at various time intervals (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) for western blot-ting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
In parallel, TM4 Sertoli cells were pre-incubated with vary- ing amounts of AH7614, an inhibitor of GPR120 (0, 10, or 25 μM) for 2 h and then with 12-HEPE (1 μM) for an additional 24 h. Following this, the cells were collected for protein extraction.TM4 Sertoli cells were subjected to treatment with 12-HEPE (1 μM) and collected atvarious time intervals (0, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 90 min) to analyse the levels of total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 MAPK.Afterwards, TM4Sertoli cells were treated with different concentrations of 12-HEPE (0 or 1 μM) and different concentrations of AH7614 (0 or 25 mM) or siRNA-GPR120 for different durations (0, 60, and 90 min).Prior towestern blot analysis of BMP4 levels, TM4 and primary mouse Sertoli cells underwent pre-incubation with the p-ERK inhibitor PD98059 (CAS 167869 –21-8, Selleck).
Subsequently, they were exposed to varying concentrations of PD98059 (0, 2, or 10 μM) for a duration of 2 h, followed by treatment with 12-HEPE (1 μM) for an addi- tional 24 h. 2.13 |Transfection of siRNAs GenePharma (Shanghai, China) designed and synthesized mouse GPR120-specific siRNAs (siRNA-GPR120) as well as a non-specific siRNA (scrambled siRNA; negative control).To knockdown theexpression of GPR120, cells were transfected with siRNA-GPR120 for 6 h before the indicated treatments.Cells were transfected with siRNA-GPR120 for a duration of 6 h prior to the specified treatmentsin order to suppress the expression of GPR120.The transfection pro- cess was carried out by utilizing lipofectamine 3000 reagent (cat no.L3000015; Invitrogen) in accordance with the guidelines providedby the manufacturer.Table S2displays the sequences of siRNA- GPR120.
2.14 |Co-culture experiment and conditioned medium treatment After transfecting TM4 or primary mouse Sertoli cells with siRNA-GPR120 for 6 h to knockdown the expression of GPR120, they were treated with both 1 μM 12-HEPE and 10/C04M busulfan for 24 h. GC-1 or primary mouse spermatogonia were placed in the bottomcompartment of a transwell plate (0.4 μm) at a density of 1 /C210 5/ well.The next day, the TM4 or primary mouse Sertoli cells (donor cells) were added to the top compartment of the transwell plate atsame density.After incubation for 24 h, the cells were collected to extract proteins.The medium of the Sertoli cells treated as described above was diluted 1:1500 and used to induce spermatogonia differen-tiation and proliferation.The spermatogonia were harvested for pro- tein extraction.2.15 |Assessment of ROS levels and EdU incorporation In addition, cell proliferation was evaluated using a BeyoClick ™Edu Cell Proliferation Kit with Alexa Fluor 594 (cat no.C0071 L; Beyo- time).
The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. Images were taken with an IX73 microscope and digi- tized.The fluorescent dye 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2DCFDA, KeyGEN BioTECH) was utilized to examine the levels ofJING ET AL.5o f2 2 intracellular ROS.In short, the cells that were treated were placed in DMEM with a concentration of 10 μMH 2DCFDA and incubated for 30 min at a temperature of 37/C14C.In addition, the proliferation of cells was assessed by employing a BeyoClick ™Edu Cell Proliferation Kit containing Alexa Fluor 594 (cat no.C0071 L; Beyotime).Images weretaken with an IX73 microscope and digitized.2.16 |Cell immunofluorescence To perform immunofluorescence staining, cells seeded in 24-well plates were treated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and fixed for a dura-tion of 20 min.Afterwards, cells were rinsed using PBS on three occa- sions, followed by blocking with 10% goat serum in neutral PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
Subsequently, they were exposed to arabbit polyclonal anti-GPR120 antibody (Affinity, cat no.

Table S3contains the primer sequences. 2.18 |Protein extraction and western blotting Samples of tissue and cells from the testis were rinsed with ice-cold 1/C2PBS and then immediately lysed in ice-cold RIPA (Sigma), supple- mented with 1 mM PMSF (Beyotime) and 1 mM protease inhibitorcocktail (Sigma).Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA test (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Protein with same concentrations were mixed with 1 /C2sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, heated at 95 /C14C for 10 min, and subse- quently placed onto Bio –Rad's Criterion TGX 4% –20% gels.After transferring, the proteins were placed onto polyvinylidene fluoridemembranes (Bio-Rad), and the quality of the transfer was evaluatedusing Ponceau staining.The membranes were obstructed for 1 h at room temperature in antibody diluent (NCMbiotech).
Subsequently, they were incubated overnight at 4 /C14C with the subsequent antibodies, which were diluted in 5% BSA: anti-PLZF (Santa Cruz, cat no. sc- 28,319, 1:200), anti-Lin28 (1:1000), anti-c-kit (1:750), anti-Stra8(Abcam, cat no.ab49602, 1:1000), anti-SYCP3 (Abcam, cat no.ab15093, 1:1000), anti-BMP4 (Abcam, cat no.ab39973, 1:1000),anti-Rdh10 (Proteintech, cat no.14644-1-AP, 1:1000), anti-GPR120 (1:1000), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, cat no.4370, 1:2000), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, cat no.4695, 1:1000), anti-Vinculin(Proteintech, cat no.66305-1-lg, 1:2000), and anti- β-actin (Proteintech, cat no.66009-1-lg, 1:3000).The membranes were rinsed three times for 5 min using 1 /C2tris buffered saline with tween- 20 (TBST) and subsequently exposed to the respective secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, which was diluted in 1 /C2 TBST, for 1 h at room temperature.
The membranes underwent threewashes with 1 /C2TBST and were subsequently treated with ECL solu- tion (Tanon Science and Technology) for development. The target band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software to calculate the relative protein expression.2.19 |Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism version 8 was utilized to conduct statistical analysis.The normality of the data was analysed first, and then statistical testswere performed.The Student's t-test, the Mann –Whitney test, and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test were employed.Metabolites that were significantly regulated betweengroups were identified using criteria including variable information pro-cessing (VIP) ≥1,p-value < 0.05, and absolute Log 2FC≥1.The orthogo- nal partial least squares-discriminant analysis results included score plots and permutation plots generated using the R package ropls, fromwhich VIP values were extracted.
The p-value for the significance of each metabolite was calculated using the Mann –Whitney test. The mean ± standard error of the mean represents all the remaining data.The figures represent p-values, which indicate the following: not signifi- cant [ns], p>0 .0 5 ;* p<0 .0 5 ;* * p< 0.01; *** p<0 .0 0 1 .3|RESULTS 3.1 |Patients with severe dyszoospermia have a notably reduced the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in seminal plasma Our clinical analysis focused on defect in spermatogenesis, specifically NOA and EO, in order to comprehend the potential correlation between the constitution of PUFAs and this condition.In order toexamine analyse free fatty acid levels in clinical samples, we collected seminal plasma from a total of 50 individuals, including 21 patients with NOA, 4 patients with EO, and 25 healthy controls.Using GC/MS,we quantified the concentrations of 39 free fatty acids (C6 –C24) with medium and long chains.
We focused on PUFA levels in seminal plasma and found that omega-3 PUFAs accounted for 31.84% of the total PUFA content (Figure 1A). As expected, DHA was the major component, accounting for 70.25% of the seminal plasma omega-3 content (Figure 1B).The seminal plasma omega-3/omega-6 ratio was6o f2 2 JING ET AL.reduced in patients with severe dyszoospermia (NOA and EO) com- pared with healthy controls, and this reduction was accompanied by a significant decrease in DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) levels but not a dramatic decrease in EPA levels (Figure 1C–F).However, patients with severe dyszoospermia (NOA and EO) did not exhibit any notable change in seminal plasma omega-6 levels of lino- leic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (ARA; Figure 1G,H ).These clinical metabonomic results indicate a relationship between deficiency of omega-3 PUFAs and disturbed spermatogenesis.
3.2 |Dietary omega-3 rescues busulfan disrupted spermatogenesis in vivo Low sperm counts and inadequate sperm motility are the primary fac- tors linked to male fertility. Our assessment aimed to determine whether omega-3 supplementation can restore spermatogenesis andimprove sperm production and maturation in mice.The experimental procedure was illustrated in the schematic diagram (Figure 2A), puber- tal or adult male mice received oral gavage of omega-3 and also givenbusulfan injection as a single dose.The weight ratios for the testis and epididymis of omega-3-treated mice were not significantly different from those of busulfan-treated mice for 8 weeks (Figure S1).The levels of sex hormones also showed no change between thesetwo groups (Figure S2).The DHA level in the testicular tissue of mice treated with busulfan was lower compared with that of control mice, which was consistent with a observably decrease in seminal plasmaDHA in patients with severe dyszoospermia.
Importantly, the omega- 3-treated mice showed a remarkably restoration of DHA level in their testicular tissue, which rescued the decreased DHA level due to thebusulfan treatment (Figure 2B). The omega-3-treated mice showed a significant rise in the quantity of tubules exhibiting both partial and complete spermatogen-esis and a dramatical reduction in the quantity of emptyspermatogenesis tubules, in contrast to the mice treated with busul- fan (Figure 2C,D ).The ultrastructural characteristics of the seminifer- ous tubule epithelium were assessed.The structural arrangement ofseminiferous tubule epithelium was partially restored in mice treated with omega-3, in contrast to those in busulfan group(Figure 2C).In testicular tissue of mice treated with omega-3, the thickness of the FIGURE 1 The omega-3/omega-6 ratio in seminal plasma is significantly lower in patients with severe dyszoospermia.
The proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) constitution (A) and different components of omega-3 (B) were measured. The omega-3/omega-6 ratio (F),docosahexaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (D), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (E), linoleic acid (LA) (G),and arachidonic acid (ARA) (H) levels in the seminal plasma were measured by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.The studyincluded a group of healthy controls ( n=25) and two groups of patients: one with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA, n=21) and the other with extreme oligospermia (EO, n=4).Compared with the healthy control group: * p< 0.05; ** p< 0.01; *** p< 0.001; ns, p> 0.05.JING ET AL.7o f2 2 FIGURE 2 Legend on next page.8o f2 2 JING ET AL.seminiferous tubule epithelium, which indicates spermatogenesis, also showed a dramatical increase when compared with those of micetreated with busulfan (Figure 2E).
H&E staining showed omega-3 treatment resulted in a notable rise in the quantity of sperm in the cauda epididymidis of mice, in contrast to the mice treated with busul-fan. (Figure 2F).Notably, the omega-3-treated mice exhibited a nota- bly higher sperm count compared with the busulfan-treated mice (Figure 2G).Sperm motility is essential for sperm maturation.In omega-3-treated mice, the motility of epididymal sperm was greater compared with busulfan-treated mice, but the difference was not sig- nificant.(Figure 2H).TUNEL staining indicated a reduction in the quantity of apoptotic spermatogenic cells in mice treated withomega-3, in contrast to mice treated with busulfan (Figure 2I).The ultrastructural characteristics of the spermatogenic cell nuclei were assessed.The spermatogenic cells of omega-3-treated mice showedpartial restoration of the nuclear structure when compared with the busulfan-treated mice (Figure 2I).
The spermatogenic cells of omega- 3-treated mice showed partial restoration of the nuclear structurewhen compared with the busulfan-treated mice (Figure 2I). In total, our results demonstrate that omega-3 therapy can expedite the recovery of spermatogenesis following busulfan treatment.3.3 |Dietary omega-3 increases spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation in vivo We further define if the therapeutical benefits of omega-3 were dependent on improving endogeno us population of spermatogonia.Testis sections were subjected to immunofluorescence for MVH to detect germ cells (Figure 3A,B ).In mice treated with busulfan, there was a low occurrence of MVH-positiv e cells found within seminifer- ous tubules, suggesting that busulfan caused long-lasting or irre- versible damage to spermatoge nesis.In contrast, there was a dramatical rise in the quantity of MVH-positive cells observed inmice treated with omega-3.
In addition, we investigated the pres-ence of Lin28, an indicator of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and c-kit, an indicator of differentiated spermatogonia, in all mouse groups (Figure 3A,C,D ). Omega-3 treatment resulted in a higher quantity of Lin28- and c-Kit-positive cells in the testicular cross- sections compared with those from mice treated with busulfan.Fur- thermore, in comparison to busulfan, omega-3 stimulated the pro-duction of proteins associated with undifferentiated spermatogonia (PLZF, Lin28), differentiated spermatogonia (c-kit, Stra8), and spermatocytes (SYCP3; Figure 3E–J).Collectively, these resultssuggest that omega-3 enhances the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia following busulfa n treatment, ultimately leading to the restoration of spermatogenesis.
3.4 |Dietary omega-3 changes the levels of lipid metabolites in testicular tissue To further explore the mechanisms that contribute to the beneficial impact of omega-3 on spermatogenesis, we examined the change in the levels of lipid metabolites in testicular tissue between theomega-3 and busulfan-treated groups. The metabolomics data fromthe two groups underwent principal component analysis (Figure 4A).The levels of total metabolites in mouse testicular tissue are shown in the heatmap (Figure 4B).According to the bar graph depicting differ- ential metabolites, the omega-3-treated group exhibited significantly elevated levels of four metabolites, and reduced levels of nine metab- olites compared with the busulfan-treated group.These changes inconcentration were indicated by the fold change (FC) (log 2FC≥1o r log2FC≤/C01) (Figure 4C).
Among the metabolites of EPA, the levels of 15-HEPE, 12-HEPE, and 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHETE) were significantly higher in the testicular tissue of mice treated with omega-3 (Figure 4D–G). In contrast, among the metabolites of ARA, the levels of 5-HETE, 9-HETE, 15-HETE, 16-HETE, 5-HETrE, 5-iso PGF2VI,5,15s-DiHETE, 15-oxoETE, and LTB4 were significantly lower in the testicular tissue of mice treated with omega-3 (Figure S3).These metabonomic data provide evidence that dietary omega-3 increasesthe levels of EPA and its metabolites in testicular tissue.3.5 |12-HEPE enhances BMP4 expression in Sertoli cells to rescue spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation We investigated how the increase in the levels of lipid metabolites contributes to spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation.A DCFH-DA assay was employed to measure the level of ROS follow-ing busulfan at concentrations of 10 /C06and 10/C04M using immuno- fluorescence.
After the administration of busulfan, there was a significant rise in ROS levels detected in GC-1 spg cells(a spermatogonia cell line) but not in a TM4 cells (a Sertoli cell line) within 30 min (Figure 4A). Thus, the damaging effects of busulfan- induced oxidative stress are greater on spermatogonia compared FIGURE 2 Dietary omega-3 protects busulfan disrupted spermatogenesis in vivo.(A) Diagram of the animal experiments and images of testis morphology.(B) The docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels in testicular tissue from each group ( n=6).(C) Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining images and transmission electron microscopy images of testicular cross-sections from each group ( n=8 per group; scale bar, 50μm).Testicular cross-sections were examined using representative H&E staining and transmission electron microscopy from every group (n=8; scale bar, 50 micrometres).

Interestingly, the inhibition of proliferation and differentiation- associated genes, including PLZF, Lin28, c-kit, Stra8, Rhd10, Aldh1a2 ,a n d Crabp1 , was observed in GC-1 spg cells when exposed to 200 mM hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2)o r1 0/C04M busulfan, in contrast to untreated control GC-1 spg cells (Figure 4B).Consequently, we investigated the impact of busulfan on the prolif- eration of GC-1 spg cells. The number of EdU-incorporating cells was decreased after treatment with 10/C04M busulfan (Figure 4C,D ).Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression of paracrine- associated genes, including BMP4 and Rhd10 , was inhibited in TM4 FIGURE 3 Dietary omega-3 increases busulfan disrupted spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation in vivo.(A) Immunohistochemical staining indicated that Lin28 (red) was expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia, and c-kit (green) was found in differentiated spermatogoniain all groups (scale bar, 50 μm).

In TM4 cells, the levels of BMP4 and Rhd10 mRNA expression were notably increased treated with 100 ng/mL 15-HEPE, 12-HEPE, and 5,6-DiHETE compared with TM4 cells treated with 10 /C04M busulfan (Figure 5F,G ). Furthermore, the levels of protein expression for BMP4 were higher in TM4 cells treated with 100 ng/mL 12-HEPE than those treated with 15-HEPEor 5,6-DiHETE compared with TM4 cells treated with 10 –4M busulfan (Figure 5H), so we chose 12-HEPE as representative metabolite for the following study.Treatment with 100 ng/mL12-HEPE significantly induced BMP4 mRNA and protein expression after 12 and 24 h, respectively (Figure 5I,J).The placement of TM4 or primary Sertoli cells treated with 12-HEPE in the upper chamberof a Transwell system, while GC-1 or primary spermatogonia wereseeded in the lower chamber (Figures 5KandS8A).
The expression levels of proliferation and differenti ation-related proteins, including PLZF, Lin28, c-kit, and Stra8, were significantly elevated in GC-1 orprimary spermatogonia treated with 100 ng/mL 12-HEPE compared with those treated with 10 /C04M busulfan (Figures 5Land S8A).

The levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE), 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE) and 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHETE) i n testicular tissue from the omega-3-treated group were markedly elevated compared with the busulfan-treated groups ( n=6).The data are displayed as the mean ± SEM.JING ET AL.11 of 22 Moreover, the number of EdU-incorporating GC-1 spg cells was increased after treatment of transwell system with 12-HEPE(Figure 5M,N ).The levels of proteins related to proliferation and dif- ferentiation in GC-1 spg cells cultured alone did not show an increase when exposed to 12-HEPE (Figure S5).12-HEPE signifi- cantly induced the secretion of BMP4 into the culture medium ofTM4 cells (Figure 5O).The results of the conditioned medium experiment were in accordance with the results of the co-cultureexperiment in this study (Figure 5P,Q ).
In summary, our findings reveal that 12-HEPE mainly enhances BMP4 expression in Sertoli cells, leading to spermatogonia proliferation and differentiationin vitro. FIGURE 5 Legend on next page.12 of 22 JING ET AL.3.6 |12-HEPE regulates BMP4 expression in Sertoli cells via the GPR120-ERK signalling pathway In order to resolve the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 12-HEPE on BMP4 expression, we assessed the localizationof 12-LOX, which converts EPA to 12-HEPE, and GPR120, a 12-HEPE receptor/sensor, in the mouse testes.Interestingly, the immunohistochemical staining revealed the accumulation of GPR120in the Sertoli cells in omega-3-treated mice, while 12-LOX was not visibly localized to and showed no changes in concentration in the testes (Figure 6A).These results suggest that 12-HEPE might be not produced in the testis but interacts with Sertoli cells.
Furthermore,treatment with 100 ng/mL 12-HEPE for 12 and 24 h significantly ele- vated the mRNA and protein expression of GPR120, respectively, compared with baseline levels (Figure 6B–D). We conducted additional investigations into the function of GPR120 in the 12-HEPE-mediated increase in BMP4 expression in Sertoli cells.We used a chemical antagonist of GPR120 (AH7614; pre-treatment with 0, 10, or 25 μM for 2 h pretreatment) and analysed BMP4 expression.The protein levels of BMP4 were dramatically reduced with increasing concentrations of AH7614 treatment com-pared with 12-HEPE treatment alone (Figure 6E).In addition, Sertoli cells were transfected with three duplexes of GPR120 siRNA and a scrambled siRNA.Among the three duplexes, it was observed thatsiRNA3 exhibited the most effective silencing effect (Figure 6F).Thus, siRNA3 was used in subsequent experiments.
However, the increase in BMP4 expression induced by 12-HEPE was evidently decreased via transfection with GPR120 siRNA3 compared with transfection withscrambled siRNA in TM4 and primary Sertoli cells (Figures 6Gand S8B). Next, we investigated whether activation of ERK1/2 is involved in 12-HEPE-stimulated BMP4 expression.12-HEPE (100 ng/mL)increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation as early as 60 min after treatment, then ERK1/2 phosphorylation remained increased compared with ini- tial levels after 90 min (Figure 6H).In addition, the increase in p-ERK1/2 expression induced by 12-HEPE was hindered by AH7614and siRNA-GPR120 (Figure 6I,J).The effect of 12-HEPE on ERK1/2 MAPK activation and the increase in BMP4 protein expression werenullified by pretreatment with increasing concentrations of p-ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 in TM4 and primary Sertoli cells (Figures 6K andS8C).
Furthermore, the expression of proliferation- and differentiation- related proteins, including PLZF, Lin28, c-kit, and Stra8, was markedlyinhibited by siRNA-GPR120 compared with scrambled siRNA in the co-culture and conditioned medium experiments (Figures 6L–Oand S8D). Overall, these outcomes suggest that 12-HEPE-induced BMP4 expression in Sertoli cells contributes to spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation by activating the GPR120-ERK1/2 signalling path- way in vitro.3.7 |Dietary 12-HEPE restores spermatogenesis through the GPR120 pathway in vivo To further determine the protective mechanisms of 12-HEPE in vivo, busulfan-treated male mice were given oral gavage of 12-HEPE andintraperitoneal injection of AH7614.The experimental procedure was illustrated in the schematic diagram (Figure 7A).The weight ratios for the testis and epididymis of mice treated with AH7614 were similarto those of mice treated with 12-HEPE (Figure S6).
The serum sex hormone levels also showed no change between these two groups (Figure S7). Interestingly, in the AH7614-treated group, tubules show- ing both partial and complete spermatogenesis exhibited a disruptedappearance (Figure 7B,C ).Notably, the seminiferous tubule epithelium thickness was also reduced and was similar between AH7614-treated mice and busulfan-treated mice (Figure 7D).Additionally, the mice treated with GPR120 antagonist exhibited a decrease in both sperm count and motility when compared with the mice treated with 12-HEPE (Figure 7E–G).Furthermore, the numbers of germ cells (MVH), undifferentiated spermatogonia (Lin28), and differentiated spermatogonia (c-kit) were lower in AH7614-treated mice than in 12-HEPE-treated mice(Figure 7H–K).
As compared to the 12-HEPE-treated group, the expres- sion of the paracrine factor BMP4, undifferentiated spermatogonia- related proteins (PLZF, Lin28), differentiated spermatogonia-related FIGURE 5 12-Hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE) enhances bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) expression in Sertoli cells to rescue spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation.

TM4cells were exposed to 15-HEPE, 12-HEPE, or 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHETE) followed by busulfan treatment for 24 h.Theexpression of BMP4 and Rdh10 at mRNA and protein levels was assessed using RT-qPCR and western blotting.(I,J) TM4 cells were treated with12-HEPE at various time points and the expression of BMP4 and Rdh10 at mRNA and protein levels were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blotting.(K) Schematic of the co-culture system including GC-1 cells and TM4 cells treated with busulfan or Bus +12-HEPE.(L) The protein expression of germ cell markers were assessed using western blotting in GC-1 cells.(M) The 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assaywas used to assess GC-1 cell proliferation (scale bar, 50 μm).

4|DISCUSSION In this study, we observed that patients with severe dyszoospermia exhibited a decrease in omega-3 levels in seminal plasma, suggesting that omega-3 supplementation may restore spermatogenesis(Figure 1). In testis, Sertoli cells facilitate the conversion of EPA to DPA and DHA through undergoing a series of elongation and desa- turation processes.25The seminal plasma is the last stage of testicular metabolism, so the proportion of EPA content was lower, while theproportion of DHA and DPA content was higher (Figure 1B).There- fore, significant differences were presented by the levels of EPA metabolites, DHA, and DPA, between healthy individuals and sub-fer-tile/infertile patients (Figure 1D,E ).This study is the first to demon- strate that omega-3 effectively protects spermatogonia from the effects of chemotherapy; specifically, it rescues spermatogonia func-tion by enhancing BMP4 expression in Sertoli cells.
We further found that some EPA metabolites, including 12-HEPE, were produced at high levels in the testes of mice administered omega-3 and that12-HEPE specifically induced BMP4 expression through theGPR120-ERK1/2 signalling pathway in Sertoli cells (Figure 8H). Together, our data suggest that 12-HEPE and GPR120, a receptor for long-chain free fatty acids, could potentially serve as therapeutic tar-gets for addressing spermatogenic dysfunction.
According to recent research, busulfan treatment can lead to the depletion of endogenous spermatogenic cells through variousmechanisms, including DNA alkylation, 26disruption of vimentin filament distribution,27,28disruption of SSC differentiation,29promotion of SSC dormancy,30and induction of ox idative stress.31 Therefore, depleting e ndogenous germ cells vi a a single injection of busulfan has become the most commonly used technique for estab- lishing animal models of disrupted spermatogenesis.32Many in vivo studies have suggested that omega-3 can alleviate testicular dam-age caused by environmental pollutants or metabolic disorders by alleviating oxidative stress, 33reducing apoptosis,34repairing the blood-testis barrier,35and protecting against DNA damage.36Nota- bly, our results showed that omega-3 could restore spermatogene- sis by increasing the thickness of the spermatogenic tubule epithelium, alleviating spermatogenic cell apoptosis, and increasingthe number of sperm in the caudal epididymis (Figure 2).
Omega-3 can enhance the differentiation of various types of cells, including skeletal muscle satellite cells,37neural stem cells,38adipocytes,39 and embryonic stem cells.40The process of spermatogenesis involves successive phases of prolif eration and differentiation, mei- otic division, and spermatogenic stages.41In mice, undifferentiated spermatogonia specifically express PLZF and Lin28, as reported instudies. 42–44C-kit and Stra8 are considered markers of differenti- ated spermatogonia.45,46SYCP3, a protein complex found in synap- ses, has a crucial function in the process of meiosis and isspecifically present in the init ial stages of spermatocytes.47,48MVH (DDX4) is characteristically present in cells that are part of the germ cell lineage.49The aforementioned proteins were utilized to iden- tify the particular phase of spermatogenesis from which these germcells originated.
According to our additional discoveries, omega- 3-activated endogenous spermatog onia self-renewal and differenti- ation after busulfan treatment b y promoting an increase in the numbers of undifferentiated spermatogonia (PLZF and Lin28) and differentiated spermatogonia (c-kit and Stra8; Figure 3), implying a role for omega-3 in the spermatogenesis process following injury tothe male reproductive system. In addition, our data indicated that omega-3 markedly increased the protein expression of the FIGURE 6 12-Hydroxyeicosapentaenoic aci d (12-HEPE) regulates bone mor phogenic protein 4 (B MP4) expression in Sertoli cells via the G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120)-ERK signalling pathway.(A) GPR120 and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry.The arrows indicate positive staining (scale bar, 50 μm).

an in vitro study, indicating that spermatogonia were more vulnerable to oxidative stress damage and suppression of proliferation and dif-ferentiation. Spermatogonia maintain a close connection with Ser- toli cells, which offer both structural assistance and paracrine substances to self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonia.During the early postnatal period, Sertoli cells secrete the paracrine factor BMP4, which stimulates undifferentiated spermatogonia to undergo both mitosis and differentiation, inducing Kit expression.6 On the other hand, retinoic acid (RA ) signalling can touch off the dif- ferentiation of spermatogonia and drive meiotic origination, which is regulated by FSH signalling in Sertoli cells within the testis.51The oxidation of vitamin A to retinol by retinol dehydrogenase10 (Rdh10) in Sertoli cells is critical for RA biosynthesis.
52Neverthe- less, it is unclear whether the omega-3-mediated recovery of sper- matogenesis was due to other specific factors in addition to areduction in oxidative stress. Thus, we further investigated which omega-3 metabolites showed an increase in concentration after busulfan treatment and specifically induced the production of para-crine factors and RA signalling in Sertoli cells.PUFAs undergo catal- ysis to produce different metabolites via the cytochrome P450, LOX, and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.53,54It has become increasingly evident that a large part of the physiological functions of ARA, EPA, and DHA are mediated via their oxylipins, which regu- lates numerous physiological processes, including inflammation,pain, and blood coagulation.55,56Our metabonomic data revealed that dietary omega-3 elevated the levels of the anti-inflammatory PUFA EPA and its metabolites but decreased the levels of the proin- flammatory PUFA ARA and its metabolites in testicular tissue(Figure 4).
Our findings demonstrate that the increase in 12-HEPE levels induced by the metabolites of EPA contributes to an increase in Sertoli cell-derived expression of BMP4 but not Rhd10, leading tospermatogonia proliferation and differentiation in vitro (Figure 5). Although we demonstrated that the testes do not produce 12-HEPE, it is plausible that additional cellular including adipocytes,platelets, or myeloid cells, could also affect the presence of 12-LOXmetabolites in the bloodstream due to the high expression of 12-LOX in these specific cell types.57–59These results suggest that 12-HEPE in the testes might originate from the circulatory system.Substantial studies recently have shown that GPR120 is a functional receptor for omega-3 PUFAs involved in regulating metabolic, endo- crine, and immune functions.
60–63The recognition of various double-bond positions of omega-3 PUFAs and the connection ofligand recognition to distinct effector coupling were attributed to aromatic residues located within the GPR120 ligand pocket.64In our research, we noticed that omega- 3 group exhibited a heightened GPR120 expression in testicular Sertoli cells compared with the control group (Figure 6A), implying that the function of Sertoli cells could be regulated by the binding of 12-HEPE to GPR120. In addi- tion, our work demonstrated that GPR120 was also located in Ley- dig cells, suggesting that 12-HEPE might also thought to help Leydigcells function.It was previously reported that the activation of GPR120/ ERK pathway was found to enhance testosterone produc- tion through LA stimulation in Leydig cells.65However, we found no change with testosterone levels in omega-3-treated mice.
It waspreviously reported that Consiste nt with a previous study that dem- onstrated that 12-HEPE can reinforce GPR activity and ultimately increase glucose uptake by brown adipocytes, 66we confirmed that 1 2 - H E P Ep r o m o t e dB M P 4e x p r e s s i o nv i aG P R 1 2 0a c t i v a t i o ni nS e r - toli cells (Figure 6). It is not clear from our study whether 12-HEPE might improve nutritional support to germ cells by enhancing glu-cose uptake and ultimately lactate secretion from Sertoli cells.Ear- lier studies indicated that PUFAs and their metabolites significantly i n c r e a s e dG P Ra c t i v i t ya n dt h e na c t i v a t e dE R KM A P Kp a t h w a yi nround spermatids, intestinal epithelial cells, and umbilical vein endo- thelial cells.67–69Recent research has shown that the ERK1/2 path- way regulates the proliferation, maturation, and paracrine functionof Sertoli cells.
70,71In agreement, our current investigation revealed that 12-HEPE accelerates BMP4 expression through excitation of the GPR120-ERK1/2 pathway. western blot analysis revealed a notable increase in the expression of p-ERK after 60 min of treat-m e n tw i t h1 2 - H E P E ,w h i c hw a ss u s t a i n e da t9 0m i n .B o t hs i R N A - GPR120 and AH7614, a selective GPR120 antagonist, significantly inhibited ERK activation induced by 12-HEPE in Sertoli cells.Inaddition, ERK1/2 activation was completely inhibited by PD98059.This ERK inhibitor also blocked the subsequent induction of BMP4 expression (Figure 6).Notably, co-administration of 12-HEPE and AH7614 hindered the capacity of 12-HEPE to restore the presenceof the testicular paracrine fact or BMP4 and endogenous spermato- gonia self-renewal and differentiation in mice treated with busulfan (Figures 7and8).
Hence, we conclude that the safeguarding proper- ties of 12-HEPE on sperm production are partly facilitated by its interaction with GPR120. Several recent studies have suggested that 15-HEPE can attenuate the production of inflammatorymarkers through peroxisome prolif erator-activated receptor gamma FIGURE 7 Dietary 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE) res tores spermatogenesis through the G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) pathway.(A) Diagram of the animal experiments and images of testis m orphology in all groups.(B) Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining images of testicular cross-sections from each group ( n=8; scale bar, 50 μm).Quantification of the quantity of seminiferous tubules exhibiting empty, partial or full sp ermatogenesis tubules (C) and tubule thickness (D) in relation to the control group.(E) Representative H&E staining images o f caudal epididymis cross-sections from each group ( n=8; scale bar, 50 μm).

First, it is that the contributions of two other me tabolites, namely, 15-HEPE and 5,6-DiHETE, to nutrition metabolism and the blood-testis barrier remain to be determined. Second, although we studied normalspermatozoa obtained from mice t hat received dietary omega-3 supplementation or 12-HEPE busulfan treatment, the fertility and condition of healthy offspring, in cluding physiological parameters, basic metabolism, and life expectancy, need to be assessed to evalu-ate the long-term effects of omega-3 and 12-HEPE on Sertoli and germline cells in the future.Finally, BMP4 is crucial for establishing the germ cell lineage before birth, and probably in early spermato-genesis.It is necessary to discuss the role of BMP4 in steady-state spermatogenesis.
It is important to note that BMP4 was reportedly detected in human Sertoli cells obt ained from the testicular tissue of NOA patients and that BMP4 transcription and protein expres- sion levels were considerably reduced in Sertoli cells from NOA patients compared with healthy individuals. 74,75The alteration of BMP4 expression in testis Sertoli cells may have an impact on the process of spermatogenesis.Howev er, considering the further dam- age to testicular function caused by testicular biopsy, we thought that metabolic detection techno logy may be able to better predict spermatogenesis potential through non-invasive detection of semi- n a lp l a s m am e t a b o l i t e s .W ea s s e s sed the reduction in the levels of seminal plasma omega-3 PUFAs in patients with severe dyszoosper-mia in our study.Further investigation is required to assess the value of PUFA metabolites, including 12-HEPE, in assessing testicu- lar spermatogenesis function.
For our research, we chosen oral omega-3 PUFAs and 12-HEPE supplementation for the experiments, but the perspective to use alternative formulations and other administration routes ofnanomedicines can be indicated in the context of evaluating theefficacy of different drug deliver y strategies. This could involve developing supramolecular assemblies that incorporate PUFA-chain plasmalogens into nanostructured mixtures with lyotropic lipids.76 Another perspective for the continuation of this work would be to combine omega-3 PUFAs with an antioxidant such as curcumin.This combination of drugs has been shown to enhance the expression ofneurotrophic factors.
77It may be expected that dual drug formula- tions (12-HEPE and antioxidant) may be beneficial for the outcome of spermatogonia proliferation and differentiation at much lower doses of administered omega-3 PUFAs.5|CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates that continuous supplementation with omega-3 can effectively accelerate the recovery of spermatogenesis fol- lowing chemotherapy by enhancing the self-renewal and differentiationof the remaining spermatogonia. We reveal that the endocrine factor 12-HEPE facilitates the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogo- nia via activating the GPR120-ERK1/2-BMP4 pathway in Sertoli cells.Given the harmless characteristics of 12-HEPE, along with its observed metabolic impacts and the mechanisms of action revealed in our investi- gation, 12-HEPE or 12-HEPE-mimetics showed a significant promise insafeguarding the reproductive abilities of boy individuals diagnosed withcancer.
In combination, our data not only uncover an unidentified mech- anism involving PUFA metabolites and the spermatogenesis microenvi- ronment, but also offer a safe and effective novel drug delivery strategyfor individuals with spermatogenic dysfunction.
