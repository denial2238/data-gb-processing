LETTERSTO THEEDITOR Asthma—timeforachangeofname?EDITOR,—In his robust defence of the term asthma,1Dr Speight has failed to grasp the signiﬁcance of the changed deﬁnition of thisterm.The original deﬁnition of asthma waspurelyfunctional:“airwayobstructionwhichvaries over the course of time and withtreatment”.2In small infants in whom lung functionmeasurementsarenotusuallyavail-able, this was modiﬁed to “cough and/orwheezeinasettingwhereasthmaislikely,andother rarer conditions have been excluded”.3 Bythisdeﬁnition,fewwouldquarrelwithDrSpeight’s wish 1to retain the term for infant wheezing.Unfortunately, to use Asher’s words,4“an abominable semantic crime has been com-mitted, a single term has knowingly beenapplied to two completely di Verent things without making the slightest e Vort to deter- mine if the one is the equal to the other, oreven related to the other.A pathologicalprocess and a collection of symptoms havebeen given the same name”.
Asthma is nowdeﬁned as “a chronic inﬂammatory disorderoftheairwaysinwhichmanycellsplayarole,including mast cells and eosinophils” 5or “a common and chronic inﬂammatory condi- tion of the airways whose cause is notcompletely understood”, 6and by these deﬁ- nitionsmanyoftheinfantswhomDrSpeightlabels as asthmatic have no such condition.Thisisnotmerelyoftheoreticalimportance,because there is abundant evidence that ear-lier treatment of T lymphocyte driven,eosinophil mediated airway inﬂammationwithinhaledcorticosteroidsisbeneﬁcialbothin terms of immediate symptomatic beneﬁtand long term preservation of lungfunction.
78Confusedly labelling infants who wheeze with colds as asthmatic, with theimplication of airway inﬂammation, willresult in exactly the same treatment policybeing advocated for them, despite evidencethat there is no beneﬁt either on acutesymptoms 9orlongtermlungfunction.10The safetyrecordofinhaledsteroidsisimpressive,but even in the short term,there is evidencethat overtreatment causes harm which is notreversedonstoppingtherapy. 11Furthermore, theﬁscalcostofthemedicationsisnotsmalland the long term e Vects are su Yciently imponderable as to make this not a subjectforcomplacency.Theissuesmaybedi Verentifthesolecon- cernisthelaudableoneofensuringacutelyillchildren get ambulances quickly.Speed is oftheessence,andaccuracylessrelevant.Inthissetting, the use of the term is justiﬁed, andhasinthepastbeenabsolutelyinvaluable.In1997,between consenting adults in the coldlight of day, the use of the unqualiﬁed termasthma is indefensible, unless the clock beturnedbackandtheolddeﬁnitionrestored.
ANDREWBUSH DepartmentofPaediatrics, RoyalBromptonHospital, SydneyStreet, LondonSW36NPDrSpeightcomments: In his indignation Dr Bush attacks not only my position but that of Professor SilvermanandDrWilson.IntheirarticleProfessorSil-verman and Dr Wilson argued that it isperfectly reasonable in clinical practice toboth label and treat episodic viral wheeze as“asthma”. 1Crucially,theypointedoutthatin early childhood it may prove impossible todistinguish between a future moderatelysevereperennialatopicasthmaticandamereepisodic viral wheezer (and of course bothmaywheezeinresponsetoviruses).The sheer practical value of using “asthma” as an umbrella concept far out-weighs Dr Bush’s academic objections.Justbecausesuccessivecommitteeshavechangedthe deﬁnition of asthma from (a) a clinicaldeﬁnition to (b) one based on bronchialhyperactivity to (c) one which emphasisesinﬂammation,doesnotmeanthatanydoctorwhoobjectsonthegroundsofcommonsenseshould be cast into outer darkness.

Wholebodybonemineralcontentin healthychildrenandadolescents EDITOR,—We were interested in the sugges- tion by Mølgaard and colleagues that wholebodybonemineralcontent(BMC)measuredby dualxray absorptiometry (DXA) should be considered as a function of bone area. 1 Using the same type of DXA equipment(Hologic QDR-1000W) we measured wholebody BMC in 300 normal girls aged 11–18years.2OurresultsforwholebodyBMC,both as a function of bone area and age, wereessentially identical to those of Mølgaard et al.1To assess the usefulness of area normali- sationinpatientswehaveanalysedtheresultsfrom71studieson51anorexicfemalesaged14–18 years.The patients’ clinical state wassubdivided into “moderate” (n = 44) and“severe” anorexia (n = 27) based on a bodymass index of 15.1–18.9 kg/m 2and < 15.0 kg/m2respectively.Height was within the normal range for age and there was nosigniﬁcantdi Verenceinageorheightbetween thetwogroups.
Z(Age)andZ(Area)werecalculatedusing thepredictedvaluesandSDsforagematchedandareamatchednormalsubjectsfromMøl-gaardet al. 1Mean (SD) Z(Age) was −1.01(0.84)and−1.45(0.95)forthemoder-ate and severe anorexic groups respectively.For both groups Z(Age) was signiﬁcantlylowerthanzero(p<0.0001)asexpectedandthe value for the severe anorexics was lowerthan that for the moderate anorexics (p =0.05).However,Z(Area)was1.85(1.39)and4.41(1.60) for the moderate and severe ano-rexic groups respectively.For both groupsZ(Area)wassigniﬁcantlygreaterthanzero(p< 0.0001) and the value for the severeanorexics was signiﬁcantly greater (p <0.0001)thanthatforthemoderateanorexics,which is a most implausible result.Reducedbonemineraldensityinanorexianervosahasbeen reported for speciﬁc anatomical sites 3 and a signiﬁcant reduction in total BMC inanorexicpatientshasalsobeenobserved.4 Our results in patients with anorexia nervosa illustrate that normalising wholebody BMC by the measured area is clearlyinappropriate.
Misleading conclusions couldbe made if this method is used to assess thebonemineralstatusofpatientswhomayhavea reduced bone content as a consequence ofdisease.Webelievethisanomalyisrelatedtoan artifact of DXA processing. A relatedanomalyhasbeeninvestigatedinlongitudinalstudies of adult women and with an anthro-pomorphic phantom.5The phantom results showedthatareductioninwholebodyBMCwasaccompaniedbyconcomitantchangesinthe measured bone area, even although thetrue skeletal area of the phantom was notaltered.Bothinvivoandinvitro,achangeoffat distribution led to spurious changes ofBMCandbonearea.Theseanomaliesvaried withthesoftwareversionusedintheanalysis.A similar anomaly has been reported forDXA spine scans.6This artifact may be due totheneedtoassignabonedensity“thresh-old” when determining which pixels repre-sentbone,withtheresultthattheareameas-uredbyDXAdependsontheBMCvalueandthe soft tissue composition and is not anadequate estimate of the true projected skel-etalarea.
Ourresultssuggestthattheboneareamay be signiﬁcantly underestimated in childrenwith diseases which are known to result inloss of bone mineral. We conclude that forHologic DXA systems normalisation ofwhole body BMC by area introduces signiﬁ-canterrorswhichmayresultinmisinterpreta-tionofthebonemineralstatus.Thesubstan-tial reduction in the coe Ycient of variation reported by Mølgaard et al 1when BMC is normalisedbybonearearatherthanagemustbe due in part to the spurious link betweenBMCandarea.WJHANNAN PTOTHILL SJCOWEN DepartmentofMedicalPhysics, WesternGeneralHospital, EdinburghEH42XU RMWRATE YoungPeople’sUnit,TipperlinHouse, RoyalEdinburghHospital, EdinburghEH105HF DrsMølgaard,Prentice,Cole,etalcomment: Hannahet alraise an important issue about the interpretation of bone mineral measure-ments in girls with severe anorexia.TheyreportveryhighBMCforboneareaZscoresinagroupofanorexicgirlsaged14–18years.

Hannanet alrefer to a “spurious” associ- ationbetweenBMCandbonearea.Thereisindeed a strong association between thesevariables,butitisnotspurious,itisgenuine.Thisisﬁrstlybecausebiggerboneshavemoremineralsonaverage,andsecondlybecauseofthenatureofboneedgedetectioninabsorp-tiometry. Although the algorithms have notbeendivulgedbythemanufacturers,itisrea-sonabletoassumethatboneisdetectedwhenbeam attenuation increases above a setthreshold.Fortwobonesofthesameexternaldimensions,asthebeammovesfromsofttis-sueintobone,thebonewiththehighermin-eral content will cause more rapid attenua-tion,willbedetectedearlieranditsmeasuredbone area will be greater.As a result,althoughboneareaiscloselyrelatedtoactualbone dimensions, it is also inﬂuenced byBMC.The relationship between BMC andbone area is not proportional in most cases,andisnotremovedbycalculatingbonemin-eraldensity(=BMC/bonearea).
7Normalisa- tionofBMCforbonearea,asinourstepwisediagnostic method, 1and in regression models,7allows for this association. This approachhastheadvantageofnotconstrain-ingthedatatoﬁtanarbitrary,oftenincorrect,relationship (that is bone mineral density)and so minimises the potential for misinter-pretation.In summary, we agree with Hannan et al that bone mineral assessments of girls withsevere anorexia can be anomalous.This isdue to erroneously low measurements ofbonearea,probablycausedbyproblemswithbone edge detection.It would be unwise toassumethatthecorrespondingBMCorbonemineral density values are valid or clinicallymeaningful in this situation.The identiﬁca-tionofthisproblemunderscoresthestrengthof our interpretative approach, 1which does not rely on the calculation of bone mineraldensity but makes use of all the informationavailable in a decision making tree andultimatelynormalisesBMCforbonearea.1 MølgaardC,ThomsenBL,PrenticeA,ColeTJ, Fleischer Michaelsen K.

Diurnalvariationinchildren:is stretchingtheanswer?

6In addition, pixel-by-pixel mapping oftherelaxationtimehasbeenusedtoassessthe water content and its distribution withinthe intervertebral discs in this group. Themean increase in height of the subjects,measured with a stadiometer, was 19.3 mm(range 8–26 mm) overnight.Image analysisshowed that the mean overnight increase involume of lumbar discs was 1300 mm 3.The increaseindiscvolumewasaccompaniedbyan increase in the T2 relaxation time of thenucleus pulposus.This suggests that thechange in disc volume is probably caused byapreferentialincreaseinthewatercontentofthe nucleus pulposus.Voss and Baileyobserved a mean loss in height of 31 mmbetweenthemorningandafternoon.This di Verence in diurnal variation in height between children and adults could beattributed to greater concentrations of puri-ﬁed proteoglycan macromolecules in thenucleus pulposus of children compared withadults, 7allowing more drawing in of water intotheintervertebraldiscsduringperiodsofrest.

Six boys aged 11–14 years (mean 12.0 years) received 40 mg daily for12.5 months (range 5–20) and then 80 mgdaily for another 10.2 months (range 6–15).In these six boys, pubic hair Tanner stage 2was observed after 5.8 months (range 5–8)andTannerstage3after15.5months(range12–20). The time interval of 10 months forprogressionofpubichairstage2tostage3iscomparable with the ﬁnding in normal boys.Intheirlongitudinalstudy,LargoandPraderobserved that in 52% of the boys pubic hairprogressedfromstage2tostage3withinoneyear.5In the ﬁrst year of treatment, height velocitywas7.2cm/year(6.0–9.0)andweightgain was 7.0 kg (5.2–8.0).Stretched penilelength increased from 3.5 cm (3.0–4.0)beforeto6.2cm(5.0–8.0)attheendoftreat-ment.We conclude that oral testosterone unde- canoatetreatmentinanorchidboysissimple,safe,ande Vective.Startingattheageof11to 12 years with a dose of 40 mg daily for oneyear and 80 mg daily for another yearprovides for a gentle induction of pubertywith normal tempo.

Persistenceofneurologicaldamage inducedbydietaryvitaminB-12deﬁciency E DITOR,—Cases with symptomatology simi- lar to one described by von Schenck et al1 havebeenamplyreportedinIndianliterature under “infantile tremor syndrome”,2a term very familiar to the paediatricians of theregion.Followingitsﬁrstdescriptionin1957by Dikshit, 3many more such patients were described in subsequent years.2The syn- drome,a Vectingexclusivelybreastfedinfants from low socioeconomic conditions,is char-acterised by a constellation of neurological,haematological, and skin changes. A Vected infants, though plump and chubby, arefrequently subnormal in weight and stature.Neurologicalsymptomsincludeapathy,leth-argy,expressionlessface,hypotonia,develop-mental retardation/arrest, and laterregression.Involuntary movements, usuallytremors, often supervene abruptly in amajority of the cases.
The cry is peculiar(highpitchedandtremulous).Skinhyperpig-mentation, most marked over dorsum ofhandsandfeetcontrastswiththegeneralisedpallor of anaemia. Hair is often sparse anddepigmented.Documented vitamin B-12deﬁciency, megaloblastosis, and therapeuticresponse to vitamin B-12 administration hasbeenobservedinsomebutnotallpatients.45 It is also suggested that megaloblastosis is aFigure1 (A)Liverhistologyatage6showingaseverehepatitiswithfocalcellnecrosisand prominentmultinucleatedgianthepatocytes.(B)Fourmonthslaterthereisamarkedprogressionoftheparenchymalloss,withonlyscatteredsurviving,mostlymultinucleated,hepatocytes,setinalooseandmildlyinﬂamedﬁbrousmatrix(haematoxylinandeosinstain ×125).398 Letters,Bookreviews late feature of the syndrome.5In other instances deﬁciency of other vitamins orminerals has been implicated, though thetherapeuticresponsetosupplementationhasbeenpoor.

To ensure that thisobjectivecontinuestobefulﬁlledweneedtocreateaclimatewhichwillencouragetraineestopursueanacademiccareer.Severalrecentarticles,however,havereporteddiscontentinacademic medicine. 1–3In addition Raine recently described the paucity of hard infor-mation about the career paths of juniorpaediatric sta Vstudying for MDs.4This makesitvirtuallyimpossibletoassessthetruestateofresearchandisabarriertoimprovingboth standards and recruitment.This prob-lemcouldbeaddressedbyasystemofregis-tration and monitoring for all trainees andsupervisorsengagedinresearch,andalsofortheir host institutions.This proposal hasother beneﬁts:it would strengthen academictrainingbypeerreviewofprojectsatanearlystage, allow supervision of supervisors, andpastoralcareforresearchers.Trainees think that academic medicine lacks a formal training programme, takeslonger, and is a more risky career strategythanclinicaltraining.
5Theseperceiveddi Ver- ences have been exacerbated by the imple-mentation of Calman, and are of particulatrelevance to paediatrics where a highproportionoftraineesarefemale.Inaddition,therehastraditionalybeenmoreemphasisonclinical skills than research during paediatrictraining. Practical measures, such as anassessment of competance when awarding a certiﬁcate of completion of specialist train-ing, rather than just time of service, mayencourage paediatricians to pursue an aca-demiccareer.Finally,Calmanhasimposeda“regional” structure on medical trainingwhich may penalise trainees in small disci-plines, which are particularly common inpaediatrics.Thisissuecouldbeaddressedbyfacilitating movement between regions indesignatedspecialties.Many of the changes which we have suggested require a signiﬁcant readjustmentof attitudes to academic research in paediat-ric training.
Such changes would have beendiYcult to implement in the past, but the creation of our new college with its statedcommitment to improving “the science ofpaediatrics” provides a perfect springboardforthesenewinitiatives.

(Serial: British Medical Bulletin1996;52:No4.) Dramatic improvements in the diagnosis, management, and ﬁnal outcome of childrenwith a malignancy have been seen over thepast 30 (particularly in the last 10) years.Rather than make this slim book a compre-hensivetextbookonpaediatriconcology,edi-tor James Malpas has selected topics whichcover areas where the recent growth ofknowledgehasbeenespeciallymarked.Intheintroduction Professor Malpas outlines howtreatment for these children has progressedoverthe30yearperiodwiththedevelopmentof new chemotherapeutic agents and treat-ment schedules, and the establishment ofhighly organised cooperative groups runningthe treatment programmes.
The UnitedKingdom Children’s Cancer Study Group(UKCCSG), formed in January 1977, nowrunsmanyofthecooperativetrialsintheUK.Almost all of the chapters in this book havebeen written by UK members of theUKCCSG.ExceptionsareRickWomerfromPhiladelphia who has written on childhoodsarcomas, and Jose Brosard and his col-leagues from Montreal Children’s Hospitalwho have contributed a chapter on neuro-blastoma. Newﬁndingsinthegeneticsandbiologyof neuroblastoma have led to an improvedunderstandingofthebehaviourofthiswildlyvariable tumour.As examples, both ampliﬁ-cation of the n-myc gene and loss ofheterozygosityofchromosome1pinneurob-lastoma cells may predict a poor prognosis.The genetics of paediatric malignancies arecovered in several chapters including adiscussiononitsimportanceintheoriginsofchildhood cancer.Lymphoblastic leukaemia,non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, acute lympho-blastic leukaemia, and paediatric myelodys-plasiasareallcoveredinseparatechapters,asarebraintumoursandhistiocytedisorders.
Chemotherapy is vital in treating most childhoodmalignancies;onechaptercompre-hensively covers the pharmacological andclinical aspects of new and well establishedpaediatricanticanceragents.Othermoregen-eral chapters include the epidemiologicalfactors relevant to the incidence of childhoodcancer, cancer in adolescence (which isincreasingly managed by paediatricians), andofcourse,thelastaddressesthecrucialareaoflongtermsurvivors.Aswithallbookscontain-ing a collection of separately written reviewssomechaptersaremoreinformativethanoth-ers. However, that apart, this book is packedwith up-to-date information on paediatricmalignancies and I recommend it toanyone involved in the care of children with cancer.KATEWHEELER Consultantpaediatriconcologist Diagnosis and Management of Paediatric Respiratory Disease.2nd Ed.By Robert Dinwiddie.(Pp 352; £40hardback.) Churchill Livingstone, 1997.ISBN0-443-05084-8.
An English summer day with rain pouring down outside seemed the ideal opportunityto tackle Bob Dinwiddie’s Diagnosis and Management of Paediatric Respiratory Disease . Like many single author texts this is wellwritten,easilyread,andinternallyconsistent.The task is enormous:to cover the whole ofrespiratorydiseaseinaslimvolume.Itistheidealmembershiptextwithsu Ycientdetailto provide answers for all commonplace ques-tionsandgoodreferencesforfurtherreading.The down side is that the information issometimesratherhiddeninthetextandbet-ter use could be made of bullet points,diagrams,andtables.Paediatric respiratory disease is a fast growing subspecialty and new informationfrom molecular genetics and biology isbroadening our understanding if not yetdirectly a Vecting management.Many exam- ples could be given:in the understanding ofcystic ﬁbrosis, the basis of wheeze andasthma, the production of mucins, and theroleofdefensinsandantibacterialpeptidesinthe lungs.
Little of this excitement istransmitted in this text,which is a main linepracticalbook. It is of course di Ycult to maintain a balance between being comprehensive andproviding su Ycient depth.The chapter on immune disease in the lung is excellent butoccupies32pageswhileasimilar30pagesaredevoted to asthma.The asthma chapter isdisappointing.Dr Dinwiddie is clearly a“lumper” rather than a “splitter” and theinterestingandcontroversialareaofwheezingin infancy is not really addressed.I liked theshort chapter on rare diseases of the lung.The choice and reproduction of radiographswasexcellentthroughout.
Many single author textbooks are decid- edly idiosyncratic in management recom-mendations such that one sometimes won-dersiftheyaresingleauthorbydefault.Thisis decidedly not so in this text.Managementsuggestions are practical and straightforwardandIhadonlysmallquibbles.Idonotthinka possible foreign body aspiration is amandatoryindicationforrigidbronchoscopybutprefertolookﬁrstusingaﬂexible’scopeunder sedation and proceed only to generalanaestheticandrigidbronchoscopyifthereisa foreign body present. Piperacillin shouldnot be recommended as a ﬁrst choiceintravenous antibiotic in cystic ﬁbrosis be-cause of the high risk to patients of allergicreactionsincludinganaphylaxis.Overallhoweverthisbookrepresentsmain- stream British diagnosis and managementand is recommended reading for thoseseeking further information on respiratorydisease in children.Unfortunately it will notattract or stimulate the next generation ofclinicalscientists.ANNETHOMSON Consultantpaediatrician400 Letters,Bookreviews
