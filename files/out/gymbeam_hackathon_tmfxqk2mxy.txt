All patients underwent a detailed diagnostic workup to exclude competing causes reasonably. Where possible, the implicated herbal formulation was retrieved and subjected to chemical analysis.Results: Out of 23 patients with liver injury from ashwagandha (January 2019 to December 2022), we report 8 patients with single-ingredient formulation-related HILI.Study cohort was male predominant, and cholestatic hepatitis was the commonest presentation.Five patients had underlying chronic liver disease; 3 presented with acute-on-chronic liver failure, and all 3 died on follow-up.In others, the liver injury was prolonged, nonetheless self-limiting.Liver biopsy revealed cholestatic features predominantly with hepatocellularnecrosis and lymphocyte/eosinophil predominant portal-based inflammation.One patient progressed to chronic HILI.Chemical analysis revealed only natural phytochemicals without adulteration or contamination.

INTRODUCTION Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are considered food and nutritional formulations that include vitaminsand minerals, whole herbs or botanical parts, aminoacids, organ tissues, enzymes, and metabolites that are intended to promote health and well-being or adjunc- tively restore wellness associated with diseaseconditions. [1]The HDS is not considered drugs/medica- tions, and the responsibility for the safety of suchproducts lies with the respective manufacturers, whilegood manufacturing practices approval from concernedhealth regulatory bodies is required before marketing.The good manufacturing practice establishes minimum standards for raw source utilization and procurement, storage, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling of HDSproducts to ensure purity, quality, and composition.Manufacturers of HDS formulations are not required toconduct preclinical safety and efficacy studies beforeproduct marketing.
[2]Hence the adverse events related to the use of such products are usually identified onpostmarketing surveillance from responsible public health regulatory bodies, specific adverse-events recognition action groups or reported by physiciansand patients themselves. Herbal drugs and dietarysupplements are a major growing concern for liverinjury, liver failure, and death or liver transplantationglobally.[3–6]Ayurvedic herbal supplements have been implicated in serious liver injury, acute decompensationof cirrhosis, and acute-on-chronic liver failure.[7–9]With- ania somnifera , popularly known as ashwagandha (also Indian Ginseng, Winter Cherry), is a commonly usedand marketed herb as part of Ayurvedic herbals anddietary supplements for relieving stress and anxiety,improving sleep, increasing muscle mass and strength,improving sexual function in both males and females,increasing memory and as “immune-booster.
” [10]None- theless, conclusive evidence from rigorous, methodo- logically sound, well-designed, validated, and replicated trials does not exist for the aforementionedindications. [11–13]The increasing use of ashwagandha for advertised but nonevidence-based indications hasled to an increase in published reports associated withits liver toxicity.After the first report on ashwagandha-induced cholestatic liver injury from Japan was pub-lished, the United States —(DILI) Network (US-DILIN) and colleagues from Iceland thereafter published a series of 5 patients with ashwagandha hepatoxicity.Multiple reports have been published on ashwagandha- related liver injury, mostly from centers in the UnitedStates, along with large numbers of self-reportedadverse events, such as severe itching, based onanalysis of commercial websites.[14]The estimated production of ashwagandha roots in India is >1500 tones and the annual requirement is about 7000 tones.
As per the Charan Singh National Institute ofAgricultural Marketing set up by the Government ofIndia, the average annual Indian domestic consumptionof ashwagandha within 5 large states was39,074.592 kg. [15]There are no reports of ashwa- gandha-related liver toxicity published from the Asiancontinent.We present 8 cases of severe liver injury due to the ashwagandha herb from 3 tertiary centers in India.METHODS Institutional electronic medical records of 3 hospitalswere queried to identify 8 cases of ashwagandha-related liver injury from between January 2019 and December 2022.Patients consuming ashwagandha-only formula-tions were included.Those consuming ashwagandha aspart of multiherbal products or ashwagandha along withother potentially toxic herbal supplements or prescriptiondrugs were excluded from this analysis.We alsoexcluded patients with active alcohol use and those withother competing causes of acute liver injury.
A detailed diagram of the inclusion methodology of patients is shown in Supplemental Figure S1, http://links.lww.com/ HC9/A532 . All patients underwent a detailed diagnostic workup to exclude other well-known causes for liverinjury.The evaluation included laboratory investigations,viral serologies for acute and chronic hepatotropicviruses, including HEV infection, and others such asHerpes simplex and cytomegalovirus, Ebstein-Barr virus, Dengue virus, the novel coronavirus, and other pertinent nonviral infectious agents such as malaria parasite,Rickettsia, and Leptospira.Biomarkers for autoimmuneliver disease and diagnostic cross-sectional imagingwere performed in all patients.In all cases, the liver injurywas classified into hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixedtype based on the R-ratio, using initial (at the time ofpresentation to respective centers) values of alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, their respective upper limits of normal.
The R-ratio was calculated as2|HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS alanine transaminase/upper limits of normal ÷alkaline phosphatase/upper limits of normal. When the R-ratio was <2, the liver injury was defined as cholestatic, between 2 and 5 as mixed, and >5 as hepatocellular.Thereafter, the causality assessment was performed todiagnose highly probable (score >8), probable (6-8), possible (3-5), and unlikely(1-2 or less) DILI using the 7-point Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method(RUCAM).[14]Percutaneous or transjugular liver biopsy was performed in all patients after informed consent.Patients were categorized into mild, moderate, or severeDILI based on bilirubin levels and liver failure.
Mild DILIwas defined when the liver test elevations reachedcriteria for DILI, but bilirubin concentration was <2.5 mg/ dL, moderate when bilirubin ≥2.5 mg/dL or symptomatic hepatitis, severe when the bilirubin level was ≥2.5 mg/dL with signs of liver failure (international normalized ratio≥1.5, presence of ascites or encephalopathy) or another organ failure directly attributed to DILI and finally,fatal, with death or liver transplantation due to DILI within6 months of onset. [16]Where possible, the implicated ashwagandha formulations were retrieved for furtherchemical and toxicology analysis.Heavy metal concen-tration was determined by an inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectrometer (Thermo Electron, IRIS Intrepid II XSP Duo, Munich, Germany).The method- ology, chemical standards, reagents, and vials wereacquired per standards set by the US EnvironmentalProtection Agency (USEPA), method 5021A, 8015,8021, and 8260.
Complete qualitative analyses wereperformed using triple-quadruple gas chromatographycoupled to tandem mass spectrometry method (Varian FIGURE 1 The various types of ashwagandha formulations that were retrieved from patients. The products marked with a green tick are single-ingredient ashwagandha products, the use of which was one of the inclusion criteria.This study did not include patients using multiherbal products containing ashwagandha as a predominant or additional ingredient.
The products which are marked with a “blue beaker icon ”were considered adequate and unspoiled for further chemical analysis.ASHWAGANDHA-INDUCED LIVER INJURY: A CASE SERIES |3 TABLE 1 Demography and clinical details of patients with ashwagandha-induced liver injury Patient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Patient 4 Patient 5 Patient 6 Patient 7 Patient 8 Sex Male Female Male Male Female Male Male Male Age (y) 75 31 34 58 50 39 68 47 Diabetes Yes No No Yes No No Yes No Hypertension No No No No No No Yes No Overweight or obeseNo No No No Yes No No No Chronic liver diseaseYes No Yes No No Yes Yes Diagnosed during event Etiology of chronic liver diseaseNAFLD — NASH —— Alcohol (abstinent) NAFLD Cryptogenic Other comorbidities None None None NHL in long remissionBipolar disorder None None None Co-medications Insulin, oral hypoglycemic agentsNone None None Amisulpride and lithium for over 3 yNone Insulin, oral hypoglycemic agentsNone Indication for ashwagandha useInsomnia Postpregnancy “stress ”Appetite stimulant“Anticancer ” preventiveStress detox and sleep aidFever General wellness and energy boosterGeneral wellness and energy booster Duration of herb intake (d)30 14 60 94 540 30 60 17 Dose Approximately 20 g/d10–15 g/d 10 –15 g/d 500 mg daily ~100 mL daily Manufacturer instructionManufacturer instructionManufacturer instruction Time to symptom onset (d)24 14 52 96 540 30 62 15 Onset of lab abnormalities (d)35 14 62 100 546 30 65 16 Predominant symptomsLethargy and jaundicePruritus Pruritus and jaundiceJaundice and pruritusPruritus and jaundiceJaundice and abdominal distensionLethargy and jaundiceJaundice and pruritus Clinical presentation ACLF Acute hepatitis Acute hepatitisAcute hepatitis Acute hepatitis ACLF Acute hepatitis ACLF Steroid use for treatmentNo No Yes, 40 mg/ d for 15 dYes, 40 mg/d for 30 dNo No Yes, 40 mg/d for 30 dNo Resolution of HILI No Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes No Time to resolution (d)45 30 60 95 — 56 — Outcome Dead Alive Alive Alive Alive Dead Alive Dead Time from diagnosis to final follow-up (d)288 375 430 486 235 30 302 2424|HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS Saturn 2200; Agilent Technologies, USA).
The study was performed conforming to the Helsinki Declaration of1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008, concerning humanrights, and the study design and retrospective collectionof patient data were approved by the respectiveinstitutional ethics and review boards. Owing to theretrospective pooled analysis but not the individualistic scrutiny of existing clinical data, the respective institu- tional review boards waived the requirement to obtaininformed patient consent.PATIENTS General features and clinical details Out of 23 patients with liver injury from herbal supplements containing ashwagandha, we included 8patients with liver injury due to pure ashwagandhaformulations.The other 15 patients were excludedbecause they had consumed concomitant potentiallytoxic herbal formulations or were on ashwagandha-based multiherbal preparations, or had other competing causes for liver injury (Supplemental Figure S1, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A532 ).
Of the 8 patients in- cluded in the study, 6 were males and 2 were females.The median age was 49 (range 44, minimum 31 tomaximum 75) years. Three patients had diabetes orhypertension and had been on medications for thesame for decades without any significant prescriptiondrug modifications pertinent to current events.Three patients were known to have pre-existing chronic liver disease, while 2 patients were diagnosed to haveunderlying chronic liver disease during the evaluation ofherb-induced liver injury (HILI).Among the latter 2, onewas diagnosed with HILI on the background of NASHon liver biopsy, while the other patient had imagingfeatures of cirrhosis and portal hypertension during theevaluation of HILI.One patient had a history of non- Hodgkin lymphoma in remission for 4 years.Three patients presented with acute-on-chronic liver failure(ACLF) at the outset.
The median duration of herbintake was 45 (interquartile range 53.5, minimum 14 tomaximum 540) days, and the median time to symptomonset was 41 (interquartile range 59.5, minimum 14 tomaximum 540) days. The dose of ashwagandha rangedfrom 10 to 15 g/d to 500 mg per day based on the type of formulation or as labeled on the product.The most common presenting symptom was jaundice (N =7/8, 87.5%), followed by pruritus (N =5/8, 62.5%).The median follow-up from diagnosis of HILI to outcomewas 295 (interquartile range 164, minimum 30 tomaximum 486) days.
The indications for ashwagandhause were insomnia and antistress in 2, postpregnancydetox in 1, appetite stimulant in 1, anticancer prevention (who was already in long-term remission from non- Hodgkin lymphoma) in 1, fever reduction in 1, and as aAshwagandha product consumedHomemade powderLehyam (herbal jam)Branded powderNonbranded tabletsDetox tea Branded powder Branded powder and tabletsBranded powder and syrup Person who prescribed theherbSelf, OTC Ayurveda practitionerSelf, OTC Ayurveda practitionerSelf, OTC Ayurveda practitionerAyurveda practitionerAyurveda practitioner Abbreviations: ACLF, acute-on-chronic liver failure; HILI, herb-induced liver injury; NHL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma; OTC, over-the-counter.ASHWAGANDHA-INDUCED LIVER INJURY: A CASE SERIES |5 “wellness and energy booster ”in 2 patients.
The various types of ashwagandha formulations consumed bypatients included homemade powdered roots, herbaljam preparation (called lehyam), company-manufac-tured branded ashwagandha root formulations aspowders, syrups, and tablets, nonbranded Ayurvedapractitioner-prepared tablets, and herbal detox tea. All patients consumed ashwagandha per the practitioner ’s advice or product labeling.A detailed representation ofvarious ashwagandha formulations retrieved from thepatients and the specific formulations that were sub-jected to chemical analysis and toxicology are showninFigure 1 .A registered and certified Ayurveda practitioner prescribed the ashwagandha supplementto 5 patients, while 3 reported self-use of over-the- counter supplements.The complete general features and clinical details of 8 patients are shown in Table 1 .Investigations and outcomes T h et y p eo fl i v e ri n j u r ya c c o r d i n gt ot h eR - r a t i ow a s cholestatic in 4, hepatocellular in 3, and mixed in 1.
The RUCAM score revealed probable ashwagandha-induced liver injury in 6 and possible liver injury in 2 patients. TheHILI was severe in most patients included (N =6/8, 75%).Three patients died (mortality 37.5%; at 30, 242, and2 8 8d ) .A l lt h ep a t i e n t sw h od i e do nf o l l o w - u ph a di n d e xHILI presentation as ACLF.The complete individualinvestigations of 8 patients are shown in Table 2 .B r i e f l y , pertinent pooled findings included median hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, total white cell count 8.7 ×10 9/L, platelet count 168.5 ×103/μL, the median total bilirubin 13.8 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 171 U/L and alanineaminotransferase 173 U/L, mean serum albumin3.51±0.93 mg/dL, and median international normalized ratio 1.85.The mean total IgG level was 16.03 ±2.97 (normal 6 –16) g/L.Two patients were positive for antinuclear antibodies and none for anti-smooth muscle or anti-liver-kidney-microsomal antibodies.
Nonetheless, autoimmune hepatitis was unlikely in all patients afterexhaustive evaluation. A liver biopsy was performed in 6patients (percutaneous in 4 and transjugular in 2).Thefamilies of 2 patients did not consent to liver biopsy in viewof the critical nature of the illness, with both dying onfollow-up on best supportive care.The portal area was thecommonest site of inflammation, while the predominant type of inflammation was lym phocytic and eosinophilic.Interface hepatitis was not remarkable in the majority,while 50% had the presence of hepatocellular necrosis(spotty in 1, bridging in 1, and confluent in 2) ( Figure 2 ).In 1 patient (patient 3), a second (percutaneous) liver biopsy (details not shown in Table 2 ) was performed 5 months after the initial HILI presentation in view of therecurrence of hepatitis (without jaundice) after prior complete resolution.The initial biopsy was consistent with HILI.
Associated with severe canalicular andhepatocellular cholestasis with bridging necrosis with background NASH. Even though the histology did notfavor classical autoimmune hepatitis, the antinuclearantibody was positive with an elevated serum IgG.Therepeat biopsy revealed showed linear cores of livertissue forming vague nodules separated by fibroussepta.The hepatocytes showed microvesicular steatosis in close to 45% of cells.The portal tract revealed predominantly lymphocytic and clusteredmacrophage-mediated inflammation, mild to moderateinterface hepatitis with neutrophils and eosinophils, andminimal plasma cells.Necrotic areas (notable atbaseline biopsy) were absent, cholestasis hadresolved, and focal areas showed hepatocyte rosettes—these features were suggestive of chronic HILI with autoimmune-like features.Five types of ashwagandha formulations from the patients were subjected to chemical and toxicology analysis(marked with a “beaker icon ”inFigure 1 ).
None of the formulations revealed potential hepatotoxic contaminants,adulterants, or other synthetic agents. Herb-based naturalbioactive compounds were identified in all formulations,including glycosides, lactones, terpenes, saponins, and alkaloid groups.One product was additionally found to have trace amounts of lead (0.21 mg/kg), cadmium(0.038 mg/kg), and arsenic (0.089 mg/kg).DISCUSSION We report a series of patients with ashwagandha-related HILI from a multicenter retrospective cohort.The predominant pattern of liver injury was cholestatic, withjaundice as the notable clinical presentation.In our series,all patients underwent a thorough, exhaustive, andpragmatically detailed diagnostic evaluation to rule outother competing causes for acute liver injury.Thecommonest indication for ashwagandha use in our cohortwas for “stress and wellness.
”Three patients with ashwagandha-induced liver injury and underlying pre-existing liver disease in our cohort died with thedevelopment of ACLF, and 1 patient with chronic liverdisease and acute liver injury without ACLF survived. Inall other patients, ashwagandha-induced liver injury wasself-limiting with supportive care.Lymphocytic andeosinophilic portal-based inflammation with cholestasisand hepatocellular necrosis were predominant in histology.Ashwagandha is marketed as clinically beneficial for many conditions, including improvedexercise capacity and physical performance, increasedtestosterone, improved sleep, and reduced stress andanxiety.
However, the highest level of clinical evidencefrom available studies does not clarify these findings(Supplemental Table S1, http://links.lww.com/HC9/ A531 ), and hence the recommendation to use ashwagandha as a preventive or therapeutic modality does not exist in the current literature.6|HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS TABLE 2 Pertinent investigations of patients with ashwagandha-related liver injury Patient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Patient 4 Patient 5 Patient 6 Patient 7 Patient 8 Hemoglobin (g/L) 12.1 13.4 12.6 11.8 12 11.9 11 14.2 Total leukocyte count ( ×109/L)8.5 4.6 5.5 8.9 11.2 31 7.6 24.3 Platelet counts (×103perμL)148 234 180 215 192 80 112 157 Total bilirubin (mg/dL)10.4 2 3.6 21.3 16.1 11.4 24.3 31.5 Direct bilirubin (mg/dL)3.3 1 1.8 16.9 11.5 3.4 19.8 25.3 Aspartate aminotransferase(IU/L)107 598 647 64 235 47 100 270 Alanine aminotransferase(IU/L)66 736 409 159 188 97 63 354 Alkaline phosphatase(IU/L)105 241 199 354 893 59 128 209 Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (IU/L)709 118 268 342 213 178 223 Serum albumin (mg/dL)2.9 4.9 3.2 4.1 4.2 1.8 3.6 3.4 Serum globulin (mg/dL)4.3 2.6 3.7 2.2 2.8 5.4 2.6 3.7 International normalized ratio2.93 1 1.3 2.2 1 6.1 1.5 2.2 Serum total IgG (g/L) 14.8 17.2 20.2 16.4 11.5 18.6 17.2 12.4 Antinuclear antibody Negative Negative Positive Negative Negative Positive Negative Positive Anti-smooth muscle antibodyNegative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative Anti–liver-kidney- microsomal antibodyNegative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative R-ratio 1.3 5.6 5.3 1.3 0.6 4.9 1.5 5.1 Type of liver injury Cholestatic Hepatocellular Hepatocellular Cholestatic Cholestatic Mixed Cholestatic Hepatocellular RUCAM score 8, probable 6, probable 8, probable 7, probable 5, possible 5, possible 8, probable 7, probable HILI severity Severe Mild Moderate Severe Severe Severe Severe SevereASHWAGANDHA-INDUCED LIVER INJURY: A CASE SERIES |7 TABLE 2.

An exhaustive summary of all published reports on ashwagandha-induced liver injury is shown in Table 3 . The first report was from Japan, followed by multiplereports from United States, Germany, and Poland.Since the first report, a total of 14 cases (excluding thecurrent series) of ashwagandha-induced liver injury areavailable.[17–26]In the majority of the cases, there are many commonalities.The most common indication for ashwagandha use was stress and anxiety; young or middle-aged males predominated, and clinicalpresentation was jaundice with cholestasis in themajority.Most patients consumed the herb as perlabel instructions or as prescribed, and overdosing wasseen in only 1.[18]Liver biopsy revealed cholestasis with or without inflammation and sometimes necrosis.Thecausality assessment tool used was either RUCAM or an exhaustive diagnosis of exclusion.
Except for 1 patient who required liver transplantation for survival, allother cases improved with the best supportive care andmanagement of symptoms. In this context, our studyhas several commonalities and unique aspects.We present the current largest cohort of ashwagandha-related liver injuries from 3 participatingcenters that have maintained a DILI database capable of capturing such events.Our findings could only be the “tip of the iceberg ”and demonstrate that the nationwide burden of liver injury due to ashwagandha could bemore.The previous largest published series ofashwagandha-related liver injuries were from Icelandand the United States.DILI Network concerning 5patients.[17]Our series included only patients on pure ashwagandha-based formulations.
Patients consumingashwagandha as part of multiherbal preparations, like those included in the paper by Björnsson et al [17], were systematically excluded to remove the confoundingeffect of complex herbal preparations causing liverinjury. Our study included patients with pre-existing liverdisease, a novel aspect lacking in the current publishedliterature on ashwagandha-induced liver injury.Chronicliver disease patients developed more severe HILI, andall those who presented with the syndrome of ACLF died in our series, demonstrating the poor prognosis associated with disease severity and clinicalprogression noted with DILI in the cirrhosis population.In some cohorts, DILI in patients with underlying liverdisease has been associated with mortality rates ashigh as 16%, compared to ~5% in patients withoutpre-existing liver disease.[8,27,28 ]Most herbal FIGURE 2 Representative liver histology of patients with ashwagandha-induced liver injury.

Many cases of DILI due to herbal supplements are caused by formulations containing multi-ingredient mixtures, and it can be difficult to prove the exactcompound that is responsible for liver injury. [29]In our study, all patients used marketed or prescribed ashwa-gandha-only formulations, and chemical and toxicologyanalysis did not detect other hepatotoxic substances,making our conclusions on ashwagandha causingsevere liver injury and death among our patients pertinent and concerning.Although ashwagandha is generally considered safe to consume, there has beenan increase in reports of DILI due to its use, driven byunscientific and nonevidence-based promotion amonggeneral people through print, visual, and social media.The underlying mechanism for liver damage due toashwagandha could be the presence of herb-specificcompounds called withanolides that cause irreversible adduction to hepatocellular DNA.
[30]None of the patients had a history of concomitant hepatotoxicprescription or alternative medicine use, alcohol mis-use, or i.v. drug use.Even though we did not performthe PCR test for HCV and HEV infection, viral hepatitiswas considered very unlikely to cause the pattern ofliver injury described in our patient cohort, which waspredominantly cholestatic with only mild elevation in aminotransferases.Two patients in our cohort were positive for autoantibodies with high serum IgG withoutother classical features of autoimmune hepatitis.Initially, in all patients except those with severe ACLF,withdrawal of offending herb and supportive carewithout immunosuppression resolved jaundice andhepatitis.Unique to our study, we found that in 1patient, a young man (patient number 3), hepatitis recurred after complete resolution on best supportive care with repeat biopsy suggestive of chronic HILIwithout the presence of classical autoimmune hepatitis.
The second hepatitis episode was well controlled byinitiating low-dose immunosuppression (corticosteroids and mycophenolate), with the patient doing well on follow-up. Mild elevations of autoimmune markers arenot pathognomonic for autoimmune hepatitis and arevery commonly described in patients with DILI, anddrug-triggered autoimmune hepatitis is not uncommon,especially in the context of HILI.[7,9,17,31 ].Even though RUCAM is the standardized, validated tool to measurecausality in DILI, it tends to underestimate the causality associated with herbal supplements because it was designed to assess the causality of a single product,whereas herbal products typically contain multipleherbal and nonherbal ingredients.Nonetheless,published studies on single-ingredient herbal supple-ments have used RUCAM to approximate the causality,while others have only depended on an exhaustivediagnosis of exclusion without using any causality tools.
We understand that the newly developed Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method and the goldstandard DILIN consensus are better tools for causalityassessment. However, due to the retrospective natureof our study, we could not gather specific data inputs(such as exact dates of transaminase peak) required forRevised Electronic Causality Assessment Methodcompletion.The approximate days/duration (and not the date) of herb consumption and stoppage was from patient recall which may have suffered recall bias.Welack an organized, core DILI network in our country,there is a deficit of DILI coordinating centers, andpaucity of centralized expert-driven electronic/onlinedata assessment system for a rigorous and validatingconsensus which operates under DILIN in the UnitedStates.In our patients, the herbal supplement was a single ingredient (ashwagandha) without any other known hepatotoxic ingredients or concomitant liver toxicTABLE 3.

We could notretrieve all implicated products for exhaustive chemicalanalysis. But the chemical analysis of available samplesdid not reveal hepatotoxic components, contamination,or adulteration that could have indirectly led to liverinjury.Multiple prior studies have demonstrated a drug or herb-specific HLA association with DILI.In our study, we could not perform such testing due to a lack ofresources.A summary schematic encompassing pub-lished literature and novel findings from the currentstudy is shown in Supplemental Figure S2, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A532 .CONCLUSIONS Ashwagandha herb is used extensively in the Indian systems of traditional medicine, but lately, its use as adietary supplement for unproven indications has beenon the rise in western countries, especially for mentalhealth disorders and as a workout supplement amonggym-goers.
We present 8 cases of ashwagandha- related liver injury in which patients with pre-existing liver disease suffered high mortality without timely livertransplantation. Educating the public on avoidingunrecommended and potentially harmful herbal supple-ments can reduce the (avoidable) liver disease burdenwithin the community.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Cyriac A.Philips: conceptualiz ation, methodology, formal analysis, writing —original draft, writing —review and editing.Arun Valsan: conceptualization, data curation, writing — review and editing.Arif H.Theruvath: methodology, datacuration, writing —review and editing.Resmi Raveendran: methodology, data curation, writing —review and editing.Tharun T.Oommen: methodology, supervision, writing — review and editing.Sasidharan Rajesh: supervision, writing —review and editing.Saptarshi Bishnu: conceptualization, data curation, writing —review and editing.Philip Augustine: supervision, writing —review and editing.
