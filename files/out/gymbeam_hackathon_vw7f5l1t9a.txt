Kettegaards Alle 30, 2650 Hvidovre, Denmark (Received 23 September 2021 –Final revision received 4 February 2022 –Accepted 8 February 2022) Journal of Nutritional Science (2022), vol. 11, e19, page 1 of 8 doi:10.1017/jns.2022.18 Abstract In 2013, the Danish Health Authorities recommended a change in prophylactic iron supplementation to 40 –50 mg/d from gestational week 10.Hence, the aims of the present study were (1) to estimate the prevalence of women who follow the Danish recommendation on iron supplementation during the last 3weeks of the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and (2) to identify potential sociodemographic, reproductive and health-related pre-pregnancy predictors for iron supplementation during the ﬁrst trimester.We conducted a cross-sectional study with data from the hospital-based Copenhagen Pregnancy Cohort.
Characteristics were analysed by descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association s between pre- dictors and iron supplementation during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester. The study population consisted of 23 533 pregnant women attending ante- natal care at Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet from October 2013 to May 2019.The prevalence of iron supplementation according to recommendations was 49 ⋅1 %.The pre-pregnancy factors of ≥40 years of age, the educational level below a higher degree and a vegetarian or vegan diet were identi ﬁed as predictors for iron supplementation during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.Approximately half of the women were supplemented with the recommended dose of iron during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.We identi ﬁed pre-pregnancy predictors associated with iron supplementation.Interventions that target women of reproductive age are needed.
An enhanced focus on iron supplementation during pregnancy should be incorporated i n pre-pregnancy and interpregnancy counselling.

Hence, the maternal plasma volume increases by 40 –50 % during pregnancy(6).However, this process develops incom- mensurately with the erythrocyte mass, which only increasesby 25 % (6).
Therefore, women with low iron stores at concep- tion or women who do not meet the nutritional iron require- ment during pregnancy are at increased risk of developing irondeﬁciency (ID) (serum ferritin <15 μ/l) or iron de ﬁciency anaemia (IDA) (haemoglobin concentrations of <110 g/l and serum ferritin of <15 μ/l) (1,7). Globally, the prevalence of maternal anaemia varies vastly, mainly due to differences in nutritional status in low- and high- income countries(8).According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global prevalence of maternal anaemia during pregnancy is nearly 42 %, of which half is pre- sumed to be caused by ID(8).It is estimated that a body iron store of ≥500 mg in early pregnancy is required to complete a normal singleton pregnancy without iron supplementation(9).Nevertheless, a predominance of European women of repro-ductive age is estimated to have a body iron reserve of only 200 –300 mg (9), below the required to complete a pregnancy without ID or IDA.
In Europe, the average recommendeddaily dietary iron intake for women of reproductive age is 15 mg/d (10). However, a review of forty-nine studies from twenty-nine European countries showed that 61 –97 % of women of reproductive age had dietary iron intake below this recommendation.In Denmark, the dietary iron intake was only 9 ⋅7 mg/d(10).Furthermore, a review based on eleven European studies showed that the prevalence of ID and IDA was 28 –85 and 21 –35 % at 32 and 39 weeks of gestation, respectively, among pregnant women who did not take ironsupplements (7).The WHO(11)has established a global prophylactic iron rec- ommendation of 30 –60 mg/d throughout pregnancy depend- ing on the individual IDA prevalence in low- and high-income populations(11).As a result, recommendations are inconsistent around the world.Countries such as the UK and Australiaonly recommend iron supplementation for women who show symptoms of ID or IDA (12,13).
A Danish RCT found that 40 mg/d is enough to prevent ID or IDA in 90 and95 %, respectively, of all pregnancies in Denmark (14). Thus in 2013, the Danish Health Authorities changed their recom- mendation on prophylactic iron supplementation from 50 –70 mg/d from week 20 of pregnancy to 40 –50 mg/d from week 10, for the remaining duration of pregnancy (or week 18 at the latest if pregnancy nausea or vomiting preclude ironsupplementation) (15).To our knowledge, no Danish study has examined iron sup- plementation during the ﬁrst trimester since the revised national recommendation was implemented.However,previous studies have identi ﬁed maternal age, education, employment status, parity, degree of pregnancy planning, useof other food supplements and body mass index (BMI) as inﬂuencing factors on the intake of iron supplementation dur- ing pregnancy (16–19).
Therefore, it is important to highlight such predictors and evaluate whether pregnant women follow the national recommendation when changed to strengthen pre- conception and pregnancy counselling. Hence, the presentstudy ’s aims were (1) to estimate the prevalence of women who follow the Danish recommendation on iron supplementa- tion during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and (2) to identify potential sociodemographic, reproductive and health-related pre-pregnancy predictors for iron supplemen- tation during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester.Methods Design and study population We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Copenhagen Pregnancy Cohort.The cohort consisted of preg-nant women followed at the Department of Obstetrics at Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Denmark.
The hospital serves pregnant women living in the capital with-out known health-related risk factors and is a tertiary referral facility for the country ’s eastern region. In 2018, there were 5381 deliveries, equivalent to about 11 % of all deliveriesnationally (20).The Danish national prenatal screening programme offers all pregnant women a ﬁrst-trimester scan.The cohort was implemented on 16 September 2012.An email with a data link to a web-based clinical questionnaire consisting of twenty- ﬁve items with additional related sub-questions was automatically sent digitally to all women who had booked an appointment for a ﬁrst-trimester scan at the Obstetric Department.In Denmark, >90 % of all pregnant womenattend the ﬁrst-trimester ultrasound scan (21).After that, responses were transferred to their medical records for use during their antenatal care.
Subsequently, responses werealso stored in a clinical database for use in scienti ﬁc studies if approved by the National Health Authorities. On average, women from the Copenhagen Cohort responded to the clinicalquestionnaire at gestational week 10 ⋅2( SD2⋅1)(22).The ques- tionnaire was accessible in Danish and English and contained sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive and obstetrichistory, health status and health behaviour, including dietary behaviour.The data provided were subsequently transferred to the participant ’s medical records.From 16 September 2012 to 24 May 2019, a total of 33 465 women received the questionnaire.In the present study, we only used data from 1 October 2013 when the revised recom-mendation on iron supplementation during pregnancy was implemented.From 1 October 2013 to 24 May 2019, a total of 28 017 women received the questionnaire.
Women whohad a miscarriage ( n1116), moved to another borough ( n27), or were transferred to another birth facility ( n151), were excluded from the study leaving an eligible study populationof 26 723. Out of these, 24 203 responded to the clinical 2journals.cambridge.org/jns questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 90 ⋅6 %.Of the completed questionnaires, 328 women had not answered the question on iron supplementation, and a further 342 had miss- ing information on the gestational week, so these were alsoexcluded.This resulted in a ﬁnal study population of 23 533 pregnant women ( Fig.1 ).Study variables In the category of food supplements, the speci ﬁc question of interest on prophylactic iron supplementation was phrased as ‘Do you currently take a daily iron supplement of at least 40–50 mg?’The question could be answered as yes or no.For the present study, we de ﬁned women who answered yes as‘users of iron ’and women who answered no as ‘non-users ’.
Additionally, the following variables on maternal characteris- tics were extracted from the questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics included maternal age (<25, 25 –29, 30 –34, 35–39 and ≥40 years), highest obtained educational level (com- pulsory education, technical degree, short degree (1 –2 years),intermediate degree (3 –4 years) or higher degree), employment status (employed, unemployed, student or other) and cohabitingwith a partner/spouse (no/yes).Danish language skills were evaluated with the ability to read and understand Danish (no/yes).Reproductive history included parity (nulliparous or multip- arous), degree of pregnancy planning, evaluated by using the Swedish Pregnancy Planning Scale (23)(high degree of preg- nancy planning, neither planned nor unplanned, low degree of pregnancy planning), method of conception [spontaneous or assisted reproductive technology (ART)] and previousmiscarriages (no/yes).
Information on health status included chronic conditions (no/yes). The women could tick ‘yes’for the following con- ditions at the time of pregnancy: high blood pressure, lung disease, diabetes type 1 or 2, metabolic disorder, arthritis, epi- lepsy, mental illness, heart disease, migraine or other diseases,or ‘no, I did not suffer from any diseases ’.They were not asked about prior conditions with IDA.Health behaviour fac- tors before pregnancy included pre-pregnancy BMI [calculatedfrom weight and height and grouped according to the WHO recommendations (24)as underweight (BMI: <18 ⋅5 kg/m2), average weight (BMI: 18 ⋅5–24⋅9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI: 25–29⋅99 kg/m2) and obese (BMI: ≥30 kg/m2)], smoking sta- tus before pregnancy (no/yes) and exercise before pregnancy deﬁned as ≥3⋅5 h/week (no/yes) corresponding to the Danish Health Authority ’s recommendation(25).
Finally, the questionnaire also yielded information on dietary behaviour during pregnancy (ordinary varied, ordinary not varied andvegetarian or vegan) and the dietary supplement folic acid intake, including pregnancy multivitamins containing folic acid (no/yes) at the time of conception. Statistical analysis We calculated the prevalence in number ( n) and percentage (%) of iron supplementation for users and non-users and ana- lysed the characteristics of the study population through descriptive statistics.We used generalised estimating equationsto account for women with more than one pregnancy in the cohort.To examine the association between potential predic- tors and the intake of prophylactic iron supplementation dur- ing the ﬁrst trimester, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed and presented as crudeodds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CI).
The sociodemographic variables maternal age and education, reproductive history, parity andhealth behaviour variable BMI have previously been deter- mined as predictors for iron supplementation in comparable studies (16–18). These were therefore included in the multivari- able logistic regression analysis as potential pre-pregnancy pre- dictors.In addition, we hypothesised that the health behaviour variables folic acid supplementation at the time of conception,dietary behaviour during pregnancy, exercise before pregnancy and smoking before pregnancy could be potential pre- pregnancy health behaviour predictors for iron supplementa-tion as they have previously been determined as predictors for iron intake during pregnancy (16,19).The variable dietary Fig.1.Flowchart of the study population.3journals.cambridge.org/jns behaviour comprised diet during pregnancy in the clinical questionnaire.
However, previous studies have estimated thata predominance of pregnant women does not change their dietary behaviour regarding enhancing food intake that contri- butes to important nutrients essential for the development of anormal pregnancy (26,27). This variable was therefore also hypothesised as a potential pre-pregnancy health behaviour predictor and included in the analysis.We checked for inter-action effects between co-variates in the regression model and found no evidence to support this.Also, the assumptions for the multivariable logistic regression model were checkedbefore performing analysis, and no evidence for a violation of the assumptions was found.A two-sided P<0⋅05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS (IBM Statistics SPSS version 25).
Results Iron supplementation during the first trimester of pregnancy In the present study, the prevalence of iron supplementation of 40 –50 mg/d was 49 ⋅1 % (95 % CI 48 ⋅5, 49 ⋅8) (n11 559) during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester. Maternal characteristics of the study population The overall maternal characteristics of the study population (n23 533) in relation to iron supplementation are presented inTable 1 .The majority of the study population was between 30 and 34 years of age (39 ⋅9 %) with a mean age of 32 years (SD4⋅4), had a higher degree (53 ⋅5 %), were employed (72 ⋅9% ) , living with a partner (91 ⋅8 %), and were able to read and understand Danish (94 ⋅5 %).A predominance was nulliparous (62⋅7 %) and had conceived spontaneously (86 ⋅8 %), had a high degree of pregnancy planning (74 ⋅4 %) and had no previ- ous miscarriages (73 ⋅4 %).
Mostly, the women had a normal BMI (18 ⋅5–24⋅9 kg/m2) (73 ⋅2 %) and were non-smokers before current pregnancy (87 ⋅6 %), as well as exercised ≥3⋅5 h/week (57 ⋅8 %) before their pregnancy. Generally, the women reported to have an ordinary, varied diet (78 ⋅9% ) and had taken folic acid supplementation at the time of con- ception (55 %).A considerable part of the population reportedhaving a chronic condition (22 ⋅4% )( Table 1 ).Predictors for iron supplementation during the first trimester of pregnancy Results from the multivariable logistic regression analyses are shown in Table 2 .Data from 23 533 women were included in the analyses, of which 5469 women contributed to thestudy with two to four pregnancies.The following predictors were identi ﬁed in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.
In the sociodemographic category, women who were ≥40 years of age had 17 % higher odds (aOR: 1 ⋅17; 95 % CI: 1⋅02, 1 ⋅35) of being users of iron supplementation during theﬁrst trimester compared with women who were 30 –34 years of age.

The present study was the ﬁrst to estimate the prevalence of iron supplementation after a change in the national recommendation for iron supple- mentation introduced in October 2013.
Pre-pregnancy predic- tors for adherence to the national recommendation for ironsupplementation were higher maternal age, an educational levelbelow a higher degree and a vegetarian or vegan diet. In the present study, this prevalence of 49 ⋅1 % for iron sup- plementation during the ﬁrst trimester differed from a prior Danish study from 2007 ( n50 902) (16).This previous study showed that only 9 ⋅9 % of the women had an intake of iron supplementation of 50 –70 mg/d, which corresponded to the previous Danish recommendations on iron supplementationduring pregnancy (16).However, the same study found that 77⋅2 % of the study population were users of iron supplemen- tation at any time between early pregnancy and gestational week 30.However, the daily iron dose ranged between 1 and >101 mg(16).A lack of uniformity may explain the wide range in iron doses at the time in iron brands marketed topregnant women (16).
Several brands contained 100 mg, which may have resulted in the women not being aware thattheir iron supplement of choice exceeded the recommendediron dose of 50 –70 mg/d. Therefore, it is dif ﬁcult to compare the study results on iron supplementation during pregnancy.Previous studies that have examined iron supplementation during pregnancy in Finland (18), Germany(19)and Austria(28) found an overall prevalence between 65 ⋅2 and 68 ⋅3% o f iron supplementation during pregnancy(18,19,28).In addition, a French study reported an increasing prevalence of iron sup- plementation from only 18 ⋅5 % in the ﬁrst trimester to 63 ⋅9% in the third trimester(17).H o w e v e r ,a l t h o u g ht h es t u d yr e s u l t so n prevalence are similar, a comparison should be made with cau-tion as none of these countries recommend prophylactic iron supplementation during pregnancy.
The lack of international consensus is apparent as the previous studies have examined any form and dose of iron supplementation during preg- nancy (17–19,28). This may signify that generalisation between global study populations regarding iron supplementation is not feasible.Therefore, individual study results should be inter-preted in the context of the local, national recommendations.We aimed to identify pre-pregnancy predictors for iron sup- plementation during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester.We found that advanced age was a predictor for iron supplemen-tation as women ≥40 years of age had 17 % higher odds of being users of iron supplementation during the ﬁrst trimester.This is in line with previous studies that found the same asso- ciation between higher age and an increased likelihood of iron supplementation throughout pregnancy (16–18).
Surprisingly, women with all levels of education below a higher degree had higher odds of being users of iron supple- mentation during the ﬁrst trimester. This result contrasts with previous studies that found that pregnant women with the highest obtained educational level were more likely to be iron users(16,18).We cannot preclude that our ﬁnding wasone of chance as none of the associations were strong, and there was not a pattern of a stronger adherence to the iron rec-ommendation as the educational level decreased.Previous studies that have examined adherence to recommendations on exercise (29)and smoking(30)during pregnancy found that women with a higher educational level were more likely to adhere to national recommendations regarding exercise and smoking cessation during pregnancy(29,30).
Also, a previous Danish study examining health literacy in the general Danish population found that people with a higher educational level had a better ability to understand health information andtherefore had a healthier lifestyle than people with a lower edu- cational level (31). Therefore, it is noteworthy that women with a higher degree in the present study had lower odds of beingusers of iron supplementation during the ﬁrst trimester.However, as the CPC population on average responded to the clinical questionnaire at gestational week 10 ⋅2 (22), a possible explanation could be that the women with a higher degree may have been aware of the Danish Health Authorities recommen- dation to postpone iron supplementation until gestationalweek 18 if they suffered from pregnancy symptoms as nausea or vomiting (15), compared with women with a lower educa- tional level.
Yet, the present results suggest that promotingiron supplementation in clinical practice should be targeted at all educational levels in pregnant women. Finally, the present study showed that pregnant women who had a vegetarian or vegan diet had 18 % higher odds of being users of iron supplementation during the ﬁrst trimester than women with an ordinary, varied diet.This is in line with a pre-vious German study that found that pregnant women with a vegetarian diet were more likely to use iron supplementation during pregnancy (19).However, only 6 ⋅3 % reported having a vegetarian or vegan diet in the present study, while 9 ⋅6 % reported having an ordinary, not varied diet.
It is noteworthy that women with an ordinary, not varied diet were less likely to be users of ironsupplementation during pregnancy, as it previously has been estab- lished that a majority of European women of reproductive age have a suboptimal dietary intake of iron (10)and that women with an unvaried diet are known to have an increased risk of developing ID or IDA(26). Therefore, a heightened focus on diet- ary behaviour for this group of pregnant women during precon-ception and pregnancy counselling may be needed.A st h ep r e s e n ts t u d yi d e n t i ﬁed maternal age, education and dietary behaviour as pre-pregnancy predictors for iron supple-mentation during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester, results may indicate a general need for an increased focus on preconcep- tion care and pregnancy counselling regarding the importance ofiron supplementation during pregnancy.Preconception counsel- ling has especially gained an increased focus in recent years (32).
Poor nutritional status in the preconception period has beenassociated with adverse maternal and foetal outcomes and in ﬂu- ences future maternal and child health (32–34). As the majority of European women of reproductive age have iron levels belowwhat is required to complete a normal pregnancy without develop- ing ID or IDA (9), preconception counselling targeting all women of reproductive age has the potential to heighten the knowledge ofthe importance of improved nutritional status before pregnancy and thereby also iron supplementation during pregnancy.6journals.cambridge.org/jns In the present study, three out of four women in the popu- lation reported having a high degree of pregnancy planning.Yet, the present study found that only 49 ⋅1 % of the popula- tion were users of iron supplementation during the ﬁrst trimester despite the Danish recommendation for iron supple-mentation during pregnancy.
This may re ﬂect a need to strengthen health counselling before pregnancy, and precon- ception counselling for women actively planning for theirﬁrst pregnancy could be a window of opportunity when they are more likely to seek information and are more open to changes in health behaviour (35). Nevertheless, incorporating such counselling into current healthcare efforts in connection with women planning their ﬁrst pregnancy and unplanned pregnancies has proven dif ﬁcult(35), and further research on the subject is needed.A heightened focus on interpregnancy counselling may be an important opportunity to reduce the risk of developing ID or IDA in future pregnancies as thesewomen are already in contact with healthcare providers.Strengths and limitations A notable strength of the study is the large sample size.In Denmark, all pregnant women are offered a ﬁrst-trimester scan, and in 2017 approximately 92 % accepted this offer(36).
All pregnant women who booked an appointment for a ﬁrst- trimester scan at the Department of Obstetrics were eligible to participate and were therefore invited to answer the clinicalquestionnaire. The study had a high response rate, which, combined with the large sample size, was representative of all pregnant women at the birth facility and reduced the riskof selection bias.However, a risk of selection bias is present as the study only included data from one birth facility.Compared with a previous Danish study on iron supplemen-tation (16), the clinical questionnaire was also available in English which meant that we were able to include more of the 4 ⋅5 % of the study population who did not master the Danish language, making the study population more represen- tative and increasing external validity.Nevertheless, as the clinical questionnaire was only available in these two languages, we may have been unaware of women unable to provide data due to linguistic challenges.
Also, it may not be possible to refer to the results as representative of all pregnant women in Denmark. The study population predom- inately consisted of urban women who were well educated andreported data indicating a generally healthy lifestyle.The risk of recall bias was minimised as the data was obtained during early pregnancy around the gestational age, where the DanishHealth Authorities recommend that pregnant women com- mence iron supplementation (15).The study has further limitations which need to be addressed.The risk of reporting bias must be acknowledged as data from the clinical questionnaire were self-reported.A potential overestimation of the results must be recognised,as some women may have been aware of the national recom- mendation and thus untruthfully answered yes to the clinical question on iron supplementation.
Moreover, the clinical ques-tionnaire only yielded an arbitrary assessment of dietary intake of iron based on diet status, as a detailed analysis was notincluded in the present study. Future studies could include more extensive and detailed questions on the subject, includ-ing questions on prior conditions with ID.Furthermore, the question on iron supplementation was not validated, which increased the risk of information bias.Hence,the study results may not represent an adequate answer to why the overall prevalence of iron supplementation during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester was 49 ⋅1 %.In addition, as the study population only answered the clinical questionnaire once during early pregnancy, it was not possible to assess iron supplementation intake throughout pregnancy.We were,therefore, unable to assess whether the prevalence remained unchanged throughout the second and third trimesters.
However, in previous studies (16,17), an increase in prevalence has been observed, and we hypothesise that the same tendency could be seen in our study population. Implications The present study identi ﬁed pre-pregnancy predictors asso- ciated with the intake of iron supplementation during the last 3 weeks of the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.Despite the recommendation of commencing iron supplementation from gestational week 10, under half of the study population were users of iron supplementation during the last 3 weeks of theﬁrst trimester.The study, therefore, elucidates the need for an increased focus on the importance of iron supplementation during pregnancy and pregnancy counselling.However, ourﬁndings also suggest that the potential risk of developing ID or IDA during pregnancy needs to be addressed before con- ception, and preconception counselling interventions targetedat all women of reproductive age are required.
In addition, as prophylactic iron supplementation during pregnancy is still a subject of international disagreement (11–13), further research to examine the effect on ID and IDA in pregnant women should be undertaken. Conclusion Despite a high degree of pregnancy planning, the prevalence of self-reported iron supplementation during the last 3 weeks oftheﬁrst trimester was approximately 50 % in the present Copenhagen Pregnancy Cohort.The present study found that the pre-pregnancy factors of advanced age, an educationallevel below a higher degree and having a vegetarian or vegan diet were predictors for the intake of iron supplementation during early pregnancy.Future studies examining the intakeof iron supplementation throughout pregnancy are needed.Ourﬁndings indicate that the change of national recommen- dation on iron supplementation has not yet been fully beentaken aboard by pregnant women.
Therefore, there is a need for an enhanced focus on the importance of iron supplemen- tation during pregnancy to be incorporated in preconceptioncare and pregnancy and interpregnancy counselling.
