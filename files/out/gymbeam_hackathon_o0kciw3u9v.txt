Objective: To investigate vitamin B-6 and riboflavin status, their metabolic interaction, and relationship with methylenetetrahydrofo-late reductase ( MTHFR) genotype in adulthood. Methods: Data from 5612 adults aged 18–102 y were drawn from the Irish National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) and the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA) and Genovit cohorts (volunteer samples).Plasma PLP and erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac), asa functional indicator of riboflavin, were determined.Results:Older ( ≥65 y) compared with younger ( <65 y) adults had significantly lower PLP concentrations ( P<0.001).A stepwise decrease in plasma PLP was observed across riboflavin categories, fromoptimal(EGRac ≤1.26),tosuboptimal(EGRac:1.27–1.39),to deficient (EGRac ≥1.40) status, an effect most pronounced in older adults(mean ±SEM:76.4 ±0.9vs65.0 ±1.1vs55.4 ±1.2nmol/L; P<0.001).
In individuals with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype combined with riboflavin deficiency, compared with non-TT (CC/CT) genotype participants with sufficient riboflavin, we observed PLP concentrations of 52.1 ±2.9 compared with 76.8±0.7nmol/L( P<0.001).Inparticipantswithavailabledietary data (i.e., NANS cohort, n=936), PLP was associated with vitamin B-6 intake (nonstandardized regression coefficient β: 2.49; 95% CI 1.75, 3.24; P<0.001), supplement use ( β: 81.72; 95% CI: 66.01, 97.43; P<0.001), fortified food ( β: 12.49; 95% CI: 2.08, 22.91; P=0.019), and EGRac ( β: –65.81; 95% CI: –99.08, –32.54; P<0.001), along with BMI ( β: –1.81; 95% CI: –3.31, –0.30; P=0.019).Conclusions: Theseresultsareconsistentwiththeknownmetabolic dependency of PLP on flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and suggest that riboflavin may be the limiting nutrient for maintaining vitamin B-6 status, particularly in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype.
Randomized trials are necessary to investigate the PLP response to riboflavin intervention within the dietary range.

Compared with the roles of folate and vitamin B-12 within this network, the metabolic and health effects of vitamin B-6 and riboflavin deficiency are much less well investigated in populations globally. Riboflavin status, in particular, is rarely assessed at a population level, but the limited available evidencesuggests that deficiency may be more widespread than generally appreciated, including in high-income countries ( 1).Am J Clin Nutr 2022;116:1767–1778.Printed in USA.©The Author(s) 2022.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/ 4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.1767 1768 Jarrett et al.
Riboflavin in its cofactor forms, FMN and FAD, is involved in the metabolism of energy, drugs, toxins, and other nutrients, including folate and vitamin B-6. The functional biomarker, erythrocyteglutathionereductaseactivationcoefficient(EGRac),is used to assess riboflavin status, with higher values indicative of low or deficient status ( 2).The metabolically active form of vitamin B-6, pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP), acts as a cofactor for enzymes required in multiple metabolic reactions ( 3,4) and plasma PLP is the most commonly used biomarker for assessingvitaminB-6status( 5).Theidentificationofmodifiable factors that influence vitamin B-6 is important, considering that low plasma PLP is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease ( 6,7), cancers ( 8–11), neurodegenerative diseases,cognitiveimpairment,anxiety,anddepression( 12–15), and appears to predict all-cause mortality ( 16).
Very few human studies have investigated the important metabolicinteractionbetweenriboflavinandvitaminB-6.Specif- ically,pyridoxine5′-phosphateoxidase(PPO)requiresriboflavin in the cofactor form of FMN for the deamination of pyridoxine5 ′-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate to generate PLP (17). Animal studies indicate that PPO activity is sensitive to changes in riboflavin intake ( 18), with low PLP concentrations reported under conditions of riboflavin deficiency ( 19).In humans, consistent with its role in vitamin B-6 metabolism, our small intervention trial showed that riboflavin supplementationresulted in not only improved status of riboflavin (EGRac) but alsoincreasedplasmaPLPinolderadultswithlowstatusofeither vitamin at baseline ( 20).
Much more recently, we reported that riboflavin was significantly associated with PLP concentrationsin healthy adults ( 21); the study was small, however, limiting the generalizability of our observations and extent to which the interrelationship of these nutrients could be investigated. More-over, in other studies, we reported that riboflavin has a particular roleinmaintainingone-carbonmetabolism,specificallyinadults homozygous for the common C677T polymorphism in the gene This study was completed as part of the DERiVE project, awarded under the Joint Programming Initiative a Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life(JPI-HDHL) scheme for transnational research under the “Biomarkers forNutrition and Health” scheme: UK–Biotechnology and Biological SciencesResearch Council (BBSRC, grant ref: BB/P028241/1).

The primary aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate theassociationbetweenbiomarkersofvitaminB-6andriboflavin status, and the interactive effect of MTHFRgenotype, using data fromlargeadultcohorts.Inaddition,thedeterminantsofvitamin-B6 and riboflavin biomarkers were examined as a secondary outcome among participants with available dietary intake data. Methods Recruitment and study design Data for this study were drawn from 3 cohorts: the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) of Ireland, the Trinity-UlsterDepartmentofAgriculture(TUDA)cohortstudy,andtheGenovit case-control study ( 24).NANS is a nationally representative sample of Irish adults, with detailed dietary, nutritional status,andhealthandlifestyledatacollectedduringtheperiodof2008– 2010.Eligible participants were healthy adults, not pregnant or breastfeeding.
Full sampling and methodological details forNANShavebeenreportedpreviously( 25).Asdescribedindetail elsewhere ( 26), the TUDA study comprises a cross-sectional cohort of 5186 older adults ( ≥60 y), with the primary aim of investigating nutritional factors in the development of chronic diseases of aging. Eligible participants were noninstitutionalized adults born on the island of Ireland.Participants were recruitedduring the period of 2008–2012 using standardized protocols, from general practitioner practices in the Northern and Western Trusts in Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) and from hospitaloutpatient clinics at the Department of Medicine for the Elderly at St.James’s Hospital Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.TheGenovitstudyincludedpatientswithcardiovasculardisease recruited in 2003–2005 from the Cardiology Unit at AltnagelvinAreaHospital,WesternHealthandSocialCareTrust, Northern Ireland, and apparently healthy, age- and sex-matchedcontrols.
Ethical approval for TUDA and Genovit were obtained from the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (reference number: TUDA, 08/NIR03/113, and Genovit,08/NIR03/40) and/or from the Research Ethics Committee in St James’s Hospital, and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin.EthicalapprovalforNANSwasobtainedfromUniversityCollege Cork Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals and the Human Ethics Research Committee of University College Dublin [ECM 3 (p)], and all participantsprovided written informed consent at the time of recruitment. Dietary, lifestyle, and anthropometric data For all study cohorts, health and lifestyle information was ob- tainedinface-to-faceinterviewsconductedbytrainedresearchers using standardized protocols.Specifically, a comprehensive health and lifestyle questionnaire was administered to capturemedical and demographic details, medications, and vitamin supplement usage.

Briefly, food and beverage intake datawererecordedusinga4-consecutive-daysemi-weighedfood diary that included at least 1 weekend day. Participants wereasked to record the type and amount of all food, beverages, andsupplements consumed and, where applicable, record recipes, cooking method, and details of leftover food.Food intake data were analyzed using the food-composition database WeighedIntakeSoftwarePackage(WISP)version3.0(TinuvielSoftware) that uses data from McCance and Widdowson’s “The Compo- sition of Foods” sixth and fifth editions plus all 9 supplementalvolumes to generate nutrient intake.Adjustments were made to thefood-compositiondatabasetoaccountfor recipes,nutritional supplements, commonly consumed generic Irish foods, and newfoods on the market.
Blood sampling and laboratory analysis Blood samples collected at the time of the appointment were analyzedforroutineclinicalmeasurements,includingcreatinine,triglycerides,HDLcholesterol,LDLcholesterol,high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and hemoglobin in the participating locallaboratories.B-vitaminstatusbiomarkersacrossallcohortswere analyzed centrally in specialist research laboratories at Ulster University or Trinity College Dublin using standardized procedures. PLP concentrations were measured as a biomarker of vitamin B-6 status as described in detail previously ( 27).Briefly, the method involved protein precipitation by trichloroacetic acidfor release of PLP bound to protein, followed by conversion of PLP to 4-pyridoxic acid phosphate with cyanide in alkaline medium, acidification, separation by HPLC, and quantitation bya sensitive fluorescence detector.
Despite a lack of consensus regarding cutoffs to define adequate vitamin B-6 status, plasma PLP concentrations <20.0 nmol/L and between 20.0 and 30.0 nmol/L are generally considered deficient and suboptimal, respectively ( 5). The latter cutoff was based on a controlleddietary intervention trial among healthy young adults, in which PLP values <30 nmol/L were associated with a wide range of metabolic effects, including perturbations of amino acid, lipid,and organic acid profiles in plasma ( 28).EGRac was assessed as a functional marker of riboflavin status ( 2) and represents the enzyme activity ratio for stimulated versus unstimulatedglutathione reductase before and after in vitro activation with itsprosthetic group, FAD.A higher EGRac ratio indicates lower riboflavin status.
Although there are no universally accepted EGRac cutoffs to define optimal or low status ( 1), a coefficient of≥1.40 was recently adopted to identify deficient riboflavin status as this is the cutoff generally used to denote deficiency in the few studies reporting this biomarker ( 29). Furthermore, in the absence of more robust evidence, a coefficient of ≤1.26 was adopted to define “optimal” riboflavin status based on the 95th percentile of the distribution of EGRac values measuredin our previous study ( 30) after a 16-wk intervention with low-dose riboflavin (1.6 mg/d), an amount within the range of typical dietary intakes of riboflavin.In turn, an EGRac valuebetween 1.27 and 1.39 was used to define suboptimal riboflavin status.RBCfolatewasmeasuredbymicrobiologicalassayusing Lactobacillus casei and serum total vitamin B-12 was also mea- sured by microbiological assay using Lactobacillus leichmanni .Plasmahomocysteinewasmeasuredbyfluorescencepolarization immunoassay.
Samples were analyzed blind. In the case of PLP, certified plasma controls at 2 different PLP concentrations (29.7 and 89.0 nmol/L; Chromsystems) were used.There is no commer-ciallyavailablequalitycontrolforRBCglutathionereductase(for riboflavin); therefore, stored in-house batches of pooled washed RBCs were used (2 aliquots for every run of 24 samples).Intra-assay and interassay CVs were ≤4.1% for plasma PLP and ≤4.5% for EGRac.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Pack- age for the Social Sciences software (SPSS) (version 25.0; SPSS UK Ltd.).Before statistical analysis, tests for normality 1770 Jarrett et al.

Analysis of the NANS cohort for intake-status relationships was conducted with and without the inclusion of supplementusers. Participantcharacteristicswerecomparedbetweenagegroups (<6 5yv s .≥65 y) by ANCOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests, with adjustment for cohort, whereas categorical variables were assessedusingchi-squareanalysis.Theassociationsbetweenage decilesandriboflavinandvitaminB-6statuswereassessedusingthe Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend.A 1-factor ANOVA with Scheffé post hoc tests was used to assess the impact of age on intake and biomarker status of vitamin B-6 and riboflavinin both males and females.Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the determinants of plasma PLP concentrations and EGRac.B-vitamin supplement use, dietaryintakes of the respective vitamin, fortified food consumption, age, sex, BMI, alcohol intake, smoking, serum creatinine, serum CRP, hemoglobin, and muscle mass were considered asindependent variables.
For plasma PLP concentration, EGRacand energy intake were additionally included in the model, whereas for EGRac, milk consumption was also included. The relations among dietary and biomarker variables wereexamined in the 2 separate age groups ( <6 5ya n d ≥65 y), first with non–B-vitamin supplement users and then with B-vitamin supplement users included, by using Pearson partial correlationcoefficients, controlling for age.ANCOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was conducted in separate age and sex categories to investigate whether plasma PLP concentrations differed byriboflavinbiomarkerstatusgroupsasdefinedabove(i.e.,optimal, suboptimal, and deficient), after adjusting for age, BMI, and smoking status.Results Vitamin B-6 and riboflavin status and their association inhealthy adults Identification of the sample for analysis from the 3 ob- servational cohorts is illustrated in Figure 1 .The general characteristics of the study population are described in Table 1.

Compared with the CC/CT-sufficient riboflavin status as the reference category (76.8±0.7), PLP concentrations (nanomoles/liter) were lowest (52.1 ±2.87) in those with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype combined with riboflavin deficiency ( P<0.001), but not significantly lower in the TT-sufficient riboflavin category (P=0.704).Supplemental Figure 1 shows plasma PLP con- centrations stratified by MTHFRgenotype in optimal compared with suboptimal riboflavin status.
Dietary intake and status of vitamin B-6 and riboflavin—NANS cohort Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with the biomarkers of vitamin B-6 and riboflavin status in a subset of participants with available dietary intake data (i.e., NANS only and included supplementusers) (Table 2). Plasma PLP concentrations were significantly associated with B-vitamin supplement use, dietary vitamin B-6 intake, fortified food consumption, BMI, and EGRac ( Table 2).Age was also a significant determinant of vitamin B-6 status but only in non–supplement users (results not shown).ForEGRac (Table 2), B-vitamin supplement use, dietary riboflavin intake, fortified food, milk consumption, age, smoking sta- tus, and hemoglobin were strongly associated with riboflavinstatus.Intake and biomarker status of each B-vitamin were then compared across 3 age categories—18–50 y, 51–64 y, and ≥65 y—in males and females.
Consistent with the data presented inFigure 2, males aged ≥65 y had significantly lower plasma PLP concentrations compared with males in the youngestage group (18–50 y) ( P<0.001), whereas there were no significantdifferencesacrossagegroupsforfemales( P=0.377). There were no differences among dietary vitamin B-6 intakesacross the 3 age categories for either males ( P=0.112) or females ( P=0.430).Riboflavin status was better in older females aged ≥65 y compared with females in the youngest age group (18–50 y) ( P=0.003), whereas there were no significant differences in riboflavin status across the age groups for males ( P=0.105).Corresponding dietary riboflavin intakes were significantly higher for males in the youngest age groupcomparedwithmalesinthe2olderagegroups(51–64yand ≥65 y) (P<0.001).There were no significant differences in dietary riboflavin intakes for females ( P= 0.393) (Table 3).
In the NANS participants who did not use B-vitamin supplements the relationship between reported dietary intake of each B-vitamin and the corresponding status was examined.Strong correlations between dietary intake and status of vitamin Interaction of vitamin B-6 and riboflavin 1773 4550556065707580 CC/CT-sufficient riboflavinCC/CT-deficient riboflavinTT-sufficient riboflavinTT-deficient riboflavin)L/lomn( PLP amsalP MTHFR genotype-riboflavin status categoryP < 0.001P = 0.704 P < 0.001 (n3230) ( n 1546) ( n 487) ( n 208) FIGURE4 PlasmaPLPconcentrationsstratifiedby MTHFRgenotypeinparticipantswithsufficientvs.deficientriboflavinstatus.Riboflavinstatusdefined assufficient(EGRac <1.40)anddeficient(EGRac ≥1.40).

Similarly, the association between riboflavin intake and EGRac strengthened with the inclusionofB-vitaminsupplementusersinyounger( r=–0.292, P<0.001 vs. r=–0.303, P<0.001) and older adults ( r= –0.182, P<0.044 vs.r=–0.329, P<0.001) (results not shown).Discussion I nas a m p l eo f >5000 adults aged 18–102 y drawn from 3 observational cohorts, we show that plasma PLP is stronglyassociatedwithriboflavinstatusthroughoutadulthood,consistent with the known metabolic interaction between these 2 nutrients.In this large sample, PLP concentrations were found to decreasein a stepwise manner from optimal to suboptimal to deficient ri- boflavin status.Furthermore, the MTHFRC677T polymorphism interacted with riboflavin to influence PLP, in that the lowestPLP concentrations were found in individuals with riboflavin deficiency combined with the variant TT genotype.
The current results provide evidence of the metabolic depen- dencyofPLPonFMNandarebroadlyconsistentwiththelimited previous human studies that exist ( 20,21,31,32). We foundthatplasmaPLPwas24-nmol/Llowerinparticipantscategorized as having deficient compared with optimal riboflavin status, an observation that is entirely consistent with a trial we conductedsome years ago, which showed an increase in plasma PLP by24 nmol/L in response to riboflavin supplementation of older adults with baseline concentrations of PLP indicative of vitamin B-6deficiency( 20).Likewise,inaconveniencesampleofhealthy adults, we recently observed a strong association of EGRac with PLPconcentrations( 21).Thehumanevidenceisinlinewithearly animal studies demonstrating low PLP concentrations in rats feda riboflavin-deficient diet ( 19) and responses in PPO activity to changes in riboflavin intake ( 18).
The current finding of low PLP concentrations among those with deficient riboflavin status,independent of dietary vitamin B-6 intake, adds considerably to ourearlierobservational( 21)andtrial( 20)findings.Furthermore, although previous studies have reported significant associationsbetween vitamin B-6 intake and plasma PLP ( 33–35), here we showed that vitamin B-6 status declines with age across adulthood,particularlyinmales.ConsistentwithUKpopulation–based data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (36), mean PLP concentrations were >30 nmol/L higher in younger compared with older males ( 36).
Similarly, low plasma PLPhasbeenreportedinnonsupplementedolderUSmalesinthe NHANES( n=4463)(33,37).Theexplanationforlowervitamin B-6 status in older males is unclear, given that dietary intakeswereverysimilartothoseinyoungermales,butcouldberelated to increased vitamin -B6 catabolism due to low-grade chronic inflammatory processes associated with aging ( 38) or decreased protein binding capacity of plasma, leading to increases in free PLP (5). The decline in PLP concentrations with age was less pronounced in females, consistent with previous reports of sex-specific differences in plasma PLP trajectories with age ( 33,37).1774 Jarrett et al.

Multiple linear regression analyses were performed using plasma PLP concentration and EGRac as dependent variables, respectively, using data from the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) of Irish adults. In the plasmaPLP model, B-vitamin supplement use (nonconsumers of B-vitamin supplements as reference category), dietaryvitamin B-6 intake (mg/d), fortified food consumer (nonconsumers and lowest tertile of vitamin B-6 intake fromfortified foods as reference category), age (y), sex (male as reference category), BMI (kg/m 2), alcohol intake (units/wk), smoking (nonsmoker as reference category), serum creatinine ( μmol/L), hsCRP ( μmol/L), hemoglobin (g/dL, muscle mass (kg), and EGRac were included in the model as independent variables.
In the riboflavin model,B-vitamin supplement use (nonconsumers of B-vitamin supplements as reference category), dietary riboflavin intake(mg/d), fortified food consumer (nonconsumers and lowest tertile of riboflavin intake from fortified foods as referencecategory), milk consumption (lowest quartile of milk intake as reference category) age (y), sex (male as referencecategory), BMI (kg/m 2), alcohol intake (units/wk), smoking (nonsmoker as reference category), serum creatinine (μmol/L), hsCRP ( μmol/L), hemoglobin (g/dL), and muscle mass (kg) were included in the model as independent variables.

Consistent with the known metabolic dependency of PLP on FMN, our results highlight the importance of riboflavin statusand suggest that it may be the limiting nutrient for maintaining adequate vitamin B-6 status, particularly among older people in whom PLP concentrations are lowest, as shown here andelsewhere ( 33,36,37,39). We examined determinants of PLP using multiple linear regression in a subset of participants with available dietary data (i.e., NANS cohort) and showed thatthe strong association of EGRac with PLP was evident after adjustment for other important determinants—namely, dietaryvitamin B-6 intake, supplement use, fortified food, and BMI.Of note, we found that PLP concentrations were lowest in thosewith riboflavin deficiency combined with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype.This suggests that individuals homozygous for this common polymorphism may be most at risk of thefunctional consequences of riboflavin deficiency.
Apart from the functional impact on vitamin B-6 status shown here, there are adverse consequences of this polymorphism when combinedwith riboflavin deficiency ( 40).

The high prevalence of riboflavin deficiency in the present study, as in the NDNS, is of concern. Future dietary recommen- dations should consider that vitamin B-6 status is dependent on notonlydietaryvitaminB-6butalsoadequateriboflavinintakes.Of note, correlations of dietary vitamin -B6 and riboflavin intakes with their respective biomarkers, PLP and EGRac, were strengthened when supplement users were included, perhapspointingtothecontributionofB-vitaminsupplementsinhelping to maintain adequate nutrient status, albeit the wider range of biomarker concentrations could also have contributed tothe stronger correlation observed.Furthermore, the regression analysis showed that age was an important determinant of PLP, but this relationship disappeared when supplement users wereincluded, suggesting that older people in particular may benefit fromB-vitaminsupplementationtooffsettheage-relateddecline in PLP, as previously suggested ( 32,43).
Fortification could also have beneficial effects in optimizing the status of these B- vitamins, with previous evidence that PLP concentrations are higher, and EGRac lower, in regular consumers of fortified food(44). Unlike in the United Kingdom and Ireland, a mandatory enrichment program is in place in the United States and Canada,whereby riboflavin lost from grain during processing is added.Despite such policy, there is some evidence from a small cohort of Canadian females to indicate that low riboflavin is prevalent,suggesting that, at current levels, added riboflavin in North America may be insufficient to maintain adequate riboflavin status (45).
Beyond the metabolic consequences (for PLP) of riboflavindeficiency,asshownhereandpreviously( 20,21),there maybelong-termadversehealthimpacts.Wepreviouslyshowed thatlowPLPconcentrationsatbaselinepredictedagreaterrateofcognitive decline over a 4-y follow-up period among adults aged >60 y (14) and were associated with a 45% and 73% increased risk of depression and anxiety, respectively, in the TUDA study(15). Moreover, suboptimal riboflavin status is associated with a higher risk of anemia in females ( 29) and higher blood pressure in adults from 18 y when combined with the variant MTHFR 677TTgenotype( 41).Giventhepotentialadversehealthimpacts, even in the absence of clinical deficiency, the high prevalence of riboflavin deficiency shown here and previously reported ( 36) requires further investigation.The current study has a number of strengths.
Although previous studies in this area were limited by small sample sizes(21,31), we report the association of PLP with riboflavin in a large, well-characterized sample of >5000 adults (aged 18– 102 y), including nationally representative data. Our study addsconsiderably to previous findings in relation to PLP in older adults (46) as regards its interrelationship with riboflavin.A 1776 Jarrett et al.

In addition, all analyses from the 3 component cohorts of the study were centralized to 1 laboratory using standardized protocolstoensureconsistency.Moreover,correspondingdietaryintake data were available for almost 1000 participants from a nationally representative cohort of Irish adults, enabling the effectofriboflavinandotherdeterminantsofPLPtobeexaminedfollowing adjustment for dietary vitamin B-6 intake. This is also the first study to consider the relationship of MTHFRgenotype withtheseinterrelatednutrients.Themainlimitationofthisstudyis the observational design that does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the causality of the observed associations.
In conclusion, the current findings show that, independent of dietary vitamin B-6 intake, plasma PLP is strongly associated with riboflavin status across adulthood, confirming the known metabolicdependencyofvitaminB-6onFMN.Furthermore,theadverse impact of riboflavin deficiency on PLP appears to be exacerbatedif combinedwith the MTHFR677TTgenotype.Our observations thus suggest that riboflavin is the limiting nutrientfor maintaining adequate concentrations of PLP, particularly in older adults and in those with the variant MTHFR genotype.These findings have important implications for emerging dietary recommendationsinage-andsex-specificsubgroupsinthattheyindicatethatdietaryriboflavinintakeshouldbeconsideredwhen setting vitamin B-6 recommendations. Randomized trials are, however, necessary to investigate the PLP response to riboflavinintervention at doses within the dietary range.
