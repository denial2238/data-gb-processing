Here, we present a longitudinal investigation towards the 47 importance of RBPR2 and influence of the diet on systemic retinoid homeostasis for visual 48 function. Age matched Rbpr2 -KO (Rbpr2-/-) and wild -type (WT) mice were fed either a 49 vitamin A sufficient (VAS) or a vitamin A deficient (VAD) diet.At 3- and 6 -months, we 50 performed retinoid quant ification of ocular and non -ocular tissues using HPLC analysis 51 and complemented the data with visual physiology, rhodopsin quantification by 52 spectrophotometry, and biochemical analysis.At 3-months and compared to WT mice , 53 Rbpr2-/- mice fed either vitamin A diets displayed lower scotopic and photopic 54 electroretinogram (ERG) responses , which correlated with HPLC analysis that revealed 55 Rbpr2-/- mice had significantly lower hepatic and ocular retinoid content.
Interestingly, with 56 the exception of the l iver, long -term feeding of Rbpr2-/- mice with a VAS diet promoted all - 57 trans retinol accumulation in most peripheral tissues. However, even under VAS dietary 58 conditions significant amounts of unliganded opsins in rods, together with decreased 59 visual respons es were evident in aged mice lacking RBPR2, when compared to WT mice.60 Together, our analyses characterize the molecular events underlying nutritional blindness 61 in a novel mouse model and indicate that loss of the liver specific RBP4 -ROL receptor, 62 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted July 11, 2024.

Upon light exposure, 11 -cis retinal is isomerized to 74 all-trans retinal, causing a photobleaching process where rhodopsin forms several 75 different intermediate states that trigger a G -protein signaling pathway . The vitamin A 76 metabolite a tRA is a hormo ne-like molecule that regulates gene expression through 77 interactions with nuclear rec eptors that are critical for the differentiation and patterning of 78 the eyes .Vitamin A deficiency in the eye leads to impaired night vision due to deficient 79 rhodopsin formation and if left untreated can cause photoreceptor cell death and 80 blindness4.
Thus, an understanding of mechanisms that facilitate a nd regulate the uptake, 81 transport, and long -term storage of dietary vitamin A /ROL for systemic retinoid 82 homeostasis is significant to the design of strategies aimed at attenuating retinal 83 degenerative diseases associated with ocular ROL deficiency in condi tions like Retinitis 84 Pigmentosa or Leber Congenital Amaurosis6-18. 85 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted July 11, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602543doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 The main transport form of dietary vitamin A in the circulation to peripheral tissues 86 is all-trans retinol (ROL), which is bound to the retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) as holo - 87 RBP4 (RBP4 -ROL)1,2,19 -20.
Two membrane receptors that bind to RBP4 and facilitate the 88 internalization of ROL into tissues from the circulation have been proposed. Previously, 89 biochemical and genetic evidence have shown the involvement of Stimulated by Retinoic 90 Acid 6 (STRA6) that is highly expressed in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), in the 91 uptake of circulatory RBP4 -ROL into the eye21-23.STRA6 is however not expressed in 92 major peripheral/non -ocular tissues, including the liver that functions as the main stor age 93 organ for dietary vitamin A2,24-29.This indicates that alternate vitamin A receptors might 94 exist in such tissues, which may be responsible for whole -body retinoid homeostasis in 95 the support of chromophore production.First identified by the Graham lab oratory in 2013, 96 the retinol binding protein 4 receptor 2, RBPR2 or STRA6like (STRA6l), is implicated in 97 the systemic tissue uptake and storage of ROL from RBP430.
Our previous biochemical 98 and genetic analysis of RBPR2 in cell lines, and in zebrafish and m ice deficient in RBPR2, 99 showed that it was a bona fide RBP4 -vitamin A receptor and involved in ROL 100 internalization26-28. Additionally, we have previously showed that RBPR2 contain s specific 101 RBP4 -ROL binding motifs and loss of the systemic vitamin A transporter, RBPR2, in mice 102 resulted in visual function defects24,25.However, it is yet unknown what long -term effects 103 of the diet are in Rbpr2-/- mice in maintaining systemic and ocular retinoid homeostasis, 104 and on the quantitative relationship between chromophore and opsins in the generation 105 of rhodopsin for visual function and in maintaining retinal health.106 To answer these questions, we have now conducted a longitudinal study in Rbpr2-107 /- and WT mice fed with either a vitamin A sufficient (VAS) or vitamin A deficient (VAD) 108 .

Even though RBPR2 is not expressed in the eye, we observed that mice lacking 115 the systemic vitamin A receptor, RBPR2, display characteristic features of not only 116 systemic retinoid deficiency, but also lower ocular retinoid levels, which result in 117 decreased phototransduction. We further show that in the absence of RBPR2 and under 118 long-term dietary vitamin A restriction, these mice are more susceptible to ocular 119 conse quences of vitamin A deprivation, which included lower rhodopsin concentrations, 120 delayed kinetics in rod and cone opsin regeneration under scotopic and photopic 121 conditions, and the presence of unliganded opsins in rod photoreceptors, altogether 122 affecting v isual function.123 Together, our study demonstrates the importance of the systemic RBP4 -ROL 124 receptor, RBPR2, for maintaining liver retinoid homeostasis that is important for the 125 critical balance between chromophore and opsins in visual pigment synthesis.
Our study 126 establishes the RBP4 -ROL transporter, RBPR2, as an important component of whole - 127 body retinoid homeostasis and mammalian visual function, especially under fasting or 128 restricted dietary vitamin A conditions, where it plays a critical role in preventin g retinal 129 pathologies associated with ocular vitamin A deprivation. 130 131 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted July 11, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602543doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 MATERIALS AND METHOD S 132 Materials 133 All chemicals unless stated otherwise were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, 134 USA) and were of molecular or cell culture grade quality.

Groups of WT and Rbpr2-/- mice were fed either a vitamin A 267 sufficient (VAS ; 4 IU vitamin A/g ) or vitamin A deficient (VAD ; 0.22 IU/g ) diet post weaning 268 at P21 , which are custom diets routinely used to control vitamin A status in mice34,35. The 269 percentage difference of dietary vitamin A between the two diets is 180%.Additionally, 270 the 4 IU retinol/g concentration in the VAS diet is consistent with the recommended 271 vitam in A intake for rodents and corresponds to 1.2 mg retinol activity equivalent (RAE), 272 which is also a recommended intake in humans.After 3 -months of dietary intervention, 273 the first cohort of mice were sacrificed to determine the short -term effects , while the 274 second cohort of mice were sacrificed after 6 -months of dietary intervention to determine 275 the long -term effects of vitamin A deficiency on systemic all -trans retinol uptake and liver 276 storage and on ocular health in the different genotypes ( Figure 1 ).
277 278 Effect of the diet on systemic and ocular all -trans retinol levels in Rbpr2-/- mice 279 Unlike STRA6, the vitamin A receptor, RBPR2 , is highly expressed in the liver and to a 280 lesser extent in systemic/ non -ocular tissues to support dietary vitamin A storage and re - 281 absorption of circulatory ROL from RBP4 -ROL2,20,24,25,30,36 ,37,38. Thus, the RBPR2 282 receptor is proposed to regulate whole -body retinoid homeostasis, which is important to 283 the supply of all -trans ROL to the eye for maintaining ocular rhodopsin levels for 284 phototransduction, especially under fasting conditions2,30,37.We first examined how global 285 loss of RBPR2 in mice affects systemic all -trans retinol (ROL) levels in ocular and non - 286 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Similarly, when we measured all -trans ROL levels 294 in various non -ocular tissues we observed lower ROL concentrations in Rbpr2-/- mice on 295 VAD die ts, compared to WT mice on VAS diets ( Supplemental Figure S3). These results 296 indicate that in the absence of RBPR2 and under vitamin A restriction, Rbpr2-/- mice are 297 more susceptible to vitamin A deficiency, which affects liver and eye retinoid stores 298 (Figure 3 ).299 We then investigated the long -term effects of the diet in Rbpr2-/- and WT mice on 300 ROL levels in the liver and eye.In WT mice under either diets, ROL levels in the liver 301 were not significantly affected, however, total retinoids in liver were lo wer in WT mice 302 under VAD diets, indicating that stored retinoids were likely being distributed under 303 vitamin A restriction ( Figures 4A -C).In Rbpr2-/- mice under either diets, ROL and total 304 retinoid concentrations in liver were lower to those of WT mice ( Figures 4A -C).
The total 305 mass loss of ROL stores in Rbpr2-/- mice under either diet was 80% lower compared to 306 WT mice under VAS diets ( Figure 4D ).

312 Conversely, in Rbpr2-/- mice under VAD conditions, ocular ROL and total retinoid levels 313 were significantly lower to WT mice under VAS or VAD or Rbpr2-/- mice under VAS 314 conditions ( Figure s 4E-G). Additionally, 11 -cis retinal levels in Rbpr2-/- mice under VAD 315 diets, were significantly lower those WT mice under VAD or VAS conditions ( Figure 4G ).316 Similarly, when we measured all -trans ROL levels in various non -ocular tissues at the 6 - 317 month time point we observed lower ROL concentrations in these tissues of Rbpr2-/- mice 318 on VAD diets, compared to Rbpr2-/- mice on VAS diet or WT mice on VAD or VAS diets 319 (Supplementa l Figure S4).These re sults suggest a major role for RBPR2 in maintaining 320 ROL and total retinoid homeostasis in the liver and other non -ocular/ systemic tissues for 321 RBP4 -ROL uptake and re -distribution to the eye especially under fasting conditions 322 (Figure 3B ).

This picture changed 332 under long -term VAD diets. WT mice showed no changes in ERG amplitudes under either 333 diets, however, Rbpr2-/- mice showed an even more severe decrease in a-wave and b- 334 wave visual responses, compared to either Rbpr2-/- on VAS or WT mice on VAD and VAS 335 diets at the 6 -month analysis time -point ( Figures 5D -F).Kinetic measurement of rod 336 opsin recovery were also found to be slower in Rbpr2-/- mice on VAS or VAD diets, 337 compared to WT mice on VAS diet, likely indicating decreased concentrations of the 338 visual chromophore rhodopsin (Figure s 6A-6D).
339 340 Rod p hotoreceptors of Rbpr2−/− mice display significant levels of apoprotein opsin 341 Since Rbpr2−/− mice display reduced scotopic visual responses and decreased kinetics 342 of rod opsin recovery, we hypothesized that this phenotype is caused by imbalances 343 between chromophore and opsin concentrations in rod photoreceptors and likely to the 344 presence of unliga nded rod opsins or apoprotein opsins. It has been proposed previously 345 that accumulation of apoprotein opsin/unliganded opsin can activate the 346 phototransduction cascade even under dark conditions13-15,18,32.The constitutive activity 347 of apoprotein opsin in photoreceptors is considered equivalent to background light and 348 can result in a reduction in phototransduction gain17,18,33.We first analyzed the 349 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a serious health issue, which is 390 correlative with higher rates of mortality, childhood obesity, and nutritional blindness, 391 especially among children in poorer countries around the world39,40 ,42. Vitamin A 392 constitutes a group of biochemical compounds, including retinol, retinaldehyde, retinoic 393 acid, and be ta-carotene39-41.Most pertinent for visual function , 11-cis retinaldehyde 394 (retinal) combines with the GPCR protein opsin in the photoreceptor outer segments to 395 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted July 11, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602543doi: bioRxiv preprint 18 generate rhodopsin2,4.
Prolonged VAD in the eye leads to impaired night vision due to 396 deficient rhodopsin formation and can cause photoreceptor cell death and blindness4. 397 Thus, an understanding of mechanisms that facilitate and regulate the uptake, transport, 398 and long -term storage of ROL for systemic and ocular retinoid homeostasis is significant 399 to the design of strategies aimed at attenuating retinal degenerative diseases associ ated 400 with ocular ROL deficiency6-18.401 In this study, we investigated the systemic and ocular consequences resulting from 402 loss of the second RBP4 -vitamin A transporter, RBPR2 , on a longitudinal timescale.403 Previously, we have established a global Rbpr2 -knockout ( Rbpr2-/-) mice and have 404 demonstrated that these mice are susceptible to visual deficiencies19.Here, we sought to 405 expand upon that study in several critical ways.
First, through a modified normal phase 406 HPLC method, we are able to resolve retinaldehyde and retinol isomers, rather than just 407 resolve total retinoid content. This is especially importan t for retinoid analysis in ocular 408 tissues and allows us to directly detect and quantify critical retinoid isomers such as 11 - 409 cis retinal, the visual chromophore responsible for activation of the phototransduction 410 cascade.Second, we have performed this ana lysis on multiple systemic tissues across 411 multiple organs systems, rather than just in ocular tissue.Given that RBPR2 is 412 hypothesized to regulate systemic vitamin A homeostasis, we aimed to examine the 413 changes to retinoid content on a systemic level in th ese Rbpr2-/- mice.
Third, to investigate 414 the underlying causes for reduced electroretinogram responses in Rbpr2-/- mice , we 415 utilized UV -Vis spectrophotometry to determine whether the ocular levels of vitamin A 416 affect the stoichiometric balance between GPCR protein opsin and the visual 417 chromophore, 11 -cis retinal, in the photoreceptors. 418 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted July 11, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602543doi: bioRxiv preprint 19 All-trans retinol bound to RBP4 (RBP4 -ROL) is the fundamental transport form of 419 vitamin A found within the circulation, and its distribution must be tightly regulated in the 420 support of multiple body functions including visual function.
RBPR2 is the analogous 421 RBP4 -vitamin A receptor to ocular STRA6 and is expressed in major peripheral organs 422 including the liver, the main storage organ for dietary vitamin A. Prior to its discovery and 423 characterization in 2013, various groups of researchers have hypothesized about the 424 existence of a mechanism that allows for the liver to intake circulatory RBP4 -ROL.Now 425 that the existence of RBPR2 is known and its molecular functions are characterized, 426 investigations towards the understanding of its physiological functions has since bee n 427 conducted.Given its ability to uptake circulatory RBP4 -ROL, we hypothesize that RBPR2 428 could be responsible for systemic retinoid homeostasis, and that disruption of RBPR2 429 might result in altered retinoid levels in peripheral organs, including the eye.
430 To investigate if loss of RBPR2 affected retinoid concentrations on a systemic 431 level, we performed HPLC analysis on various systemic organs, including the liver, on 432 wildtype and Rbpr2-/- mice . Furthermore, we have performed this age -matched analysis 433 at bot h the 3 -month and 6 -month timepoints.In all analyzed tissues, all -trans retinol (ROL) 434 was the predominant (if not only) retinoid found in all analyzed systemic tissue, with the 435 exception of retinyl esters in liver and retinaldehydes in ocular tissue.This is congruent 436 with ROL being the predominant transport form of dietary vitamin A in mammalian 437 organisms.Hence, quantification of ROL will serve as viable metric for determination of 438 retinoid levels in these tissues.To provide a more intuitive representat ion of the 439 normalized ROL quantification data, a heatmap plot of ROL levels across analyzed 440 tissues, genotypes, and time points was generated.From this heatmap plot, a clear 441 .

In particular, circulatory retinyl 447 esters within chylomicrons originating from the VAS diet provides the most likely 448 explanation for maintenance of ROL levels comparab le to WT in these Rbpr2-/- mice at 449 both 3 -month and 6 -month time points , since this pathway bypasses the loss of Rbpr2***. 450 Similar, observations were obtained in Stra6-/- mice fed a high vitamin A diet29,32.451 However, for the Rbpr2-/- mice fed a VAD diet, this supplementary pathway does not exist.452 Once residual retinoid stores from gestation run out at the 6 -month timepoint, these 453 Rbpr2-/- mice fed a VAD diet exhibit greatly decreased ROL levels.454 We next examined the retinoid supply and con sumption axis in the support of 455 visual function, by examining retinoid quantities in the liver and eye.
While the liver was 456 found to contain ROL like all other systemic tissues, the liver additionally contains 457 considerable levels of retinyl palmitate, cong ruent with its role as the main storage organ 458 of dietary vitamin A, with storage of retinoids predominantly in the form of retinyl esters 459 within hepatic stellate cells. At both the 3 -month and 6 -month timepoints, hepatic ROL 460 levels were found to be signifi cantly lower for Rbpr2-/- mice on both VAS and VAD diets 461 (Figure s 2B and 4B).However, Rbpr2-/- mice fed the VAS diet generally exhibited 462 comparable total hepatic retinoid levels when compared to WT mice fed a VAS diet at 463 both the 3 -month and 6 -month time points , while Rbpr2-/- mice fed VAD diets exhibited 464 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

More critically, these depressed 474 retinoid levels coexist with chang es on the phenotypic level, with Rbpr2-/- mice under VAD 475 conditions exhibiting mislocalized opsins within photoreceptor inner segments (Figure s 476 7A-B), increased ratios of unliganded apoprotein opsin (Figure s 7C-7E), and decreased 477 rod and cone responses as measured with scotopic and photopic ERGs respectively 478 (Figure s 5, 6, 8, and 9). 479 In the past, investigations into mice exhibiting disruptions in the generation of 11 - 480 cis retinal has displayed phenotypes such as elev ated levels of apoprotein opsins and 481 subsequent retinal degeneration, such as in mice with disrupted Stra6 and 482 Rpe6514,15,17,32.In particular, Rpe65-/- mice, a mice model for the retinal degenerative 483 disease Leber Congenital Amaurosis, has been shown to exhibit an elevated 484 concentration of apoprotein opsin.
RPE65 is an isomerohydrolase responsible for the 485 conversion of retinyl esters to 11 -cis retinol wi thin the visual cycle, which is in turn 486 necessary for the generation of 11 -cis retinal chromophore in photoreceptors.

In a study investigating 491 the phenotypic effects of Stra6-/- mice, which disrupts not only the intake of ROL from 492 circulatory RBP4 -ROL into the RPE, but also the subsequent generation of the 11 -cis 493 retinal chromophore , these mice exhibited elevated concentrations of apoprotein opsin 494 and retinal degeneration much like Rpe65-/- mice, but additionally also mislocalization of 495 rod and cone opsins within the photoreceptor s32. These observations in Stra6-/- and 496 Rpe65-/- mice w ere also reflected in Rbpr2-/- mice, where significant rhodopsin 497 mislocalization was observed in these mice fed VAS or VAD diets, but not in WT mice 498 even on the VAD diet (Figures 7A , 7B).Moreover, studies examining the phenotypic 499 effects of Stra6-/- mice additionally studied the effects of applying pharmacological doses 500 of vitamin A as a means rescuing the ocular phenotypes in these mice.
These studies 501 show that interventions with high doses of ROL increase the total retinoid content found 502 within ocu lar tissues, despite lacking a vitamin A membrane receptor to access circulatory 503 RBP4 -ROL due to its lack of functional STRA6. This is a result that was also reflected in 504 Rbpr2-/- mice, where a VAS diet is able to supplement systemic retinol levels despite the 505 disruption of vitamin A homeostasis through disruption of RBPR229,32.As mentioned 506 above, the retinoid delivery system in mammalian organisms exhibits plasticity in 507 redundancy, where chylomicron transport of retinyl esters originating from the diet ca n 508 act as a possible alternate pathway for delivering retinoids to systemic tissues19.509 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
