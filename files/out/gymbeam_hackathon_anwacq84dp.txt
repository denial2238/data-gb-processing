We hypothesized that the addition of collagen would improve long- term mechanical properties and matrix production (e.g. colla- gen and glycosaminoglycans) through increased bioactivity.Agarose hydrogels (2% w/v) were mixed with varying concentrations of collagen type I (0, 2 and 5 mg/ml).Juvenile bovine chondro- cytes were added to the hydrogels to assess matrix production over 4 weeks through biochemical assays, and mechanical properties were assessed through unconﬁned compression.We observed a dose-dependent effect on cell bioactivity, where 2 mg/ml of collagen improved bioactivity, but 5 mg/ml had a negative impact on bioactivity.This resulted in a higher modulus for scaffolds supplemented with lower collagen concentration as compared to the higher collagen concentration, but not when compared to the control.
In conclusion, the addition of collagen to agarose constructs provided a dose-dependent impact on improving glycosaminoglycan production but did not improve collagen production or compressive mechanics. Keywords: hydrogel; tissue engineering; composition; agarose-collagen matrix; mechanics Introduction Gradients in tissue composition are found throughout the body, connecting materials with different stiffnesses, in turn, creatinggradients in mechanical properties [ 1].Mechanical gradients are of particular importance at interfaces of soft and hard tissues, like tendon or cartilage to bone, where sudden mismatches instiffness create stress concentrations that contribute to tissue failure [ 2].Gradients in fiber architecture and tissue composition can alleviate stress concentrations between materials with mis- matched mechanical properties [ 1,3].
Replicating tissue and me- chanical gradients is important for the successful integration ofengineered tissue with surrounding native tissues. Gradients in tissue stiffness, fiber orientation and tissue com- position exist through the thickness of articular cartilage [ 4].Cartilage is commonly described as having three zones whose properties are directly affected by composition: the stiff superficial zone, where collagen type II is organized parallel to the surface, atransition or mid-zone with high quantities of glycosaminogly- cans (GAG) and randomly aligned collagen fibers, and a deep zonenear the bone where collagen is oriented perpendicular to the surface [ 4,5].This organization results in increasing compressive and shear moduli from the superficial to deep zone, while tensile modulus decreases, allowing energy to be dissipated through the depth of the tissue [ 2,6].
Agarose hydrogels have been specifically used for cartilage tis- sue engineering because of their ability to maintain a rounded chondrogenic phenotype, which has been observed to stimulate GAG production, resulting in compressive mechanical properties that approach native values [ 7]. Collagen type I hydrogels mixed with other gels, including agarose, alginate and collagen type II, have resulted in increased cell-matrix interactions and GAG pro- duction [ 8–10].Studies that used an agarose-collagen mixture have shown an increase in cell bioactivity.These studies have evaluated gene ex- pression over multiple weeks [ 9,11,12].However, we have little insight into whether collagen-agarose blends develop functional engineered cartilage, as gene expression is an imperfect indicator of protein production [ 13,14].Hydrogels by themselves exhibit Received: April 19, 2022.Revised: June 14, 2022.Accepted: July 10, 2022 VCThe Author(s) 2022.Published by Oxford University Press.

Thus, the objective of this work was to characterize the effect of collagen type I on the matrix production of bovine chondro- cytes embedded in an agarose scaffold. We hypothesized that the addition of collagen type I will increase extra-cellular matrix pro- duction and mechanical properties.Furthermore, a low and high dose of collagen was assessed to determine whether there is a dose-dependent effect on matrix production and mechanical be- havior.Materials and methods Sample preparation An agarose gel stock was created by dissolving type VII agarose powder (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 0.15M phosphate-buffered saline (1 /C2PBS) at a concentration of 6% weight over volume (w/v; 1 g/100 ml) by heating to 121/C14C in an autoclave for /C2420 min.The stock gel was then diluted with saline and type I collagen (Bovine, Advanced Biomatrix, CA) to obtain a final concentration of 2% aga- rose gels.
Collagen was added at concentrations of 0 mg/ml for the control (CTL), 2 mg/ml for the low concentration group (LoColl) or 5 mg/ml for the high collagen group (HiColl). Collagen concentra- tions were chosen to facilitate comparisons to previous literatureon agarose-collagen gels [ 9].For cell-based experiments, the stock gel was cooled to /C2440 /C14C before adding chondrocytes (final concen- tration of 30 /C2106cells/ml) and casting the mixture between glass slides.The gel was allowed to cool to room temperature before using a biopsy punch to obtain cylindrical samples (4 mm diameter).
Chondrocyte isolation and culture Junior bovine knee joints were obtained from an abattoir (GreenVillage Packing, NJ), and chondrocytes were obtained by digesting cartilage with type 4 collagenase (activity 375 units/mg dry weight; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewoond, NJ) dissolved in media (DMEM with 5% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% TES, 1% BES, 1% HEPES, 1% sodium bicarbonate, 1% penicillin- streptomycin antimycotic (PS/AM), 2% minimum essential ami-noacids) and shaken overnight inside an incubator (37 /C14C, 5% CO 2). Cells (1 /C2106per vial) were frozen in liquid nitrogen with DMSO until use.Frozen vials were thawed rapidly ( <2 min) in a 37/C14C water bath and then plated in a culture flask.Cells were cul- tured in growth media (DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% PS/AM, 5 ng/ml FGF, 10 ng/ml PDGF and 1 ng/ml TGF b-1) until passage 6 until they were seeded into gels.
Rheometry Oscillatory rheometry (Anton Paar) was performed on cylindrical,acellular gel samples (height ¼2.3 mm; n¼8) using a sandblasted parallel plate with a diameter of 8 mm and a gap size of 2 mm. Samples were created with a diameter of 8 mm to match the di-ameter of the testing plate.A temperature ramp (2 /C14C/min) was performed from 25 to 37/C14C, followed by a 5-min isothermal step at 37/C14C with an oscillatory shear of 1% at 1 Hz.Storage (G’) andloss (G”) moduli were defined as the average of all values recorded at the isothermal step (50 data points).Engineered cartilage Construct culture Cylindrical samples (diameter ¼4 mm, thickness ¼2.3 mm; n¼5 per group for each timepoint for mechanics and biochemicalassays) were cultured in serum-free chondrogenic media (DMEMwith 4.5 g/l glucose and L-glutamine, 1% ITS þPremix, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 100 lg/ml sodium pyruvate) for 4 weeks.
Media was changed three times a week and supplemented to fi-nal concentrations of 50 lg/ml ascorbic acid and 100 nM dexa- methasone on the day of feeding. Media was additionallysupplemented with 10 ng/ml of TGF b-3 for the first 2 weeks of culture.Compressive mechanics Stress-relaxation tests were performed to 10% strain to evaluatecompressive Young’s modulus and time-dependent behavior(10% strain, rate ¼2%/min) on cell-laden cylindrical samples (diameter ¼4 mm, thickness ¼2.3 mm) on Days 1 and 2 (Week 0) and Days 29 and 30 (Week 4) under unconfined compression in a saline bath.Sample diameter and height for each individual sam- ple were measured with a caliper prior to testing.Time points arelabeled as weeks instead of days for convenience, as groups weretested within a 48-h period.Young’s modulus was calculated asthe slope of the linear portion of the loading curve during theramp to 10% strain.
Relaxation was defined as the stress after 30 min divided by the peak stress at the end of the ramp sub- tracted from 1.0 and presented a percentage. Therefore, 0% relax-ation represents a fully elastic material while 100% relaxationrepresents a material that has undergone complete relaxation.Cell viability and imaging Samples were stained and imaged in Weeks 1 and 3 to assess cellviability and observe changes in morphology ( n¼3 from each group; Live/Dead kit, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).The stain-ing solution contained 0.5 ll/ml of Calcein AM to stain live cells and 2 ll/ml of ethidium homodimer-1 in 1 /C2PBS.Samples were protected from light and submerged in staining solution for20 min at room temperature, rinsed with 1 /C2PBS, then imaged within 2 h.Z-stack images were collected at 533 nm for live cells (green) and 640 nm for dead cells (red) using a confocal micro-scope (Praire Technologies; 10 /C2objective).
A custom MATLAB program was used to estimate the number of objects in eachchannel using a grayscale threshold (grayscale level >35 000). Cell viability was measured as the number of live cells divided by the total cell count in the image stack and reported as a percent.Biochemical content After mechanical testing, samples were re-hydrated ( >20 min), weighed, and collected to measure DNA, GAG and collagen con-tents.Specimens were lyophilized (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) for 48 h to determine the dry weight and digested overnight at 56 /C14C with Protenaise K (MP Biomedical, Burlingame, CA).DNA content was determined using the fluorescent PicoGreen assay,GAG content was determined using the colorimetric dimethylmethylene blue assay, and collagen content was determined us-ing the hydroxiproline (OHP) assay.Both GAG and OHP contentwere normalized by DNA content and the sample wet weight.2| Regenerative Biomaterials, 2022, Vol.
9, rbac048 Statistics Due to the relatively small sample size, normality was not as- sumed. A one-way non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis) was performed to assess differences among groups.Comparisons were evaluated for initial and final properties (i.e.in Weeks 0 and4).A Dunn’s multiple comparison post hoc was used to determine specific P-values between groups.Significance was assumed for P/C200.05.Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad PRISM version 9.3 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).Results Changes in mechanical properties Acellular mechanical properties were evaluated using a rheome-ter.The storage modulus for the control group was G’ ¼ 3.661.8 kPa and the loss modulus was G” ¼0.260.1 kPa.There were no significant differences observed in storage or loss modu- lus with the addition of collagen to the hydrogel ( P¼0.2 for G’; P¼0.06 for G”; Fig.1 ).
Variability in measured mechanical proper- ties increased with the addition of collagen, which impacted thepower of the analysis ( b¼0.14). There were significant differences in the initial mechanical properties of seeded scaffolds tested un-der unconfined compression ( P<0.01; Fig.1C —Week 0).Specifically, the Young’s modulus of the HiColl group was 47.8633.0 kPa, which was more than 3 /C2greater than the CTL group (14.4 62.6 kPa) at Week 0 ( Fig.1C ;P¼0.009).All scaffolds experienced 50–60% relaxation during the 30-min hold, with nosignificant differences with respect to collagen supplementation(P¼0.11; Fig.1D ).Final bulk mechanical properties measured at Week 4 showed that the Young’s modulus for CTL and LoColl groups were 2.6 /C2stiffer than the HiColl group ( P<0.01; Fig.1C ).There were no significant differences in compressive Young’smodulus between CTL and LoColl groups.
At Week 4, the percentof relaxation for the LoColl group was 21% lower than HiColl(38.969.8% and 59.7 616.5%, respectively; P¼0.02; Fig. 1D .However, there were no significant differences in percent relaxa- tion with respect to the CTL group ( P¼0.35).Changes in construct size The HiColl group presented a larger diameter than the CTL group when normalized by Week 0 diameter ( P¼0.006; Fig.2A ).This dif- ference was due to a 6% decrease in diameter for the CTL groupand a /C2410% increase in diameter for the HiColl group from initial values (i.e.Week 0).However, these differences did not translateto significant differences in construct height or volume at Week 4 (P>0.05; Fig.2B, C ).Changes in matrix production No differences in DNA content were observed between groups at Week 0 or Week 4, suggesting that cells were seeded evenly, andthe added initial collagen did not alter cell proliferation ( Fig.3A ).At Week 1, all groups had high cell viability ( >90%; P¼0.23; Fig.
3B ), and there were no noticeable differences in cell morphol- ogy ( Fig. 3C —top row).After 3 weeks of culture, cell viability was lower for the CTL (75.8 613.2%) and LoColl groups (78.6 62.1%; Fig.3B ), and cells from all groups showed an elongated pheno- type ( Fig.3C —bottom row).Dedifferentiation of chondrocytes was observed in all gels at Week 3 ( Fig.3C ), which may be due to increases in substrate stiffness with matrix deposition or to usingpassaged cells rather than primary cells [ 15–17].The addition of collagen resulted in statistically significant dif- ferences in the initial collagen content, as expected ( Fig.4A, C — Week 0).In Week 4, the LoColl group was more biologically activethan CTL, based on OHP/DNA (LoColl ¼6.7 g/g CTL ¼4.2 g/g; P¼0.02), but not significantly more active than the HiColl group (5.1 g/g; P¼0.23, Fig.4A ).There was also a trend for greater ma- trix biosynthesis in the LoColl group with respect to GAG produc- tion ( Fig.4B ;P¼0.059).
However, these differences in matrix biosynthesis were not reflected in overall differences in tissuecomposition when normalized by wet weight, as commonly per-formed in the literature ( Fig. 4C, D ).Discussion The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of incorpo- rating collagen within agarose to increase matrix synthesis dur-ing a month-long 3D culture.GAG growth in CTL and LoCollgroups were similar to previously reported values for agarose-only gels [ 7], resulting in compressive properties within the range of native values (240–850 kPa) [ 18].A previous study found that the addition of collagen type I in the range of 2–4.5 mg/ml in-creased GAG production from nucleus pulposus cells embeddedin agarose [ 9].The addition of collagen to the agarose hydrogel in this study demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on cell bioactiv- ity, where 2 mg/ml of collagen improved bioactivity but thehigher concentration had a negative impact on cell bioactivity.
The addition of collagen to the agarose scaffold only altered elastic mechanical properties at higher strains. The increase inYoung’s modulus of agarose-collagen gels agreed with an Figure 1.(A,B) Rheological properties of acellular hydrogels.(A) Storage modulus and (B) loss modulus at 37/C14C.No signiﬁcant differences were observed between groups ( P>0.2).( C,D) Initial (W0) and ﬁnal (W4) compressive mechanics of engineered cartilage constructs.(C) Linear region young’s modulus and (D) percent relaxation measured during the hold period of a stress-relaxation test.Each sample is plotted as a data point, with rectangles and bar s representing mean 6standard deviation.* represents P<0.05.** represents P<0.0.1.Regenerative Biomaterials, 2022, Vol.9, rbac048 |3 experimental study by Kopf et al.[12].The increase in stiffness may be due to greater fiber engagement as the non-fibrillar aga-rose matrix experiences deformation [ 19].
Similarly, a lack of ob- served changes with increased collagen on rheologicalmechanics agreed with data from Cambria et al. , when correcting the reported P-values for the number of observations (i.e.running a one-way ANOVA rather than multiple t-tests) [ 9].Discrepancies in absolute values between data reported in this study andCambria et al.[9] may be due to differences in surface treatment and geometry of the parallel plates used in rheometry [ 20].The discrepancy in findings between testing modalities may beexplained by a decrease in fiber engagement during rheometry.That is, unconfined compression testing was performed at 10%strain, while oscillatory rheometry reached maximum strains of1%, which is not high enough to detect strain-stiffening behaviorin collagen gels [ 21].
The non-linear behavior of engineered carti- lage suggests that greater differences may have been observed athigher strains [ 22]; however, 10% strain was used in this study to represent moderate physiological loading and compare to exist- ing data in the literature [ 23–25]. Initial time-dependent relaxa- tion behavior was not altered by collagen, agreeing with previouswork that the evaluated time-dependent behavior of agarose- collagen gels with indentation testing [ 26].The relaxation behav- ior of the agarose-collagen blend is thought to be dominated by the agarose matrix [ 26,27]; thus, it was unaffected by the rela- tively low quantities of collagen added (0.1–0.25% of total w/v).A dose-dependent effect was also observed in matrix deposi- tion, with the greatest GAG/DNA and OHP/DNA content at Week4 in the LoColl group ( Fig.4A, B ).
GAG content is directly linked to compressive mechanics, which was also observed in this study,where the HiColl group was initially stiffer than the CTL andLoColl groups (Week 0) but was less stiff at Week 4 when the GAGcontent was also lower. The lower GAG content also resulted in agreater relaxation response when compared to other groups(Fig.1D ), agreeing with trends of energy dissipation seen in native articular cartilage [ 28].Extra-cellular matrix deposition did not affect overall construct size between groups, as all groups showed similar values for volume at Week 4 relative to their ini- tial volume ( Fig.2C ).Previous research has shown that collagen gels may experience a decrease in size over time due to contrac-tile cell forces on fibers [ 9,29], but this was not observed in this study.
The lack of scaffold contraction was likely due to themuch higher agarose concentration and the use of chondrocytes,both of which have been shown to counter the effects of cell-mediated contraction in collagen gels [ 11,30]. While collagen type II is the predominate type in native carti- lage, collagen type I was used here based on previous in vitro studies [ 11,31].However, a recent study showed that the blend- ing both type I and II collagen had a greater impact on GAG pro-duction and gene expression (Sox9, aggrecan, Coll I, II, X) when compared to pure collagen I scaffolds, suggesting the mechanical function of our gels could have been further improved by includ-ing both collagen type I and II [ 10].
Improving collagen production in engineered cartilage has been a significant challenge.Degrading the early production of GAGs with chondroitinase ABChas resulted in greater improvements in collagen production(75% increase over wet weight when compared to the control)than what was observed in this study [ 17]. This study is not without limitations.First, collagen is expected to have a greater impact on tensile properties, whichwas not assessed here due to the challenges of culturing longer Figure 2.Dimensions of engineered cartilage constructs at Week 4 (W4), normalized by dimensions at Week 0: ( A) diameter (d), ( B) height (h) and (C) volume ( V¼pd 2/C16/C172 h).Each sample is plotted as a data point, with rectangles and bars representing mean 6standard deviation.** represents P<0.01.Figure 3.

We did not in- vestigate the specific collagen types in this study due to the rel- atively minimal benefits observed in supplementing theagarose scaffold with collagen under static culture conditions.Regardless, our findings support the notion that collagen sup-plementation at a lower concentration can increase chondro-cyte bioactivity within an agarose hydrogel, as suggested in the literature. However, the increase in bioactivity did not greatly increase collagen production outside the range of previouslyreported values for engineered cartilage ( /C241.5%/WW versus na- tive/C2410%/WW).Thus, the overall impact of using a collagen- agarose blend to increase collagen production in engineeredcartilage is low under static culture conditions.Acknowledgements We would like to thank Drs Kevin Healy and Anouk Killars fortheir help with rheological measurements.Funding This work was supported by the National Science Foundation(NSF), Grant Number [DGE 1752814].Conﬂicts of interest statement .
