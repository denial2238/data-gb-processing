Therefore, the present ﬁndings suggest that ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L. leaves can be a very interesting candidate for the research and development of natural and healthy herbal medicine for the phar-maceutical and food industries.1.Introduction In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has attracted more and more attention by the advantages of least toxicity, dif ﬁcult to form drug resistance, safety and environmental protection, and applied widely in the agriculture, food and medicine industries.Tribulus terrestris L.is usually used to treat the illness in eyes, cuta- neous pruritus ( Nam et al., 2016 ), chest tightness or pain ( Nam et al., 2016 ), hypoimmunity, cerebral disease ( Zhang et al., 2010 ;Phillips et al., 2006 ), and cancer ( Kim et al., 2011 ).
In addition, it exhibited better pharmacological activities, including antioxidant ( Hammoda et al., 2013 ; Sailaja et al., 2013 ), antimicrobial ( Zhang et al., 2006 ;Gopinath et al., 2012 ), anti-in ﬂammatory ( Hammoda et al., 2013 ;Mohammed et al., 2014 ), enhancement the level of hormones and gonadotropins ( Marti- no-Andrade, 2010 ;Kam et al., 2012 ;Moghaddam et al., 2013 ;Fatima and Sultana, 2017 ), alleviating muscle damages ( Ma et al., 2017 ),improving mitochondrial dysfunction ( Reshma et al., 2016 ), inﬂuence cytological and genetic effects of cultured human lymphocytes ( Qari and El-Assouli, 2017 ), and regulation of the enzyme activity ( Ercan and Nehir El, 2016 ). Modern pharmacology studies have demonstrated that ﬂavonoids constituent is an important category of natural compound with better antioxidant ( Jiang et al., 2014 ), antibacterial, analgesic, cardiovascular protective effect ( Jiang et al., 2014 ;Li et al., 2014 ) and anti-in ﬂammatory activities.Guo et al.

The aims of the present study were to optimize the extraction process of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L. leaves by single factors test and response surface method, and to identify the chemical components by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS2, and then further to eval- uate its antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic and anti-in ﬂammatory activities.2.Materials and methods 2.1.Instruments and reagents HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS2analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and Agilent model Ion Trap mass spectrom- eter equipped with electrospray ionization ion source (ESI).The content and antioxidant activities of total ﬂavonoids were assayed with T6 ul- traviolet and visible spectrophotometer (Beijing Puxi Tongyong Inc., China).Standard of rutin, dexamethasone (Dex) and gentamicin (HPLC purity>98.0%) were purchased from National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (Shenyang, China).
DPPH, ABTS, TPTZ, LPS, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 -diphenylte- trazolium bromide (MTT) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO).Other chemicals were of analytical grade.Standard strains Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella (ATCC 51812), Staphyloccocus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Streptococcus (ATCC 49619) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.RAW 264.7 cells were purchased from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).2.2.Animals Male Kunming mice (3 –4 weeks, 18 –22 g) were provided by Liaoning Changsheng biotechnology co.LTD and fed at room temperature of 24 /C6 1/C14C, humidity 60% –65% with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle.Animal care and the experimental protocol followed the principles and guidelines suggested by Shenyang Agricultural University of Animal Experimenta- tion (COBEA) and were approved by the local ethical committee.2.3.

Single factor experiments According to the preliminary experiments and references, six levels of three major in ﬂuence factors were set as follows: concentration of ethanol solution 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, ratio of solvent to material 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 ml/g, and extraction time 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min in single factor experiments, and the extraction yield of ﬂavo- noids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L. leaves was selected as the index.When evaluated any one of in ﬂuence factors, the level of other two factors was the fourth one.2.4.2.Optimization of extraction conditions by Box-Behnken design (BBD) Based on the results of single factors experiments, a Box-Behnken design (Design-Expert software, Trial Version 8.0.6, State, Inc., Minne- apolis, USA) of three variables and three levels was introduced to opti- mize the extraction parameters for ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.
Three independent variables including concentration of ethanol solution, ratio of solvent to material and extraction time, and their three levels were listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 2 , the BBD was consisted of twelve factorial points and ﬁve replicates of central points in this experiment, and the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves was taken as dependent variable.Each experimental run was performed in triplicate except the ﬁve centre points.2.4.3.Determination of total ﬂavonoids content Total ﬂavonoids content (TFC) of Tribulus terrestris L.leaves was measured using aluminum nitrate-sodium nitrite-sodium hydroxide colorimetric method according to the previous reported ( Tian et al., 2017 ).The absorbance value at 510 nm was used to determine TFC, which was expressed as percentage of rutin in Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.Table 1 Independent variables and their levels in Box-Behnken design for ﬂavonoids fraction of Tribulus terrestris L leaves.

The solid residue was dissolved with 10 ml of HPLC-grade methanol, and ﬁltered by 0.22 μm micro ﬁltration mem- brane prior to use in LC-MS analysis. 2.5.2.LC-MS2conditions and parameters Flavonoids fraction was separated on a C 18column (Waters platinum series, 250 mm /C24.6 mm, i.d.5 μm) using acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid solution (B) as mobile phase.The procedure of gradient elution was 0% –45% of A for 0 –45 min, and then 45% –0% of A for 45 –50 min with a ﬂow rate of 0.7 ml/min, column temperature 25/C14C, and detection wavelength 350 nm.The operating conditions of HPLC-ESI- MS2were as follows: negative and positive ion modes, automatic sec- ondary mass spectrum scan with the range 50 –1000 m/z, drying gas 12 l/ min and 350/C14C, nebulizer pressure 30 psi, and capillary voltage 3500 V.2.6.Antioxidant activity assay 2.6.1.Measurement of DPPH radical scavenging activity The DPPH radical scavenging activity assay was carried out using the method described by Guo et al.
(2013) with some modi ﬁcations. The volume ratio was 1:9 for sample solution and 0.1 mmol/L DPPH working solution.The antioxidant activity was expressed with IC 50(mg/ml), which is the sample concentration of inhibition 50% free radicals.2.6.2.Measurement of ABTS radical scavenging activity The ABTS radical scavenging activity was measured as the method of Lahouar et al.(2014) with minor modi ﬁcations.The volume ratio of sample solution and ABTS working solution was the same with the method for measurement of DPPH radical scavenging activity.2.6.3.Measurement of ferric-ion reducing antioxidant power Ferric-ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was measured ac- cording to the method of Grifﬁn et al.(2004) with some modi ﬁcations.An aliquot of samples solution was mixed with four times of FRAP re- agent.FRAP was expressed as mmol Fe2þper 100 μg/ml of sample.2.7.Antibacterial activity assay Antibacterial activity was evaluated with micro-well dilution method as described by Tian et al.
(2017) with some modi ﬁcations. Each well of 96-well plate was mixed with 100 μl of sample solution and bacterium solution, and then incubated at 37/C14C for 24 h.Gentamicin and sterile water were used as positive and negative control, respectively, and MIC value was an evaluation index.2.8.Acetic acid-induced writhing response The analgesic activity of ﬂavonoids fraction was determined by acetic acid-induced writhing response ( Perazzo et al., 2013 ;Wang et al., 2013 ).Mice were randomly assigned to ﬁve groups as follows: (1) acetic acid model group: mice were intraperitoneal injection of 0.6% acetic acid (10 ml/kg).(2) positive group: 200 mg/kg of aspirin was intragastrically administrated for three days before the injection of acetic acid.(3 –5) ﬂavonoids fraction of Tribulus terrestris L.leaves treatment groups: ﬂa- vonoids fraction was administered by oral at a dose of 12.5, 25 and 50 g raw medicinal materials (RMM)/kg for ﬁve days before model estab- lishment.
One hour after the intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid, the writhing times was recorded in 20 min.2.9. Xylene induced ear oedema According to the method reported by Shabbir et al.(2018) , the anti-in ﬂammatory activity of ﬂavonoids fraction was evaluated with xylene induced ear oedema model.Mice were intragastrically adminis- trated normal saline, aspirin (0.2 g/kg) and ﬂavonoids fraction of Tribulus terrestris L.leaves with the concentration of 12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg forﬁve days.After 1 h of treatment, two sides of the right ear were smeared with 50 μl of xylene.The weight of two ears was measured after 40 min, and oedema was determined with the difference in right and left ear weight.2.10.Anti-in ﬂammatory activity against RAW 264.7 cells induced by LPS 2.10.1.Cell culture RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modi ﬁed Eagle's Me- dium (DMEM) at 37/C14C in a humidi ﬁed atmosphere with supplemented 5%CO 2.
The culture medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. 2.10.2.Samples solution preparation Flavonoids fraction solution was prepared with the optimized extraction process, and dissolved completely with DMEM medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml.Then, the mixture of ﬂavonoids fraction solution and DMEM medium was ﬁltered, packed, and preserved at -20/C14C for later use.2.10.3.Cell viability assay According to the method reported by Kim et al.(2016) with some modiﬁcations, the cytotoxicity of ﬂavonoids fraction against RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated using the MTT assay.Cells were cultured to a con- centration of 1 /C2105cells/well, and grouped into negative control group, Dex group (2 μmol/L), LPS model group and ﬂavonoids fraction treat- ment group at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 μg/ml.Then, 50 μlo f LPS (5 μg/ml) was added to all the groups except control group with 50 μl of RPMI 1640 medium.
After incubation for 18 h, 20 μl of MTT reagent (5 mg/ml) was supplemented and further culture for 4 h. Then, the super- natant was discarded and the residue was dissolved with 150 μl of DMSO, followed detected by microplate reader detection at 490 nm.2.10.4.Phagocytic activity assay According to the report by Tian et al.(2018) , the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated by neutral red.The cell inoculation density and pretreatment method were the same as cell viability assay.After incubated for 18 h, 100 μl of neutral red solution (100 mg/ml) was mixed and incubated continuely for 30 min.Then, cells were sealed with 100μl of cell lysis solution (ethanol: ice acetic acid ¼1:1, v: v) at room temperature for overnight, and then measured at 540 nm with enzymemarker.2.10.5.NO measurement NO concentration was analyzed by the Griess reagent method with modiﬁcations described by Su et al .(2014) .
The sodium nitrite standard diluents and the supernatant were reacted with isovolumetric of solvent A, which was consisted by 1.0 g of anhydrous sulfanilic acid, 6 ml of 85% phosphoric acid and 94 ml of deionized water, and the reaction solution was incubated at 37 /C14C for 10 min. Then, 50 ml of 0.1% n-naph- thylethylenediamine solution was added, and incubated again at 37/C14C for 10 min.After incubation, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm, and the concentration of NO was calculated from an established sodium nitrite standard curve.2.11.Statistical analysis Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as means /C6standard deviation (SD).The response surfaceC.Tian et al.Heliyon 5 (2019) e02234 3 experiment data were analyzed by using Design Expert 8.0.6 software and the rest of data were analyzed statistically by SPSS 17.0 (SPSS 17.0 for WINDOWS; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
In all statistical analyses, pvalues /C200.05 were regarded as statistically signi ﬁcant and pvalues /C200.01 as very signi ﬁcance. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.The optimization of single factor experiments In this part, the effects of the concentration of ethanol solution, ratio of solvent to material, and ultrasonic extraction time on content of ﬂa- vonoids fraction were evaluated with the single factor experiments, and the results were listed in Fig.1 .In order to optimize the extraction technology of ﬂavonoids fraction, six levels of the three single factors were as follows: 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% for concentration of ethanol solution (X 1), 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 ml/g for ratio of solvent to material (X 2), and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min for ultrasonic extraction time (X 3).In the evaluation of single factor ex- periments, the in ﬂuence of any factor was investigated on the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction, and the other two factors were set to the fourth level.
As can be seen from X 1line chart in Fig. 1 , the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction increased with increasing of the concentration of ethanol solu- tion from 0% to 20%, and the yield reached the highest point at 20%, and then decreased from 20% to 100%.This phenomenon might be due to the polarity of ﬂavonoids fraction in Tribulus terrestris L.leaves was much similar with low concentration of ethanol solvent, namely, the polarity of ﬂavonoid components in is relatively large.This indicated that it was not a positive correlation relation between extraction yield and concentra- tion of ethanol solution.As described in Fig.1 , the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction improved with the increase of ratio of solvent to material (X 2) and ultrasonic extraction time (X 3).X2and X 3line charts all indicated that a higher level presented a better yield of ﬂavonoids fraction.
However, the growth speed of the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction began to slow down with increasing of ratio of solvent to material (X 2) and ultrasonic extraction time (X 3), which can be explained that the competitive inhibition of the impurities was increased with the increasing of ratio of solvent to material (X 2) and ultrasonic extraction time (X 3). According to the results of single factor experiments for extraction of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves, three levels of the three factors were adopted for the RSM experiments as follows in Table 1 : concentration of ethanol solution (10, 20, 30%), ratio of solvent to ma- terial (20, 25, 30 ml/g), and ultrasonic extraction time (20, 25, 30 min).3.2.Optimization of extraction conditions by BBD 3.2.1.Model ﬁtting and statistical analysis As shown in Table 2, 17 experiments were performed for optimization the extraction conditions of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.
leaves in the design matrix, and then the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction was obtained as index. In terms of coded factors, the ﬁnal equation of ﬂavonoids fraction was set up by multiple regression analysis with Design Expert software (version 8.0.6), as follows, Y ¼0.24þ0.018X 1þ0.0075X 2þ0.0075X 3 -0.0075X 1X2þ0.0025X 1X3þ0.0025X 2X3-0.00975X 12þ0.00025 X 22 -0.00975X 32.Table 3 described the analysis of variance for the experimental results of the BBD for ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.The determined coef ﬁcients R2¼0.9824, which was presented by ANOVA of the quadratic regression model, indicated that only 1.76% of total vari- ants cannot be explained by the model.The adjusted R2at 0.9598 sug- gested a better correlation between experimental values and predicted values.In addition, the lower p-value ( p< 0.0001) indicated that the model can signi ﬁcantly represent the actual relationship between pa- rameters and response.
Meanwhile, a lower value of coef ﬁcient of the variation (C.V.) at 1.45 con ﬁrmed a higher degree of precision, accuracy, Fig. 1.Effect of ethanol concentration (X 1,%), ratio of solvent to material (X 2, ml/g) and extraction time (X 3, min) on the extraction yield of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L leaves.Table 3 Analysis of variance of the experimental results of the BBD.

Tian et al.Heliyon 5 (2019) e02234 4 reliability and reproducibility of the model.As listed in Table 3 ,p-value was used to evaluate the statistical sig- niﬁcance of regression coef ﬁcients in equation.
The linear coef ﬁcients of concentration of ethanol solution (X 1), ratio of solvent to material (X 2) and ultrasonic extraction time (X 3) were all very signi ﬁcant ( p<0.01) for the extraction of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L. leaves.In addition, the quadratic coef ﬁcients were very signi ﬁcant in X 12and X 32 with pvalue 0.0006, but there was no signi ﬁcant difference ( p>0.05) for ratio of solvent to material (X 22).The interaction factors were observed very signi ﬁcant between concentration of ethanol solution (X 1), ratio of solvent to material (X 2)(p<0.01).However, there were no statistical signiﬁcance between X 2and X 3,X1and X 3(p>0.05).Each of the experimental values was compared to the predicted value calculated by this model.The results suggested that the model used in this study were able to identify the optimum extraction condition for ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.3.2.2.Graphical interpretation and optimization of procedure Fig.
2 were the 3D response surface curves showing the effects of concentration of ethanol solution (X 1), ratio of solvent to material (X 2) and ultrasonic extraction time (X 3) on the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction. The interactions among concentration of ethanol solution, ratio of sol- vent to material and ultrasonic extraction time, along with the effects of these three variables and their mutual interaction on the yield of ﬂavo- noids fraction were depicted in Fig.2 .From Fig.2 a to c, it can be seen that the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction was improved with the increase of each of the three factors in a certain range, and the intensive contour and steeper surface of concentration of ethanol solution suggested that con- centration of ethanol solution has a higher in ﬂuence on the yield of ﬂa- vonoids fraction than ratio of solvent to material and ultrasonic extraction time.
Theﬁnal equation for ﬂavonoids fraction obtained in this research, was applied for response surface optimization using Design-Expert soft- ware. The optimal extraction parameters for ﬂavonoids fraction were list as follows: the concentration of ethanol solution 25.87%, ratio of solvent to material 30:1 ml/g, and ultrasonic extraction time 27.93 min.Triple experiments were performed under these optimized conditions, and the yield of ﬂavonoids fraction was 0.27%, which was almost identical to predicted results at 0.26%, indicating a good correspondence between experimental and predicated values.The suitability of the model equa- tion for predicting the optimum response values was veri ﬁed using the optimal condition.3.3.Chemical component analysis of ﬂavonoids fraction The chemical components present in the ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves, were separated and analyzed by HPLC-DAD- ESI-MS2.As shown in Fig.
3 , the chromatogram was recorded with a higher signal at 350 nm Table 4 described the data of exact mass for MS or MS2fragmentation obtained from their mass spectra.
In this research, 14 compounds, including (1) quercetin-3,7 diglucoside þGlc, (2) quercetin-3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, (3) quercetin-3-O- arabinosyl galactoside, (4) isorhamnetin-3-glucoside þXyl, (5) quercetin-3,7 diglucoside þXyl, (6) quercetin-3-O-(2,6- α-L-dirhamnopyranosyl- β-D- glucopyrano- side, (7) kaempferol-glucosyl-(1 →2)-rhamnoside, (8) quercetin-3-O- β- (2(G)-O- β- xylopyranosyl-6(G)-O- α-rhamnopyranosyl) glucopyranoside, (9) quercetin 3- gentiobioside, (10) kaempferol-3- gentiobioside, (11) isoquercitrin, (12) 26-O- β-D- glucopyranosyl-(25R)- 5α-furostan-12-one-3 β,2 2α, 26-triol-3-O- β-D- glucopyranosyl -(1 →4)- β-D-galactopyranoside, (13) luteolin-7-O- β-D-glucoside and (14) apige- nin -6,8 glucoside þXyl, were characterized tentatively by literatures (Feng et al., 2016 ;Pereira et al., 2012 ;Zheng et al., 2017 ).
The derivative of disaccharide or monosaccharide could be inferred indirectly by the difference value of molecular weight for the two frag- ments in the MS2spectra and the related literature information ( Feng etal., 2016 ;Pereira et al., 2012 ;Zheng et al., 2017 ). Compounds 11, 12 and 16 with high content will be used as analysis objects for component identi ﬁcation and analysis.In ESI/C0mode, compound 11, which was quercetin 3-gentiobioside with calculated mass 626, produced a depro- tonated molecular ion at m/z 625 [M-H]-and fragment ion at m/z300.For compound 12 kaempferol-3- gentiobioside, the characteristic frag- ment ion at m/z285 was observed because of losing of gentiobioside at m/z 325 from the parent ion 625 [M-H]-.Compound 13 produced a [M-H]-ion at m/z581, and then the major fragment ion was obtained at m/z463, which was apigenin aglycone fallen the disaccharide from the parent ion apigenin-6,8 glucoside þXyl.
In addition, two unknown compounds with molecular weight 728 and 798, were not identi ﬁed by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS2, and will be analyzed in future studies. This study focused on inference the major components in the extract, and selection the ingredients with better content for further structural con ﬁrmation and analysis.However, the exact structure of hexose or aglycon from disaccharides derivatives, will be analyzed, inferred and identi ﬁed with structural fragments from LC-MSnmore than MS2in the future.These studies will provide a foundation for the research on the quality control and pharmacological mechanism for ﬂavonoids fractrion from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.3.4.Antioxidant activity Table 5 exhibited the antioxidant activities of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves against DPPH and ABTS free radicals, and ferric ion.Flavonoids can display a better antioxidant activity due to the multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups in the structure.
Flavonoids extract from mimenghua exhibited a better antioxidant activities demonstrated by scavenging capabilities of DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, reducing power and total antioxidant capacity ( Guo et al., 2013 ). The antioxidant activities of ﬂavonoids fraction were evaluated with IC50 DPPH 10.47 μg/ml and IC 50 ABTS 7.99 μg/ml, which were both lower than the control of BHT (IC 50 DPPH , 8.17 μg/ml; IC 50 ABTS , 2.31 μg/ml).However, FRAP of ﬂavonoids fraction was 0.12 mmol Fe2þ/100 μg/ml almost the same as BHT with 0.14 mmol Fe2þ/100 μg/ml.Therefore, ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves shown a mild anti- oxidant activity and may be a very interesting candidate for the research and development of natural, environmental and healthy antioxidant for the pharmaceutical and food industries.3.5.Antibacterial activity Many studies have shown that ﬂavonoids have antibacterial activity.
Liquiritin expressed a stronger antibacterial effect with IC 50of 198.6 μg/ ml than liquiritigenin with IC 50of 337.8 μg/ml against E. coli , and liq- uiritin might be a promising candidate ( Kong et al., 2015 ).The antibacterial activities of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus ter- restris L.leaves against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella (ATCC 51812), Staphyloccocus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Streptococcus (ATCC 49619), were listed in Table 6 , and gentamicin was used as a positive control for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of assay method.As shown in Table 6 , the inhibition effect of gentamicin was measured with MIC values ranged from 0.5 μg/ml to 2.0 μg/ml against Escherichia coli , Salmonella ,Staphyloccocus aureus andStreptococcus , which was in accor- dance with the related requirements of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
In addition, ﬂavonoids fraction exhibited a stranger antibac- terial effect on gram-positive bacteria (MIC, 0.25 g RMM/ml) than gram- negative bacteria (MIC, 1.0 g RMM/ml). The results suggested that ﬂa- vonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves was a candidate drugs for replacing or decreasing of antibiotic application in diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria.In the further research, we will study the anti- bacterial activity of main ﬂavonoid compounds from ﬂavonoids fraction, which will be an important foundation for the screening of new anti- bacterial drugs.C.Tian et al.Heliyon 5 (2019) e02234 5 Fig.2.(a–c) Response surface plots of ethanol concentration (X 1,%), ratio of solvent to material (X 2, ml/g) and extraction time (X 3, min) on the extraction yield of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L leaves.C.Tian et al.Heliyon 5 (2019) e02234 6 3.6.
Analgesic activity Intragastric administration of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg of total ﬂavonoids from Sanguis draxonis can alleviate signi ﬁcantly spared nerve injury- induced mechanical hypersensitivity by reducing the level of NO, NOS,TNF- ɑand IL-1 β, upregulation the level of IL-10, and inhibition the expression of FGFR3, GFAP and p-CREB in the spinal dorsal horn ( Chen et al., 2015 ). The analgesic activity of ﬂavonoids fraction (12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg) from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves was evaluated with writhing response of mice induced by 0.6% acetic acid, and the writhing times were eval- uation index.As described in Fig.4 , the writhing times decreased very signiﬁcantly ( p/C200.01) in the aspirin group compared to the control group, which was indicating that the pain model was established suc-cessfully and can be used for evaluation the analgesic effect of ﬂavonoids fraction.
In addition, 12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg of ﬂavonoids fraction decreased writhing times with a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the aspirin group, 25 g RMM/kg of ﬂavonoids fraction exhibited similar Fig.3.Chromatographic pro ﬁle of HPLC-MS at 350 nm for ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.Table 4 Chemical compositions of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.No.

Anti-in ﬂammatory activity in vivo Rutin can treat vascular in ﬂammatory diseases by suppressing the production of TNF- αand activation of NF- κB(Lee et al., 2016 ). Moreover, rutin also can attenuate in ﬂammation induced by cyclophosphamide through down regulate the content of in ﬂammatory markers, such as TNF- α, IL-6 and expressions of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF- κB, i-NOS and COX-2 ( Nafees et al., 2015 ).To investigate the anti-in ﬂammatory activities of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves in vivo , the ear swelling was selected as inﬂammatory model induced by xylene in mice.According to the results shown in Fig.6 , the ear swelling degree (mg) decreased very signi ﬁcantly (p/C200.01) in the aspirin group compared to the control group.Moreover, 12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg of ﬂavonoids fraction can reduce the swelling degree in a dose-dependent manner.
The anti-in ﬂammatory activities of 12.5 and 50 g RMM/kg of ﬂavonoids fraction exhibited very signi ﬁcantlyTable 5 IC50and FRAP values for evaluated antioxidant assays of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L. leaves.Sample IC 50 DPPH (μg/ ml)IC50 ABTS (μg/ ml)FRAP (mmol Fe2þ/100 μg/ml) Flavonoids fraction10.47 7.99 0.12 BHT 8.17 2.31 0.14 IC50, 50% of inhibition concentration.Table 6 MIC values of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves against path- ogenic bacteria (Mean /C6SD;n¼3).Sample Escherichia coli(ATCC 25922)Salmonella (ATCC51812)Staphyloccocus aureus (ATCC 25923)Streptococcus (ATCC 49619) Gentamicin ( μg/ml)2.00/C60.02 0.50 /C60.01 0.50 /C60.01 1.00 /C60.01 Flavonoids fraction (gRMM/ml)1.00/C60.03 1.00 /C60.03 0.25 /C60.04 0.25 /C60.04 Fig.4.Effects of different concentrations of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves on writhing times induced by 0.6% acetic acid in mice.
Mice were pretreated with ﬂavonoids (12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg) for ﬁve days, followed by 0.6% acetic acid stimulation. Values represent the mean /C6SD of the three in- dependent experiments (#compared with the control group, *compared with Asipirin treatment group, */#p<0.05, **/##p<0.01).Fig.5.Effects of different concentrations of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves on inhibition ratio (%) induced by 0.6% acetic acid in mice.Mice were pretreated with ﬂavonoids (12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg) for ﬁve days, followed by 0.6% acetic acid stimulation.Values represent the mean /C6SD of the three in- dependent experiments (*compared with Asipirin treatment group, * p<0.05, ** p<0.01).C.Tian et al.Heliyon 5 (2019) e02234 8 (p/C200.01) and signi ﬁcantly ( p/C200.05) comparing to the aspirin group, and there was no signi ﬁcant difference between 25 g RMM/kg of ﬂavo- noids fraction and signi ﬁcant aspirin group ( p>0.05).
25 g RMM/kg of ﬂavonoids fraction exhibited similar anti-in ﬂammatory effect to aspirin, and 50 g RMM/kg of ﬂavonoids fraction revealed stronger anti- inﬂammatory activity. In addition, there was a similar trends in inhibi- tion ratio (%), which was illustrated in Fig.7 .The research has demon- strated that the ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves exhibits a good anti-in ﬂammatory activity in vivo, which will provide an important basis for the research and development of anti-in ﬂammatoryChinese medicine in clinic.3.8.Anti-in ﬂammatory activity in vitro 3.8.1.Effect of TFE on the cell viability Cytotoxic effect of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves on RAW 264.7 cells was measured by MTT assay.Cells were incubated withﬂavonoids fraction at the concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 μg/ml after pretreated with LPS or medium.As described in Fig.
8 , the results indicated that cell viabilitity was not signi ﬁcantly ( p>0.05) affected by ﬂavonoids fraction in the experimental concentration range from 50 to 200 μg/ml, namely, the experimental concentration of ﬂavonoids frac- tion is safe for RAW 264.7 cells. 3.8.2.Effect of TFE on the phagocytic activity Flavonoids can play biological roles by binding to a variety of re- ceptors on the surface of macrophages and activation different signaling pathways, and then enhance the phagocytic activity, promote the secretion of related cytokines, and stimulate the secretion of related in- ﬂammatory cytokines by macrophages.Compared with LPS model group, 20, 50 and 100 μM of rutin can reduce the phagocytic activity very signiﬁcantly (p <0.01), and there was no signi ﬁcant (p >0.05) for 20 μM of rutinand Dex ( Tian et al., 2019 ).
Cells were pretreated with 50, 100 and 200 μg/ml of ﬂavonoids fraction for 1 h, followed by LPS (1 μg/ml) stimulation for 18 h, and then incubated with 100 μl of neutral red solution (100 mg/ml) for 30 min. As shown in Fig.9 , it was found that phagocytosis increased signi ﬁcantly ( p <0.01) after the LPS-induced comparing to the control group, which was revealed that the experiment model was established successfully.Moreover, ﬂavonoids fraction can reduce phagocytosis signi ﬁcantly ( p< Fig.6.Effects of different concentrations of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves on ear swelling degree induced by xylene in mice.Mice were pretreated with ﬂavonoids (12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg) for ﬁve days, followed by xylene stimulation.Values represent the mean /C6SD of the three independent experiments (*compared with Asipirin treatment group, * p<0.05, **p<0.01).Fig.7.Effects of different concentrations of ﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.

Mice were pretreated with ﬂavonoids (12.5, 25 and 50 g RMM/kg) for ﬁve days, followed by xylene stimulation.Values represent the mean /C6SD of the three independent experiments (#compared with the control group, *compared with Asipirin treatment group, */#p<0.05, **/##p<0.01).Fig.8.Effect of ﬂavonoids fraction (FF) on the viability of RAW 264.7 cells.Cells were cultured with FF (50, 100 and 200 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ ml LPS for 18 h; then, cell viability was measured by MTT assay.Data are presented as means /C6SD of three independent experiments.C.Tian et al.Heliyon 5 (2019) e02234 9 0.01) compared with the LPS treatment group in a dose-dependent manner.In addition, it was exciting that the 100 and 200 μg/ml of ﬂa- vonoids fraction exhibited much better inhibition of phagocytic activity than Dex, which will be an important enlightening effect on the follow-up study.3.8.3.
Effect of TFE on the content of NO As a major in ﬂammatory molecule, NO plays an essential role in the regulation of in ﬂammation. 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 μM of rutin can decrease ( p<0.01) the content of NO with a dose-dependent manner compared with LPS model group, and the inhibitory effect of 100 μMo f rutin was stronger than Dex ( p<0.01), and 5 –50μM of rutin was equivalent to Dex ( p>0.05), which suggested that low concentration of rutin can play the same role as Dex in reducing the content of in ﬂam- matory medium NO ( Tian et al., 2019 ).According to the results in Fig.10 , the content of NO was improved very signi ﬁcantly ( p< 0.01) in LPS group comparing to the control group; and compared with the LPS group, ﬂavonoids fraction groups were all very signi ﬁcantly ( p< 0.01) decreased with a dose-dependent manner in the experimental groups pretreated by the concentration of 50, 100 and 200 μg/ml.
Compared with dexamethasone, the inhibition effect of ﬂavonoids fraction was a little weaker. However, there was more attention to the characteristics of low toxicity, less residue and no resistance of Traditional Chinese medicine.4.Conclusion This study focused on the extraction technology, component analysis, and antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic and anti-in ﬂammatory activities ofﬂavonoids fraction from Tribulus terrestris L.leaves.The extraction process of ﬂavonoids fraction was optimized by single factor experiment and response surface method, and the maximum extraction yield wasachieved with the concentration of ethanol solution 25.87%, ratio of solvent to material 30:1 ml/g, and ultrasonic extraction time 27.93 min.Moreover, 14 compositions were preliminarily identi ﬁed from ﬂavonoids fraction by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS2.
In addition, ﬂavonoids fraction exhibi- ted a better antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic and anti-in ﬂammatory activities, and will be a potential candidate drug for further research and development of new, healthy and nature herbal medicine for food and pharmaceutical industries.
