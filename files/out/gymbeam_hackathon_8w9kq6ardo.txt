Vitamin E alleviates glyphosate-based herbicide-induced progesterone secretion inhibition and oxidative stress increase in chicken primary granulosa cells Fr/C19eville Mathias, Bernardi Oph /C19elie, Ram /C19e Christelle, Froment Pascal , and Dupont Jo €elle1 CNRS, IFCE, INRAE Animal Physiology Department, Universit /C19e de Tours, PRC, F-37380, Nouzilly, France ABSTRACT Glyphosate-based herbicides ( GBH ) are the most extensively used herbicides worldwide.Despitea presumed nondangerousness for animals, several stud-ies reported negative effects after a GBH exposure inseveral animal models including birds, notably on repro- ductive functions.Several studies concerning the advan- tages of Vitamin E ( VE) for antioxidant activity but also growth and reproduction have been reported inbirds.However, it remains unclear whether VE couldalleviate the negative effect of GBHs on chicken ovariancells.
Here we exposed chicken primary granulosa cells(GCs ) from F1 and F3/4 follicles to growing doses of GBH (0.036, 0.36, 3.6, and 36 gly eq/L), with or without VE supplementation (1 mg/L) and investigated cell via- bility, proliferation, oxidative stress and steroidogenesis.GBH exposure did not affect F1 and F3 GCs viabilitybut it increased cell proliferation only in F1 GCs and this effect was not altered by VE. In both F1 and F3/4GCs, GBH exposure increased total oxidant status(TOS ), reduced total antioxidant status ( TAS ) and consequently increased index of oxidative stress ( OSI) in dose dependent manner.This latter effect for GBH 36 mg eq gly/L was totally abolished in response to VE.In both F1 and F3/4 GCs, GBH exposure reduced pro-gesterone secretion in a dose dependent manner and thiseffect with GBH 0.36 and 1.8 mg eq glyphosate/L wasalleviated by VE.However, we did not observe anyeffect of GBH and VE on the gene expression of severalcomponents of the steroidogenesis process.
Taken together, these results show that GBH may have endo- crine disruptor effects, and that these effects might bealleviated by antioxidant VE supplementation.

However, Gly alone is not able to exert its full herbicide power, and needs other co- formulants (called surfactants) which act as wettingagents and allow Gly to better penetrate plant systems(Bradberry et al., 2004 ). The combination of Gly and of these co-formulants is called a GBH, and GBHs are theproducts which are actually spread on crops.It thereforeseems more relevant to consider whole GBH formula-tions when assessing Gly ’s toxicity on animals, as Gly alone is less likely to reach them than GBH formation.Glyphosate, and by extension GBHs are also very sus- pected to act as endocrine disruptors ( ED) in several models, which also fuels the controversy surroundingtheir use.According to the World Health Organization,“an endocrine disruptor ”is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function(s) of the endocrine systemand consequently causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub)populations ”.
Exposure to ED occurs via ingestion, inhalation and der-mal absorption ( Ingaramo et al., 2020 ). In a review pub- lished in 2021, Mu~noz et al., 2021 draw up a state of the art of the studies investigating the possible ED nature ofGly.A previous study shows that a GBH administrationcan disturb steroidogenesis step limiting StAR proteinin MA-10 cells ( Walsh et al., 2000 ).Furthermore, it can be associated to an increase in the oxidative stress in vitro in different cell types including bovine embryo (Dovolou et al., 2024 ) and in vivo in various tissues and species such as chicken testis ( Ren et al., 2018 ) and mice liver mice ( Qi et al., 2023 ).Glyphosate has been reported to cause mitochondrial dysfunctions in differ-ent models such as C.Elegans ( Bailey et al., 2018 ), pig oocyte ( Xing et al., 2022 ), and danio brain ( Pereira et al., 2018 ).
Studies have already investigated the impact of GBHs or Gly on mammalian granulosa cells ( GC) (Perego et al., 2017 ;Gigante et al., 2018 ;Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ) but no data are yet available in avian species. In caprine GCs, Vitamin E ( VE) is able to alleviate the negative effects of GBHs ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ,2022).Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble vitamin that acts as a natu-ral antioxidant ( Gibaldi, 1996 ).It has several critical functions in animals, including protecting cells alongside the harmful properties of irritable oxygen species andpromoting humoral and cellular immune responses.Inchicken, VE supplementation in broiler diets improves production parameters (body weight and feed ef ﬁciency) without negatively affecting the health.In a previous study, we chronically dietary exposed 32 wk-old hens to a dose of GBH of 47 mg/kg bw/d, whichis close to half the No Observed Adverse Level(NOAEL ) determined by EFSA in birds.
The maximal blood plasma Gly concentration monitored was1.5 mg/L ( Fr/C19eville et al., 2022 ). Here, we assessed the impact of the GBHs from 0.036 to 36 mg of Gly equiva- lent/L on GCs viability, proliferation, oxidative stressand steroidogenesis after 24 h of exposure.Consideringthat the induction of an oxidative stress is probably themost described effect of GBH ( Wang et al., 2022 ), we added 1 mg/L of VE in the culture medium to determinea possible alleviation of the GBH impacts in chicken GC.Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of growing doses of a GBH on chicken primary GCs functions and the potential effect of VE (1 mg/L)on the GBHs effects.MATERIAL AND METHODS Animals and Ethical Issues Fifty female broilers 26 wk-old of the commercial ROSS 308 breed (Hendrix Genetics, Saint Laurent de laPlaine, France) were reared at “P^ole Exp /C19erimental Avi- cole de Tours ”(INRAE, Nouzilly, France) according to the standard breeding conditions.
Animals were dividedin groups of 5 in 10 pens, each pen with an area of 3 m2 and with thermostatically controlled air inlets and a dynamic cross-ventilation system. The animals wereexposed to 15 h of light per day at 23 wk to induce thelaying and they were maintained under this light regimeuntil the end of the experiment.All animals received arestricted diet according to Hendrix Genetics recommen-dation.The composition of the diet (%) was (corn:54.19; wheat: 8; Soybean meal: 13.95; Soy oil: 2; Sun- ﬂower oil: 5.8; Sodium Bicarbonate: 0.1; Calcium car- bonate: 6.6; Phosphate: 2.2; Salt: 0.28; Methionine DL:0.05; Mineral premix: 0.5; and Soybean: 6.33).Ovarianfollicles have been collected during meat processing aslocal abattoir by-products by highly quali ﬁed and expe- rienced laboratory staff.Thus, according to the ethicalissues for the protection of animals, this project does notrequire the consent of the competent ethics committee for animal experiments.
Isolation of Chicken GC After electronarcosis, the ovaries were immediately removed and placed in ice-cold sterile 1% NaCl salinesolution for immediate use. GCs from the ﬁrst (F1 = the largest follicle size), third and fourth (F3 and F4) largesthierarchical follicles were dissected as previouslydescribed ( Tosca et al., 2006 ;Chabrolle et al., 2007 ).GCs from F3 and F4 follicle were pooled into 1 single group, hereinafter called F3/4 group.They were pre- pared for culture by being dispersed in 0.3% collagenase2 MATHIAS ET AL.type A (Roche Diagnostic, Meylan, France) in F12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ).Cells were recovered by centrifugation (10 min, 800 g at roomtemperature) washed with fresh medium, and countedin a haemocytometer.The viability of F1 −F3/4 GCs was estimated by trypan blue exclusion at about 95%.The culture medium was DMEM supplemented with100U/ml penicillin, 100mg/l streptomycin, 3mmol/l L-glutamine and 5% FBS.
Cells were initially cultured for 24h with no treatment, then incubated in fresh cul- ture medium with or without test reagents for the appro-priate time. All of the cultures were maintained in awater-saturated atmosphere of 95% air:5% CO 2at 37°C.Chemicals Gallup Super 360, hereinafter called GBH was obtained from Axereal (Monnaie, France).It contains360 g/L of glyphosate (485.8 g/L of isopropylaminesalt).Human recombinant IGF-1 was obtained fromSigma Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).Puri-ﬁed ovine luteinizing hormone ( LH) (lot 26) was obtained from Dr AF Parlow and the National Hormone and Pituitary Programme (Bethesda, MD).Vitamin E (VE, a-tocopherol acetate) was provided by Sigma- Aldrich (Saint Quentin-Fallavier, France).Cell Viability GCs were treated in 96 wells plates with several dilutions of GBH; 0.036, 0.36, 3.6, and 36 mg gly eq/L and CT (0 mggly eq/L) for 24 h, with or without addition of VE (1 mg/L).
Cell viability was determi ned using a Cell Counting Kit- 8(CCK8 ) assay commercial kit (Sigma −Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) . The assay was performed according to the manufacturer recommendations.Absor-bances were measured at a 450 nm wavelength using a spec- trophotometer.Four biologica l replicates were created for each concentration (n = 4) and the assay was performed4 times to obtain 4 statistical replicates (N = 4).Cell Proliferation GCs were treated in 96 wells plates with several dilu- tions of GBH; 0.036, 0.36, 3.6 and 36 mg gly eq/L andCT (0 mg gly eq/L) for 24 h, with or without addition ofVE (1 mg/L).Cell proliferation was determined using aBRDU ELISA assay (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fal-lavier).Absorbances were measured at a 405 and492 nm wavelength using a spectrophotometer.Theassay was performed according to the manufacturer rec- ommendations.
Four biological replicates were created for each concentration (n = 4) and the assay was per-formed 4 times to obtain 4 statistical replicates (N = 4). TAS, TOS and OSI Determination TAS (total antioxidant status) was determined using a commercial kit supplied by Randox (Crumlin, UK)according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.In this method, metmyoglobin is converted into ferrylmyoglo- bin in the presence of iron ions.The result of the reactionbetween ferrylmyoglobin with the Randox ABTSreagent was a green product, the absorbance of whichwas measured at 600 nm.The TOS (total oxidant sta-tus) was determined using the commercial kit Per-OXTOS/TOC (Immune Diagnostics, Bensheim, Germany).The reaction of peroxidase with lipid hydroperoxides led to the production of reduced phospholipid products of green color, which changes to yellow upon addition ofthe stop reagent.Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.The index of oxidative stress ( OSI) was calculated based on the formula = TOS/TAS £100.
Progesterone Assay Progesterone concentration in hen GCs was deter- mined in serum-free media after culturing for 24h in thepresence or absence of different doses of GBH; CT (0 mggly eq/L), 0.036, 0.36, 3.6 and 36 mg gly eq/L with orwithout vitamin E (1 mg/L), and/or LH (10 /C08M), and/ or IGF (10/C08M) for 24 h. Initially, granulosa were grown in 48-well dishes (1.25 £105viable cells/250 ml medium per well) in DMEM and 5% FBS for 24h.After over- night serum starvation, GCs were incubated with theappropriate treatment for 24h.The concentration ofprogesterone derived from hen GCs, in the culture mediawas measured using an ELISA protocol as previouslydescribed ( Can /C19epa et al., 2008 ).The intra-assay coef ﬁ- cient of variation ( CV) averaged <10%.The results are expressed as the amount (mean §s.e.m.) of steroid (ng/ ml)/ 100 mg of total protein secreted per 24h.There were 4 replicates for each treatment within each culture, andwe performed 4 cultures.
In each culture, we used 4hens, and consequently we used a pool of GCs from 4 fol-licles of the same category (GC from 1 follicle per hen). Measurement of Steroidogenesis Transcripts Expressions in GC GC were treated in 6 wells plates with several dilu- tions of GBH; 0.036, and 36 mg gly eq/L and CT (0 mggly eq/L) (n = 6) for 24 h, with and without vitamin Esupplementation (1mg/L).Total RNA was extractedfrom each well using TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagentsand an Ultra-Turrax instrument for grinding, accordingto the manufacturer ’s recommendations (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France).The purity and concentrations of the obtained RNA were checked via their A260/A280 ratios using a Nanodropmachine.
cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptionof 2mg of the total RNA in 20 mL of a mix containing each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dATP, dTTP,dGTP, dCTP; 0.5 mM), 2 M RT Buffer, 15 mg/mL oli- godT, 0.125 U of ribonuclease inhibitor and 0.05 U ofMoloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV ); the mixture was kept for 1 h at 37°C. Quan- titative PCR was performed using a mix of 3 mLo fVITAMIN E AND PESTICIDES IN CHICKEN GRANULOSA CELLS 3 cDNA and 8 mL of SYBR Green Supermix 1X Reagent (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) with 250 nM ofspeci ﬁc primers (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Ville- bon-sur-Yvette, France) given in Table 1 .Samples were set up in duplicate in a 384-well plate and a MyiQ CycleDevice (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) was usedto apply the following procedure: incubation (2 min at50°C), denaturation (10 min at 95°C) and 40 PCR cycles (30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C, 30 s at 72°C).
Relative expression of genes was related to the geometric mean ofthe expression of 3 reference genes ( GAPDH [glyceralde- hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase], actin B [ ACTB ]and EEF1 a[eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha]). Primer efﬁciency was calculated using a 5 points serial dilution for each gene, applying the formula E = 10 /C01/slope value.Primer ef ﬁciencies were ranged between 1.85 and 2.00.For each target gene, expression was calculated accord- ing to primer ef ﬁciency ( E) and quanti ﬁcation cycle (Cq), where expression = E/C0Cq.Then, relative expres- sion of the target gene to the 3 reference genes was ana-lyzed according to the 4Cq method.Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism (version 10) was used for each statis- tical test and graph generation.Data are presented asmean §SEM.
One-way ANOVA followed by Dunn pair-wise comparison tests was performed to detect sta-tistical differences between control and different concen- trations of GBH in the absence or in the presence of LH and/or IGF-1 and without addition of VE. In the pres-ence of VE, a student t test was used for the control anddifferent concentrations of GBH except for Figure 6 where a 1-way ANOVA followed by Dunn pair-wisecomparison tests was used to detect if the LH and/orIGF-1 effect on progesterone secretion was altered.Sig-niﬁcant differences compared to control condition iden- tiﬁed by 1-way ANOVA ( Figure 6 ) are indicated by lowercase letters, and signi ﬁcant differences identi ﬁed by student T test are indicated by stars.* P<0.05, ** P <0.01, ***, P<0.001, **** P<0.0001.
RESULTS Effect of GBH Exposure With or Without VE Supplementation in Chicken F1 and F3/4 GCViability As shown in Figure 1 , GBH exposure for 24 h did not affect cell viability whatever the concentration used(0.036 to 36 mg Gly eq/L) in both F1 ( A) and F3/4 ( B) GC. Similar data were obtained after the addition of VE(1 mg/L) whatever the GBH concentration (0.36 and1.8 mg eq/L) exposure for 24 h in both F1 ( C) and F3/4 (D) GCs.( Figures 1C and 1 D).Effect of GBH Exposure With or Without VE Supplementation in Chicken F1 and F3/4 GCProliferation As shown in Figure 2A , GBH exposure (24 h) increased cell proliferation from concentration of 0.036until 36 mg of Gly eq /L in F1 GCs whereas it did notaffect F3/4 granulosa cell proliferation as compared tothe control ( Figure 2B ).The addition of VE increased F1 granulosa cell proliferation in control condition whereas it did signi ﬁcantly modify the effect of GBH at 0.36 or 1.8 mg Gly eq/L ( Figure 2C ).
In F3/4 GC, VE supplementation did not alter cell proliferation in con-trol condition and after 1.8 mg Gly eq/L of GBH expo-sure whereas it decreased number of proliferative cells inresponse to 0.36 mg Gly eq/L of GBH ( Figure 2D ). Effect of GBH Exposure With or Without VE Supplementation in Chicken F1 and F3/4 onTOS, TAS and OSI In both F1 ( Figures 3A −C) and F3/4 ( Figures 4A −C) GCs, GBH exposure increased the TOS, decreased theTAS and increased the OSI from 3.6 mg of Gly eq/mL ina dose dependent manner.Furthermore, the addition of vitamin E decreased TOS, increased TAS and decreased OSI in absence and in response to exposure to GBH atconcentrations of 1.8 and 36 mg Gly eq/L in both F1(Figures 3D −F) and F3/4 GCs ( Figures 4D −F).Inter- estingly, VE reduced by 4 -fold OSI in response to GBHat 36 mg Gly eq/L whereas it decreased it by only bytwice in the absence or in the presence of GBH 1.8 mgGly eq/L in both F1 and F3/4 GCs.

As shown in Figures 5C and6C, GBH exposure (0.36 and 1.8 mg Gly eq/L) decreased not only in basal condition but also in response to LH or/and IGF-1 and this inhibitory effect was totally or strongly reduced after the addition of VE(Figures 5D and6D) in both F1 and F3/4 GCs. We next determined whether the effects of GBH and VE on progesterone secretion by F1 and F3/4 granulosacould be due to variations in mRNA expression of ste-roidogenesis factor (StAR, the cholesterol carrier) orenzymes (HSD3 band CYP11A1).However, as shown in Figure 7 , neither GBH nor VE did signi ﬁcantly affect the expression of the steroidogenesis components in F1(Figure 7A ) and F3/4 ( Figure 7B ) GC.DISCUSSION Chicken is easily exposed to GBH through their diet and we previously observed that Gly accumulates inyolk ( Estienne et al., 2022 ).GCs are a main component of the chicken follicle that are close to the yolk- ﬁlled oocyte suggesting that Gly exposure in yolk could affect the follicular development.
GBH can induce theproduction of ROS and decrease SOD, CAT, and GST activities, as demonstrated on caprine GC in a previousstudy ( Bhardwaj et al., 2022 ;Wang et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, VE ’s ability to scavenge peroxyl radical, most likely by the donation an hydrogen atom, has been described in previous studies ( Traber and Atkinson, 2007).Therefore, VE could reduce TOS and increase TAS by neutralizing oxidant molecules.Thus, GBHcould modulate the expression of several hormones,including progesterone according to the animal model,the age, the sex and the physiological status ( Serra et al., 2021b ).However, few works exploring the ability of GBHs to disturb reproductive functions have been per- formed in avian species.Serra et al.
(2021a ) showed that a GBH enriched diet (46.8 mg gly eq/kg bw/d) increasesplasma testosterone and estradiol levels in roosters,while an exposure to 160 mg gly eq /kg bw/d of GBHdecreased plasma testosterone levels in Japanese quail(Ruuskanen et al., 2020 ). The mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying these effects remain unclear, butalterations in signaling pathways such as ER a, VEGFR2, pERK and PI3K (p85) have been reported in hormone responsive cells ( Mu~noz et al., 2021 ).In the present study, we showed for the ﬁrst time that 1 GBH increased oxidative stress and decreased progesteronesecretion in chicken preovulatory F1 and F3/4 GCs Figure 3.(A) Total oxidant status (TOS) in primary granulosa cells (GCs) from F1 follicles after a 24-h exposure to growing doses of GBH ranging from 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT) to 36 mg of gly eq/L(N (number of experiment) = 4, n (number of replicates per experiment) = 4).

(C) Oxidative stress index (TOS/TAS) in primary GCs from F1 follicles after a 24-h exposure to grow- ing doses of GBH ranging from 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT) to 36 mg of gly eq/L (N = 4, n = 4).(D) TOS, (E) TAS and Oxidative stress index (TOS/TAS) in primary GCs from F1 follicles after a 24-h exposure to doses of GBH of 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT), 0.36 and 1.8 mg of gly eq/Lwith or without addition of vitamin E (VE, 1 mg/L) (N = 4, n = 4).Signi ﬁcant differences as compared to the control (CT, A, B and C) identi ﬁed by 1-way ANOVA or to without VE condition for each GBH concentration identi ﬁed by student T test (D, E and F) are indicated by stars.* P< 0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001, **** P<0.0001.6 MATHIAS ET AL.without any cytotoxic effect.
Furthermore, we demon- strated that VE was able to alleviate some of these nega-tive effects. We showed that a GBH exposure did not affect the cell viability in F1 and F3/4 GC whereas it increased and did not alter F1 and F3/4 GCs cell proliferation, respectively.Thus, we can conclude that a GBH expo-sure until 36 mg Gly Eq/L was not cytotoxic for chickenGC.These data are important because GC play a deci-sive role in follicular development and a GBH exposurecould inhibit this process.Furthermore, GC differentia-tion regulates the initiation of primordial follicles.Ourresult is different from those obtained in bovine GC since Perego et al., 2017 showed that Round up exposure at 10 and 300 mg/L strongly decreased cell numbers.How-ever, other studies showed that Gly induced cell prolifer-ation in glioblastoma cells ( Bianco et al., 2023 ) and GBH increased the growth of rat uterine subepithelialstroma cells ( Zanardi et al., 2024 ).
In our study, we showed that the GBH increased cell proliferation in F1and not F3/4 GC suggesting that the effect of GBH on the preovulatory granulosa cell toxicity could be depen- dent not only the species but also on the differentiationfollicle status. Indeed, in mature hen, the preovulatoryfollicles show a hierarchy according to their size (F5/6to F1) ( Etches and Petitte, 1990 ).The largest follicle (F1), ﬁlled of yolk is ﬁrst to ovulate, followed by the sec- ond largest follicle (F2) approximately 24 to 26 h laterand this continues down the hierarchy.In the present study, we showed that the GBH exposure reduced progesterone secretion in basal state from 0.36 mg of Gly eq/L but also in response to LHand/or IGF-1 in both F1 and F3/4 GCs.These dataare in good agreement with other studies includingbovine GC ( Perego et al., 2024 ;f o rr e v i e w Kaboli Kafshgiri et al., 2022 ;Serra et al., 2021b ) showing that Gly alone or GBH inhib ited steroidogenesis.
However, Gigante et al., ob served that Gly increased progesterone secretion by porcine GCs whereas Gane- san et al. (2020) indicated no in vivo effect on ovar- ian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis.Thus, theeffect of Gly and GBHs are very controversial inmammals.This difference may be due to the differenteffect of glyphosate on granulosa cells and steroido-genesis in in vivo studies compared to in vitro studies.The use of an in vitro model allowed to better target the desired cells, to control the experimental parame- ters and to minimize biological variations.Still, theobtained results should be con ﬁrmed in vivo experi- ments in the future.Figure 4.(A) Total oxidant status (TOS) in primary granulosa cells (GCs) from F3/4 follicles after a 24-h exposure to growing doses of GBH ranging from 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT) to 36 mg of gly eq/L(N (number of experiment) = 4, n (number of replicat per experiment) = 4).

Among them, the alteration of hormone synthesis can be an easyparameter to assess with in vitro models.It has been shown that growing doses of a GBH applied on mouseMA-10 Leydig tumor cells for 2 h can reduce their pro-duction of progesterone in a dose dependent manner (Walsh et al., 2000 ).This could be due to a disruption of StAR protein expression, which mediates the rate-limit-ing step in steroidogenesis.StAR is a mitochondrial pro-tein that is rapidly synthesized in response tostimulation of the cell to produce steroid.
In our study,we observed that the GBH did not affect the mRNA expression of StAR and 2 enzymes named cytochromeP450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc or CYP11A1), and 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 b-HSD or HSD3B) that are very well known regulated the progesterone pro-duction ( Yamazaki et al., 2005 ). One hypothesis is that the reduction in progesterone production in response tothe GBH exposure is due to an inhibition of the activity of CYP11A1 and/or HSD3B.A study performed on bovine GCs showed that growing doses of GBH (10 and300mg/mL) drastically reduced progesterone and E2 production, while Gly alone had no signi ﬁcant effect (Perego et al., 2017 ).Here in chicken GCs, we used a Figure 5.(A) Progesterone (Pg) secretion in culture medium by primary granulosa cells (GC) from F1 follicles, after a 24-h exposure to growing doses of GBH ranging from 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT) to 36 mg of gly eq/L (N (number of experiment) = 4, n (number of replicates per experi-ment)).

Signi ﬁcant differences as compared to without GBH, LH or/and IGF-1 and VE condition (B, C and D) identi ﬁed by 1-way ANOVA are indicated by different lowercase letter at P<0.05.8 MATHIAS ET AL.GBH and not Gly, 1 hypothesis is that the inhibition in progesterone secretion observed be due to the co-formu-lants and not Gly.Several reports showed that co-for-mulants could be more toxics than Gly ( Mesnage et al., 2022;Makame et al., 2023 ;Defarge et al., 2016 ).We analyzed only progesterone secretion and not oestradiol.Indeed, in chicken, GCs are the source of progesterone,and estrogens are derived from theca cells by aromatase(Huang et al., 1979 ,Marrone and Hertelendy, 1983 ).Whereas, in the mammalian ovary, estrogens are pro-duced in GCs, and there was no or less expression ofCYP19A1 in theca cells ( Magof ﬁn, 2005 ).
We showed that the GBH exposure induced an increase in TOS, decrease in TAS and consequently anincrease in OSI from 3.6 mg of Gly eq/L in both F1 andF3/4 GC. Since the effects of GBH on steroid productionare observed with a lower concentration (0.36 mg of Gly eq/L), increased TOS, decreased TAS and thusincreased OSI due to exposure of granulosa cells to GBHare certainly not responsible for this inhibition of ste- roidogenesis.Many studies reported that Gly or/and GBHs are able to increase oxidative stress ( Wang et al., 2022;Cattani et al., 2023 ;Qi et al., 2023 ).Thus, we investigated if the antioxidant VE was able to alleviatethe negative effects on the steroid production.In mammals, some reports demonstrated a bene ﬁcial effect of VE after Gly or GBH exposure both in vivo(Chandran et al., 2023 ;Bhardwa et al., 2022 ; and in vitro ( €Unl€u Endirlik et al., 2022 ).
In the present study we demonstrated that VE is able to alleviate the nega-tive effects of GBH on the progesterone production andoxidative stress in chicken F1 and F3/4 GCs. However, Figure 6.(A) Progesterone (Pg) secretion in culture medium by primary granulosa cells (GCs) from F3/4 follicles, after a 24-h exposure to growing doses of GBH ranging from 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT) to 36 mg of gly eq/L (N (number of experiment) = 4, n (number of replicates perexperiment)).(B) Pg secretion in culture medium by primary GCs from F3/4 follicles, after a 24-h exposure to growing doses of GBH ranging from0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT), 0.36 and 1.8 mg of gly eq/L with or without addition of vitamin E (VE, 1 mg/L) (N = 4, n = 4).(C) Pg secretion by primary GCs from F3/4 follicles, after a 24-h exposure to growing doses of GBH ranging from 0 mg of gly eq/L (control, CT), 0.36 and 1.8 mg of gly eq/L in response to IGF-1 (10 /C08M) and LH (10/C08M), (N = 4, n = 4).

For example, melatonin alleviated Gly-inducedtestosterone synthesis inhibition via targeting mitochon-drial function in roosters ( Ren, 2024 ). It also alleviated the deterioration of oocytes and hormonal disorders from mice subjected to Gly ( Zhang, 2021 ).CONCLUSION In this study, we demonstrated that a GBH can alter the physiological functions of chicken GCs.Progesterone production and oxidative stress were strongly affected by the GBH exposure.All these effects were at least par-tially reversed by the addition of VE in the culturemedium.It remains to determine the molecular mecha-nisms and signaling pathways involved in the GBHs andVE effects.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank all the technicians from “P^ole Exp /C19erimental Avicole de Tours ”unit (INRAE, Nouzilly, France) for the care of animals.The authors thank toR/C19egion Centre Val de Loire for its support (Grant num- ber32000868 ).
