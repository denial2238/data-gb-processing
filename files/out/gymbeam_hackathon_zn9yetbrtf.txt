Background: DATATOP was a study of early Parkinson’s disease (PD) conducted in the 1980 s, before mandatory folic acid fortiﬁcation in the United States. Our analysis of its baseline serum samples revealed a geometric mean vitamin B12 of369 pg/mL and homocysteine (tHcy) of 9.5 /H9262mol/l.We also found that low B12 predicted greater worsening of ambulatory capacity (AC) and elevated tHcy (>15 /H9262mol/L) predicted greater declines in cognitive function.Objective: We sought to measure B12 and tHcy in contemporary trial participants with early PD who had not started dopaminergic treatment and to determine whether these analytes were associated with clinical progression.Methods: We measured B12 and tHcy from baseline and end-of-study blood samples from three recent clinical trials.Results: Baseline geometric mean B12 levels for these studies ranged from 484–618 pg/ml and for tHcy ranged from 7.4–10 /H9262mol/L.
Use of B12-containing supplements ranged from 41–61%, and those taking supplements had higher B12 and lower tHcy. Those who began levodopa, but were not taking B12-supplements, had greater end-of-study tHcy.There was noassociation of baseline tHcy > 15 /H9262mol/L with annualized change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment and no association of baseline B12 tertiles with change in AC.Conclusions: In these longitudinal trials, B12 levels were higher than for DATATOP, due in large part to increased B12- supplement intake, while tHcy levels were similar.Initiation of levodopa was associated with increases of tHcy in those nottaking a B12-containing supplement.These smaller studies did not replicate prior ﬁndings of low B12 and elevated tHcywith features of progression, possibly due to higher baseline B12.

Moreover, B12deﬁciency alone can cause multiple clinical featureswhich overlap with expected manifestations of PDprogression including cognitive, behavioral, neuro-muscular and autonomic changes [3]. Also, low B12has been associated with a number of features thatare recognized in more advanced PD, including neu-ropathy, where it is cited as the most common cause[4], and cognitive impairment [5].Interestingly, anepidemiology study found that longstanding elevatedintake of B12 predicted a lower risk for developingPD [6].Finally, experimental work has demonstratedthat B12 reduces α-synuclein ﬁbrillogenesis [7] and allosterically inhibits leucine-rich repeat kinase 2(LRRK2) [8], an enzyme for which certain muta-tions are associated with increased kinase activity anddominantly inherited PD.Vitamin B12 and folate are required as co-factor and co-substrate, respectively, for methionine syn-thase, the enzyme responsible for conversion ofhomocysteine to methionine.
When either B12 orfolate is deﬁcient, total homocysteine (tHcy) lev-els increase. Interestingly, tHcy is an establishedmodiﬁer for a number of conditions [9] includingdementia [10].Regarding its particular relevance inPD, levels of tHcy increase soon after starting orincreasing levodopa treatment [11] and elevated lev-els are associated with cognitive impairment anddepression [12].Moreover, both elevated tHcy andB12 deﬁciency have been associated with increases inthe inﬂammatory and immune responses which couldaccelerate PD [13, 14].Our recent investigation [15] of baseline serum samples in the DATATOP study [16], a clinicaltrial of early PD, showed 1) that the geometricmean B12 level at baseline was 369 pg/ml, 2) thatmean tHcy was 9.5 /H9262mol/L, and 3) that those in the low B12 tertile developed more gait impairmentas measured by greater increases in the ambulatorycapacity score [17].
Of equal interest, we found thatthose with elevated tHcy, deﬁned as > 15 /H9262mol/L, had greater declines in the Mini-Mental State Exam score(MMSE). Low B12 can usually be treated by oral B12 sup- plementation and elevated tHcy levels can be reducedby B12, B6 and/or folic acid supplementation [9].Since 1) the DATATOP study enrolled participantsfrom 1987–1988, prior to mandatory folic acid forti- ﬁcation in the United States (US) in 1998 and 2) USdietary surveys have shown increasing rates of vita-min supplement use over the past 4 decades [18], it isquite possible that B12 and tHcy levels differ in con-temporary PD patients.We conducted this study tomeasure B12 and tHcy from participants from threerecent clinical trials of early PD in order to understandthe relationships of these analytes with supplementuse and to test for their possible associations with gaitand cognition impairment as observed in DATATOP.
METHODS SURE-PD (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT000833690) recruited from 2009–2011 and enrolled 75 partic-ipants with early PD not requiring symptomatictreatment, although allowing treatment with type Bmonoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-Bi), and whoseserum uric acid was below 6 mg/dl [19]. Participantswere randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo,inosine titrated to mildly elevate serum urate, andinosine titrated to moderately elevate urate.Partic-ipants were followed for up to 2 years using theUniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as wellas the time until the need for initiating dopaminergictherapy.STEADY-PDIII (NCT02168842) recruited from 2014–2015.It enrolled 336 participants with earlyPD not taking symptomatic treatments, althoughallowing treatment with amantadine [20].
Partic-ipants were randomized to isradipine 5 mg twicedaily or placebo and followed up to 3 years usingthe UPDRS, Movement Disorder Society-UPDRS(MDS-UPDRS), MoCA, and time to initiate symp-tomatic treatment. SURE-PD3 (NCT02642393) recruited from 2016–2017 and enrolled 298 participants with earlyPD, not requiring symptomatic treatments, althoughallowing treatment with a MAO-Bi.Participants wererandomized to inosine or placebo [21].Based on aprespeciﬁed futility analysis, the study closed earlywith 92% of the randomized participants completingthe amended study which was originally designedto be a 2-year study.Participants were followedusing the MDS-UPDRS, MoCA, and time to initiatesymptomatic treatment.In addition, 123I-Ioﬂupane SPECT scans (DaTscans) were obtained at baselineand study termination.C.W.Christine et al./ B12 and tHcy in 3 Trials 1245 Plasma measurements Baseline and end of study plasma samples were shipped from a central repository on dry ice.
AtUC Davis, the samples were thawed and sep-arated for blinded analysis. B12 was measuredby Abbott Alinity Chemiluminescent Microparti-cle Immunoassay [22].Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)was measured using Liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry [23].tHcy was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography [24].Supplement, dopaminergic, and metformin treatment reporting As performed for the NET-PD LS1 study [25], we used the prospectively collected concomitant medica-tion and supplement logs from the studies to identifythe type, dose, and duration of oral multivitamin,B-complex and/or other B12 supplement for eachparticipant at baseline as well as for starting sup-plements during the study.Moreover, since eachstudy allowed participants to continue in the studyafter starting dopaminergic (dopamine agonist or car-bidopa/levodopa) treatment, we identiﬁed the startdate for those participants who began dopaminergictreatments.
In order to allow for the effect of levodopatreatment on tHcy levels to reach a steady state, forthis analysis, we included participants who began lev-odopa or dopamine agonist therapy >3 months priorto the end of the study, similar to a previous study [11].Since use of metformin is associated with lower B12levels [3], we also identiﬁed use of this medication atbaseline. Clinical rating scales The UPDRS was used as the main rating scale in SURE-PD and STEADY-PDIII.The MDS-UPDRS,an updated PD rating scale, was used as the main clin-ical outcome measure in SURE-PD3 and was alsoused in STEADY-PDIII.Ambulatory capacity, a gaitand stability rating scale, is deﬁned as the sum ofselected gait related items from the UPDRS [17].Since the MDS-UPDRS is based on the UPDRS, anMDS-UPDRS ambulatory capacity score has beendeveloped [26].In STEADY-PDIII, we calculatedambulatory capacity using both scales.
Since SURE-PD3 used the MDS-UPDRS exclusively, only theMDS-UPDRS ambulatory capacity is reported.Genotyping Genotyping data was available for SURE-PD3 and STEADY-PDIII. We extracted data for the commongenetic causes of PD including glucocerebrosi-dase (GBA) SNP variants (rs2230288, rs368060,rs76563715) and the LRRK2 variants (rs34637584and rs33995463) using the 2021 release of AMP-PD whole genome sequencing (WGS) data usingPLINK 2.0 [27].Because the methylenetetrahydrofo-late reductase (MTHFR) SNP variant rs1801133 TTgenotype is common and is associated with elevatedtHcy levels, we also tested for this variant.Extractedgenotypic data were converted to variant call for-mat (VCF) using PLINK 2.0 and then exported foranalyses using the vcfR and tidyverse R packages.
Statistical analyses Statistical comparisons of baseline characteristics by baseline B12 tertiles were performed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s studentizedrange test for continuous measures and Chi-squaretests with Bonferroni adjustment for categorical mea-sures. Mean baseline and ﬁnal B12 and tHcy levelsby 1) dopaminergic treatment initiation groups (noinitiation, initiated dopamine agonist not includinglevodopa, initiated levodopa and MVI or B com-plex supplement, initiated levodopa but no MVI orB supplement) and 2) utilization of B12 supple-ments groups (no use during the study, MVI orB-complex with amount of B12 < 100 /H9262g at baseline, or B12 > 100 /H9262g at baseline, started supplement after baseline) were compared using one-way analysis ofvariance with Tukey’s studentized range test.
Annu-alized changes in UPDRS scores, MDS-UPDRSscores, MoCA scores, and DaTscan striatal speciﬁcbinding ratio were based on the change from baselineto the ﬁnal visit, or in the case of UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS outcomes, the last visit prior to initiationof dopaminergic therapy. These rates were calcu-lated as the change in score from baseline dividedby the number of days between the two assess-ments multiplied by 365.Analysis of covariance wasused to determine associations between these annu-alized changes and 1) baseline B12 tertiles and 2)baseline tHcy > 15 /H9262mol/L vs.<15 /H9262mol/L, adjusted for baseline value of the outcome, age, sex, andtreatment group.Annualized change in ambulatorycapacity and MoCA scores were considered the pri-mary outcomes and the remaining were consideredexploratory, thus there was no correction for multiple 1246 C.W.Christine et al./ B12 and tHcy in 3 Trials testing.Comparisons of age, sex, and genetic out- comes by baseline tHcy > 15 vs.
≤15/H9262mol/L were performed using a t-test and chi-square tests. Anal- yses were performed using SAS version 9.4 andp-values < 0.05 were considered statistically signif- icant.Participants provided written informed consent for each of these studies according to the regulationsof their local institutional review board (IRB).TheUCSF IRB deemed this study exempt.RESULTS Baseline samples were available for 54/75 SURE- PD participants, 248/336 of STEADY-PDIII, and262/298 SURE-PD3 participants.Baseline and end ofstudy distributions for vitamin B12 and tHcy are dis-played in Fig.1.At baseline, the geometric mean B12levels for SURE-PD, STEADY-PDIII, and SURE-PD3 were 484, 524, and 618 pg/ml, respectively.Thegeometric means for baseline tHcy were 7.4, 10.0,and 9.7 /H9262mol/L, while the geometric means for MMA were 0.16, 0.18, and 0.18 /H9262mol/L respectively.
Over the course of each study, the geometric mean B12 lev-els declined 37 pg/ml/year in SURE-PD, 3 pg/ml/yearin STEADY-PDIII, and 18 pg/ml/year in SURE-PD3.In contrast, the tHcy levels increased 0.2 /H9262mol/L/year in STEADY-PDIII and 0.4 /H9262mol/L/year in SURE- PD3, but declined by 0.2 /H9262mol/L/year in SURE-PD. MMA levels were stable over the course of these stud-ies and because only a small number (6 participantsin STEADY-PDIII and 7 in SURE-PD3) were ele-vated (>0.4 /H9262mol/L) at baseline, MMA levels were not included in the subsequent analysis.Prevalence of low B12 or elevated tHcy status at baseline In SURE-PD, STEADY-PDIII, SURE-PD3, 7.4%, 5.2%, and 3.1% of participants, respectively, hadbaseline borderline low B12 (<250 pg/ml) levelswhile 3.7%, 3.6%, and 1.1% had B12 deﬁciency(<212 pg/ml).For baseline tHcy, 5% of participantsin both STEADPY-PDIII and SURE-PD3 had ele-vated levels while none in SURE-PD had elevatedtHcy.
Associations of B12 status with baseline features Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics accord- ing to B12 tertiles for each study. The expectedinverse associations of B12 tertiles with tHcy were signiﬁcant in STEADY-PDIII and SURE-PD3 andwith MMA in SURE-PD3.In STEADY-PDIII andSURE-PD3, there were also the expected associa-tions of reported use of supplements containing B12with B12 tertiles.In SURE-PD3, the baseline MDS-UPDRS part 3 score was actually lower in the lowB12 tertile compared to the middle tertile.Otherwise,the baseline characteristics were similar across B12tertiles.No associations for the hematological mea-surements of mean corpuscular volume or hematocritwith B12 tertiles were observed (not shown).Anal-ysis for common PD mutations in STEADY-PDIIIshowed 1.6% participants with LRRK2 mutationsand 3.2% with GBA mutations and in SURE-PD3,1.1% with LRRK2 mutations and 4.5% with GBAmutations (not shown).
Mutations were observed ineach tertile of these 2 studies and appeared to berandomly distributed. Vitamin supplement use and associations with baseline and end of study B12 and tHcy levels At baseline, the reported use of any vitamin sup- plement containing B12 was 61% in SURE-PD, 41%in STEADY-PDIII, and 52% in SURE-PD3.Acrossall three studies, use of a multivitamin or B complexvitamin (MVI/B-complex) was much more commonthan supplements containing only B12 (Table 1).Analysis according to use vs.non-use of B12 con-taining supplements (Fig.1, Table 2), showed thatmean B12 for taking MVI/B-complex supplementsat baseline ranged from 585–781 pg/ml, comparedto 456–563 pg/ml for those not taking supplements.Although B12 levels declined at the end of each study,they remained statistically higher in STEADY-PDIIIfor those taking MVI/B-complex supplements.
Notsurprisingly, participants who took supplements con-taining > 100 /H9262g of B12 had even higher B12 levels (>200 pg/ml) at baseline compared to those taking nosupplements. Moreover, across all three studies, tHcywas lower at baseline and end of study for those tak-ing MVI/B-complex at baseline compared to thosenot taking supplements.In SURE-PD3, those takingB12 > 100 /H9262g at baseline had lower tHcy than those taking B12 ≤100/H9262g and those not taking supple- ments, and in STEADY-PDIII, the end of study tHcywas lower in those taking MVI/B-complex supple-ments than those not taking supplements.Finally, forthose participants who began a B12 containing sup-plement during the course of the trials, there wereincreases in mean B12 of ≥200 pg/ml and reduc- C.W.Christine et al./ B12 and tHcy in 3 Trials 1247 Fig.1.Solid bars represent individuals who did not report any use of B12 supplements (Overall N).
Hashed bars represent those reporting use of B12 supplements (B12 subset) during study. These distributions show that B12 containing supplement use is associated with increasedB12 levels (rightward shift, A) and with reduced homocysteine levels (leftward shift, B).1248 C.W.Christine et al.

tions in tHcy of ≥0.6/H9262mol/L at the end of the study. End of study B12 and tHcy levels according start of dopaminergic treatment The design of these studies allowed partici- pants to begin dopaminergic treatments during thecourse of the study if clinically indicated.ForSTEADY-PDIII and SURE-PD3, those who beganlevodopa ≥3 months prior to study termination had greater increases of tHcy compared to those whodid not begin symptomatic treatment (not shown).This observation motivated us to analyze B12 andtHcy levels in those who initiated levodopa accord-ing to baseline use or non-use of an MVI/B-complexsupplement.In STEADY-PDIII and SURE-PD3, forthose who began levodopa during the study, thosenot taking an MVI/B-complex at baseline had lowerB12 levels at baseline and both lower B12 and highertHcy levels at the end of these studies compared tothose taking a MVI/B-complex (Table 3).
Acrossthe three studies, in contrast to those who startedlevodopa, for those starting a dopamine agonist, endof study mean tHcy levels were similar to those whodid not start dopaminergic treatment.Associations of baseline B12 status with clinical outcomes Table 4 shows the annualized change in outcome scores in each study according to baseline B12 ter-tiles. The UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS annualizedchanges are based on the last visit prior to start-ing dopaminergic treatment.For SURE-PD, althoughthe annualized changes for total UPDRS, motorUPDRS, and ambulatory capacity in the ﬁrst tertilewere greater, these were not signiﬁcantly differentfrom the second and third tertiles.
For STEADY-PDIII and SURE-PD3, the annualized changes inoutcomes according to baseline B12 tertiles weresimilar, although the change in total UPDRS scorewas lower in the ﬁrst tertile compared to the com-bined second and third tertiles in STEADY-PDIII.For SURE-PD3, where baseline and end of studyDaTscans were obtained, although there was a trendtowards greater annualized decline in striatal uptakein the low B12 tertile, this difference was not signif-icant. Because baseline geometric mean B12 levels were substantially higher in these studies compared to theDATATOP study, we also examined mean annualizedchanges in UPDRS or MDS-UPDRS and ambulatorycapacity prior to dopaminergic treatment according 1250 C.W.Christine et al.

to B12 tertile at baseline, using the low tertile cutoff from DATATOP of <317 pg/ml. Although the changein ambulatory capacity score was numerically higherfor SURE-PD and STEADY-PDIII, the differenceswere not signiﬁcant (not shown).Association of tHcy with MoCA Unexpectedly, when mean annualized changes in MoCA were analyzed according to baselinetHcy (Table 5), non-signiﬁcant increases (consistentwith improving cognitive function) were observedin participants with tHcy > 15 /H9262mol/L in STEADY- PDIII and SURE-PD3 compared to those withtHcy≤15/H9262mol/L.(There were no participants with elevated tHcy in SURE-PD.) Of those participantswith tHcy > 15 /H9262mol/L, 31% in STEADY-PD III and 27% in SURE-PD3, had B12 levels <250 pg/ml atbaseline.
We then tested whether elevated tHcy wasassociated with age, sex or MTHFR CC77T TT geno- type, which causes elevated tHcy, but no associationswere observed (Table 6).DISCUSSION This study measured blood B12, tHcy and MMA levels from three similarly designed contemporaryclinical trials of early PD and showed that mean B12levels were higher and B12 deﬁciency was less com-mon compared to the DATATOP study conducteddecades earlier. Unlike DATATOP, elevated tHcy atbaseline was not associated with more rapid worsen-ing of cognitive function as measured by the MoCA.Moreover, the association of greater worsening of gait as measured by the ambulatory capacity scoreaccording to B12 tertiles observed in DATATOP wasnot replicated in this study.We suspect that thiswas because substantially higher mean B12 levels inthese contemporary participants shifted the B12 ter-tile thresholds higher and reduced the power to detecta difference.
It is also likely that differences in studydesign, whereby investigators initiated dopaminergictherapy after modest worsening of UPDRS scores,reduced the power to detect an association. Theseinterpretations are supported by the trends seen in the C.W.Christine et al.

The numerical trend forsmaller declines in DaTscan striatal speciﬁc bindingin SURE-PD3 in higher B12 tertiles, provides intrigu-ing support for the hypothesis that higher B12 levelsmay slow nigro-striatal neurodegeneration, possiblyrelated to inhibiting α-synuclein ﬁbrillogenesis [7] and LRRK2 activity [8]. In these three studies, use of vitamin supplements containing B12, ranged from 41–61%, similar tonational surveys of MVI use [18] and to a recentstudy of early PD in North America [25].The geo-metric mean B12 levels ranged from 484–618 pg/mland were substantially higher than that of 369 pg/mlin DATATOP.Since B12 levels were higher in thosetaking supplements, the higher mean levels are likelydue in large part to MVI supplement use.With aging, modest declines of B12 levels are expected.
One study of healthy aging found a meanannualized decline of 5 pg/ml [28], The observedannual declines of 19 pg/ml/year in SURE-PD3 and37 pg/ml/year in SURE-PD were substantially higherthan expected in healthy aging, as has previouslybeen reported in PD [29], and may relate to changesin dietary/supplement intake during the course ofthese studies, changes in gastrointestinal absorptionover time, and/or to speciﬁc effect of levodopa ther-apy on B12 levels, as has been reported [11] andfor which trends were observed in STEADY-PDIIIand SURE-PD3 (Table 3, initiated levodopa but noMVI/B supplement). While B12 levels in these studies were higher than in DATATOP, the geometric mean for baseline tHcy,which ranged from 7.4–10 /H9262mol/L, was similar to 9.5/H9262mol/L in DATATOP.Moreover, the fraction of participants with elevated tHcy was only modestlylower in STEADY-PDIII and SURE-PD3 comparedto DATATOP (5% vs.7%).
Large surveys of nutri-tional status in the US conducted after mandatedfolic acid fortiﬁcation have shown that the geometric mean tHcy gradually increases about 0.5 /H9262mol/L per decade from age 40 and by age 60 is 9.3 for men and7.9/H9262mol/L for women [30]. After age 60, tHcy increases more rapidly [30].Aside from age, other factors associated with ele-vated tHcy levels include certain medical conditions(such as atherosclerosis, renal insufﬁciency, hypothy-roidism), vitamin deﬁciencies (B12, B6, and/orfolate), and genetic variants [11].Consistent withother studies [31], we did not ﬁnd a higher frequencyof the MTHFR CC77T TT genotype in those with tHcy >15 /H9262mol/L.
Thus, since B12 levels were higher across all three studies, the explanation of a similarrate of elevated tHcy at baseline in STEADY-PDIIIand SURE-PD3 is uncertain but might relate to insuf-ﬁciently elevated B12 levels as suggested by the lowerlevel of tHcy in the B12 >100 /H9262g supplement group in SURE-PD3 (Table 2) or other factors that affecttHcy levels. The design of these studies allowed testing for an association of starting dopaminergic treatmentwith changes in B12 and tHcy, and our analysisrevealed a dynamic relationship of MVI/B-complexuse and levodopa use with tHcy levels.We foundthat starting treatment with levodopa was associatedwith increases in tHcy, as previously reported [11],but in STEADY-PDIII and SURE-PD3, the expectedincrease in tHcy was largely prevented in those takingan MVI/B-complex throughout the study (Table 3).
In contrast to the ﬁnding of an association of ele- vated tHcy with annualized worsening in MMSEscores in DATATOP [3], we did not ﬁnd that baselineelevated tHcy predicted greater declines in the MoCAscore. In fact, in these 3 trials there was no decline inMoCA scores.Since cognitive function is expectedto worsen over time, the explanation for this result isuncertain but may reﬂect practice effects (the MoCAwas performed 4 times over 3 years in STEADY-PDIII compared to 4 times over 2-year period inSURE-PD3), reduced sensitivity of the MoCA com- C.W.Christine et al./ B12 and tHcy in 3 Trials 1253 pared to the MMSE to detect cognitive change when administered longitudinally [32], cognitive improve-ments after starting dopaminergic treatments [33],fairly short period of longitudinal follow-up, and/orprotective beneﬁts from greater mean B12 levels.Interestingly, elevated tHcy and cognitive impair- ment in PD have been associated with frontal corticalthinning [34].
Although the relationship of elevatedtHcy with development of cognitive impairment isrobust [10, 12, 35], the beneﬁt of B-vitamin sup-plementation in preventing development of cognitiveimpairment has not been established, although somebeneﬁt was reported in one cohort of patients withMCI and tHcy >11.3 /H9262mol/L [36] as well as a recent study of adults ≥65 years [37]. The strengths of this study include the analysis of longitudinally collected clinical data and blood sam-ples as well as mostly consistent ﬁndings across threesimilarly designed studies.The limitations includethe post-hoc design and the storage time betweenblood collection and analysis.However, becausethese studies used standard blood collection and stor-age procedures, and prior studies have shown stabilityfor B12 [38], MMA [38], and tHcy [39] over time, itis likely that these measurements are accurate.
Also,because these studies did not include standardizedreporting of all sources of supplement use, it is possi-ble that MVI or other B-vitamin supplement use areunderreported, particularly for unrealized additionalsources, such as fortiﬁed cereals, snacks, and drinkswhich are not normally assessed during clinical tri-als. Nevertheless, the clear correlations of B12 andtHcy levels with reported concomitant supplementuse indicates that for most participants, reporting ofsupplements was largely reliable.This study shows that participants taking an oral multivitamin supplement at baselinehad 100–200 pg/ml higher levels of B12 and0.5–1/H9262mol/L lower levels of tHcy.
This is consistent with the observation that in a population consuminga folic acid fortiﬁed diet, that the B12 level is thepre-eminent nutritional determinant of tHcy [40].Moreover, those who started levodopa during thesestudies, and were not taking a MVI/B-complex,had tHcy levels about 2 /H9262mol/L higher at study termination compared to those who were taking aMVI/B-complex. Extrapolation of these ﬁndings from clinical tri- als to the general PD population is problematic.Because borderline low levels of B12 were mea-sured in 3–7% of participants of these contemporaryclinical trials and simple oral B12 supplementationusing an MVI/B-complex supplement was associated with higher B12 levels, our results support the rou-tine measurement of B12 at the time of diagnosisand oral supplementation if found low.
Our ﬁndingsthat use of a MVI was associated with lower baselinetHcy and prevented elevations of tHcy after startinglevodopa provide support for considering empiricalMVI supplementation in early PD [41], although evi-dence for a clinical beneﬁt is lacking. Bearing inmind the limitations of brief cognitive instrumentsobserved in this study and others [32, 33, 42], a futuretrial using should be conducted to determine whethertreatment with B-vitamins, dosed to prevent eleva-tions of tHcy in early PD, reduces the development ofcognitive impairment, depression, or cardiovasculardisease.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr.Michael Schwarzschild and Dr.Tanya Simuni for their assistance in obtaining accessto the clinical trial results.We thank all the par-ticipants in these studies for their time and efforts.We acknowledge the contribution of the NINDSBioSEND for the storage and shipping of the SURE-PD blood samples.
