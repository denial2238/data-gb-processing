The plasma concentration of homocysteine is dependentontheactivitiesofseveralBvitamin–dependentenzymes,such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), and cystathionine β-synthase ( CBS). Objectives: Weinvestigatedwhethergeneticvariantsinsomeofthe genes involved in 1 carbon metabolism modify the association of B vitamin–related measures with bone mineral density (BMD) andstrength.
Methods: We measured several B vitamins and biomarkers in participants of the Framingham Offspring Study, and per-formed analyses of methylmalonic acid (MMA) continuously and <210 nmol/L; pyridoxal-5’-phosphate; vitamin B-12 continuously and≥258pmol/L;andfolate.Theoutcomesofinterestincludedareal andvolumetricBMD,measuredbyDXAandquantitativecomputed tomography(QCT),respectively.Weevaluatedassociationsbetween the bone measures and interactions of single nucleotide polymor-phism with a B vitamin or biomarker in Framingham participants (n=4310forDXAand n=3127forQCT).ForanalysisofDXA,we validatedtheassociationresultsintheB-PROOFcohort( n=1072). Bonferroni-correctedlocus-widesignificantthresholdsweredefined to account for multiple testing.Results:The interactions between rs2274976 and vitamin B-12 and rs34671784 and MMA <210 nmol/L were associated with lumbar spine BMD, and the interaction between rs6586281 and vitaminB-12≥258 pmol/L was associated with femoral neck BMD.
For QCT-derived traits, 62 interactions between genetic variants and B vitamins and biomarkers were identified.Conclusions: Some genetic variants in the 1-carbon methylation pathway modify the association of B vitamin and biomarkerconcentrations with bone density and strength. These interactions requirefurtherreplicationandfunctionalvalidationforamechanisticunderstanding of the role of the 1-carbon metabolism pathway on BMD and risks of fracture.Am J Clin Nutr 2021;114:578–587.Keywords: bone mineral density, genetic polymorphism, QCT, DXA, B vitamins Introduction Individuals with homocystinuria, a biochemical abnormality causing elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations, have an increased prevalence of osteoporosis ( 1–3), suggesting that milder elevations of Hcy may have adverse effects on bone.In fact, milder elevation in plasma Hcy is associated with a 2- to 4-foldincreasedriskofhipandotherosteoporoticfractures( 4,5).
WhilesomestudiessuggestthathighplasmaHcyconcentrationsmay be associated with increased osteoclast activity ( 6), higher rates of bone turnover ( 6), and low bone mineral density (BMD) (7),othershavefoundnoassociationbetweenHcyandBMD( 8– 10)ormarkersofbonemetabolism( 11).Arandomized,placebo- controlledclinicaltrialofvitaminB-12andfolate(alsoknownas B-9)overa2-yearperioddidnotfindimprovedmeasuresofbonedensity or reduced fractures in elderly individuals with elevated Hcy concentrations ( 12,13). Thus, whether Hcy directly affects bone mass and strength or is an “innocent bystander” remainsunclear (14).Potential candidates for the causative factor may lie along the pathway of the Hcy metabolism, which occurs through 2of the 1-carbon metabolic pathways: remethylation and trans- sulfuration.Remethylation involves 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the main circulating form of folate synthesized by the enzyme 578 Am J Clin Nutr 2021;114:578–587.Printed in USA.©The Author(s) 2021.

Given the dependency of the enzymes involved in the Hcy metabolism on folate and vitamins B-12 and B-6,deficienciesoftheseBvitaminscandisruptthesepathways, resulting in elevated Hcy ( 16–19), and Hcy concentrations may be determined by interactions among these genes and nutrients (20). Thus, the mechanism linking high Hcy concentrations to increased fracture risks may be found in the individual or jointeffects of these polymorphisms and B vitamins.TheFraminghamHeartStudy(FHS)wasconductedinpartusingdataand resourcesfromtheFHSoftheNationalHeartLungandBloodInstituteoftheNationalInstitutesofHealthandBostonUniversitySchoolofMedicine.Theanalyses reflect intellectual input and resource development from the FHSinvestigators participating in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism HealthAssociation Resource (SHARe) project.This work was partially supportedby the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s FHS (contract numbers N01-HC-25195andHHSN268201500001I)anditscontractwithAffymetrix, Inc.

Previous work showinganinteractionbetweentheC677T MTHFRgenotypeand plasma folate on bone ( 33,34) was confirmed by a subsequent study that found a similar interaction between the MTHFR genotype and dietary intake of not only folate, but also vitamins B-12,B-6,andB-2.TheuncertaintiesregardingtheroleoftheBvitaminsandgenesinthe1-carbonmetabolismpathwaysformed the basis for this investigation of the interaction between genetic variants in the genes involved in this pathway and B vitaminconcentrations on bone mineral density and strength. Methods Framingham study cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) began in 1948 with 5209 individuals between the ages of 28 to 62 years residing in Framingham, a small town 18 miles west of Boston, MA(35).In 1971, the Framingham Offspring Study was initiated by enrolling 5124 adult children of the original Framingham Study participants.Members of the Offspring Study were ages5 to 70 years at enrollment ( 36).
Grandchildren of the original Framingham Study participants were recruited in 2002–2005, and comprise the Third Generation Study ( 37). Participants of European ancestry in the current analysis were members of 2 of the Framingham Heart Study cohorts; the Offspring cohort and the Third Generation cohort.Participants in the study hadprovided written informed consent.The Institutional Review Boards at Boston University Medical Campus and Hebrew SeniorLife approved the study.B-PROOF study The B Vitamins for the Prevention of Osteoporotic Fractures (B-PROOF) study was a randomized, controlled trial which wasconducted in the Netherlands ( 38).This multicenter trial was designed to investigate the effect of a 2-year intervention of oral supplementation with vitamin B-12 and folic acid on theosteoporotic fracture incidence.From August 2008 to March 2011,thestudyrecruited2919participantsofEuropeanancestry with elevated Hcy concentrations.
The participants needed to beat least 65 years old, living independently or with assistance but not in a nursing home. The Wageningen University Medical Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, and the MedicalEthicscommitteesofErasmusMC(Rotterdam,theNetherlands) andVUmc(Amsterdam,theNetherlands)gaveapprovalforlocal feasibility.Bone measures Bone-related measures in the Framingham Offspring and Third Generation cohorts were measured using 2 techniques: quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and DXA.The 580 Liu et al.FIGURE 1 Therolesoffolate,vitaminB-12,vitaminB-6,andthe MTHFR,MTR,MTRR,andCBSgenesinthemetabolismofhomocysteine.Abbreviations: CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; MTHFR, methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR, methionine synthase; MTRR, methionine synthase reductase.vertebral volumetric bone density, cross-sectional area (CSA), and compressive strength were measured using QCT scans.
Compressive strength was calculated as 0.0068 ×Eave×cross- sectionalarea.E aveistheaverageelasticmodulusinmegapascals, derived from vBMD using a previously published, empirically derived relationship between QCT vBMD and the elastic mod- ulus of vertebral trabecular bone ( 39). As previously described, 3529 members of these 2 cohorts (ages 35 to 90 years; mean, 51years)participatedintheFHSOffspringandThirdGeneration Multi-Detector Computed Tomography Study ( 40,41) and had computed tomography scans of the chest and abdomen for assessments of coronary and aortic calcium between 2002 and 2005(42).Volumetricintegralbonemineraldensity(IBMD)and trabecularbonemineraldensity(TbBMD)ing/cm3,aswellasthe vertebral CSA in cm2, were determined from the CT scans using previously published algorithms ( 43,44), modified to assess multiple vertebral levels.
While the density and area measures were available for multiple spinal levels, for these analyses we usedthethirdlumbarvertebralbodyforallmeasures,sincevalidmeasures were available for the largest number of participants at the L3 level. We also considered bone-related measures obtained from DXA.In the FHS sample, we used DXA scans of the femoral neck and lumbar spine obtained in Offspring and Third Generation cohort participants using a Lunar DPX-L (Offspringcohort) and a GE Lunar Prodigy bone densitometer (Third Generation cohort) ( 45).For B-PROOF, DXA was performed in 2 of 3 centers, 1 with a Hologic QDR 4500 Delphi device andanother with a GE Lunar Prodigy device.The femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae L1 to L4 were scanned.Measurements of methylmalonic acid, folate, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6 Methylmalonic acid.InFHSparticipants,methylmalonicacid(MMA),abiomarker for vitamin B-12, was measured using the method of Lakso etal.(46), which was adapted for LC-MS/MS.
Deproteinated and acidified samples mixed with D3-MMA standard were injected into a PEEK ZIC-HILIC zwitterionic high-performance column(Merck SeQuant). which was attached to an ABI 3200 QTRAP tandem mass spectrometer.Inter- and intra-assay CVs were below 10%.In B-PROOF, MMA was measured by LC-MS/MS (intra- assay CV =8.1% at 0.18 μmol/L; inter-assay CV =1.6% at 0.24μmol/L) (47).While there are the difference in the preparation of the samples for determination of MMA between 2cohorts,bothmethodsarebasedonastableisotope(deuterated MMA) as an internal standard.Thus, the methods producevirtually the same results.Pyridoxal-5’-phosphate.In FHS participants, plasma pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B-6, was determined enzymatically using tyrosine decarboxylase based on the principles described by Shin-Buehring et al.( 48).
In this method, PLP activity in the plasma sample is determined on the basis of release of tritiated tyramine following the incubation of tyrosine decarboxylase apoenzyme with the supernatant fraction of trichloroacetic acid(TCA)-precipitated serum samples and tritium-labeled tyrosine. Genetics modify associations of B vitamins and BMD 581 Forqualitycontrol,weusedpooledplasma.TheCVforthisassay is 9%–10%.PLP was not available for B-PROOF.Vitamin B-12.InFHSparticipants,plasmavitaminB-12concentrationswere determined by the Immulite 1000 systems (Siemens MedicalSolutions Diagnostics).This method uses a competitive, liquid- phase, ligand-labeled, protein-binding, chemiluminescent assay to measure vitamin B-12.The CV for this assay is 7%.In B-PROOF, serum vitamin B-12 was determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys, 2010, Roche GmbH; CV, 5.1% at 125 pmol/L and 2.9% at 753 pmol/L).Folate.
Plasma folate concentrations in FHS participants were de- termined by the Immulite 1000 systems (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics). This method uses a competitive, liquid-phase, ligand-labeled, protein-binding, chemiluminescent assay to measure folate.The CV for this assay is 7%.In B-PROOF, serum folate was determined using electro- chemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys, 2010; CV, 5.9% at 5 .7n m o l / La n d2 .8 %a t2 3 .4n m o l / L ) .Genotyping.The selection of genes was based on the known methylation pathways outlined in the Figure 1.A total of 4 genes ( MTHFR, MTR,MTRR,CBS)wereselected,andallofthesinglenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene and in a region of30 kilo base pairs (kB) upstream and 20 kB downstream of each gene were considered in the analysis.
FHS-genotyped SNPs in these genes came from 3 sources: 1) FHS Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Health Association Resource Study (SHARe) datatypedinAffymetrixGeneChipHumanMapping500KArray and the 50K Human Gene Focused Panel; 2) the Candidate GeneAssociationResource(CARe)Project( 49)typediniSelect- ITMAT-Broad-CARe Chip, a custom 50 K SNP genotyping array;and 3)genotypestypedinanIlluminacustomplatefor384 SNPs. The quality controls for the SHARe and CARe genotype data were previously described ( 49,50).For the custom plate data, we performed quality controls and excluded the SNPswith call rates less than 90% and individuals with successfully typed rates less than 95% or with an extensive Mendelian inheritance error [ >15 Mendelian inheritance inconsistency found by software Merlin ( 51)].
We additionally excluded the SNPs with a Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Pvalue <10 –6.I n addition to the genotyped SNPs, we also imputed SNPs ineach of the genes (30 kB upstream and 20 kB downstream) using a backbone of genotyping performed with the Affymetrix 500K Dual GeneChip and a 50 K gene-centered supplementalarray set. Imputation was performed using the 1000 Genomes referencepanel(2010–08release).WeretainedallSNPsimputed at an observed over expected variability ratio >0.3 and with a minor allele frequency ≥5% for the imputed genotype.For B-PROOF, the genotyping was done with the Illumina-Omni express array, and standard quality control was performed(52).Subsequently imputations were done using the 1000 Genomes Project (PhaseIv3, March 2012) reference set.Among7 variants to be analyzed, all variants except 1 (rs2274976) were imputed.
Statistical analysis Weconductedastagedapproachtotesttheassociationofbone measurementsandtheinteractionbetweenSNPsandBvitamin–related measurements under additive, dominant, and recessive geneticmodels.The“dosage”information forimputedgenotype was used to account for uncertainty of imputation. In additionto the quantitative B vitamin–related measurements described in earlier sections, we also considered categorized vitamin concentrations with indicator variables B-12_c and MMA_c,defining adequate vitamin B-12 as >258 pmol/L (B-12_c =1 if B-12 >258 pmol/L and 0 otherwise) and adequate MMA as<210 nmol/L (MMA_c =1 if MMA <210 nmol/L and 0 otherwise).ForthecutpointofB-12,inadequateB-12isdefined as serum/plasma B-12 <258 pmol/L, a threshold indicating increased potential for vitamin B-12 deficiency, as observed inan older population ( 53).
For the cut point of MMA, we used 210nmol/LbasedontheupperendoftheMMAreferencerange (95thpercentile)inserumvitaminB-12–repleteparticipantswithnormal serum creatinine concentrations in the NHANES ( 54). In the first stage, we performed association analyses on Fram- ingham samples, including the Offspring and Third Generationcohorts, using linear mixed-effect models to account for the sample familial relatedness.The primary goal of our analysis wastoinvestigatetheassociationbetweenspecificbonemeasuresof interest and the interaction between genetic variants and B vitamin–relatedconcentrations.Weadjustedforage,sex,cohort, weight, “estrogenic status” (premenopausal, postmenopausal onestrogen, or postmenopausal not on estrogen)m and principal components obtained from genotypes to control for population stratification.We additionally adjusted for serum creatinine,which was measured using the modified Jaffe method in the analysis of MMA ( 55).
The outcomes of interest include the QCT-derived measures of IBMD, TbBMD, vertebral CSA, andcompressive strength, as well as the DXA-derived measures of femoral neck bone mineral density (FNBMD) and lumbar spine bone mineral density (LSBMD). We excluded the interactionresults with effect sizes ≥10.The interactions meeting the significant thresholds defined below for DXA-derived results were carried forward for replication in the B-PROOF studyand meta-analysis as a second stage.Of note, for each of the interactions between a B vitamin and genotype on a given bone trait, we only carried forward the most significant SNP andexcludedthosehavinghighlinkagedisequilibrium(LD; r 2>0.6) with the most significant SNP.In the second stage, we conducted a similar linear regression analysis with the same covariate adjustments as in the first stage to examine the potential interactions identified from the FHS data in the B-PROOF study.
Similar to the FHS analyses,we excluded the interaction results with effect sizes ≥10. We then performed a fixed-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis combining the summary statistics from the FHS and B-PROOFfor the measurement effects of interactions between SNPs and B vitamins.To determine the significance level for each locus, we calculated the effective number of independent SNPs ( Ind snp) based on an algorithm proposed by Li and Ji ( 56).Since we 582 Liu et al.

Results Sample characteristics Thestudyincludedupto5382individualsfrom2cohorts(FHS and B-PROOF) for the association analysis of DXA-derived traits,andupto3127participantsfromtheFHSforQCT-derivedtraits( Table 1;Supplemental Figure 1 ).Themeanages( ±SDs) of participants were 54.7 ±11.2 years, 72.9 ±5.7 years, and 52.3±11.7 years for the FHS DXA sample, B-PROOF sample, and FHS QCT sample, respectively. Females comprised 52%, 48%, and 48% of the FHS DXA sample, the B-PROOF sample,and the FHS QCT sample, respectively.Interactions of SNPs and B vitamins for DXA-derived measures For DXA BMD, we identified 10 interactions between B vitamins and SNPs that met the specified multiple testing–adjusted significance threshold in the FHS (1, 1, and 9 for the additive, dominant, and recessive models, respectively).For the recessive model, 3 interactions remained significant (i.e.,interaction Pvalue<predefined threshold and consistent effect directions) after the meta-analysis ( Table 2).
The association between LSBMD and B-12 was modified by a missense variant,rs2274976 (T/C), in MTHFR(interaction effect size of 0.001 for the T allele; Pvalue of 9.56 ×10 –7). The association between LSBMD and MMA_c was modified by rs34671784 (T/A) inMTR(interaction effect size of −0.341 for the A allele; Pvalue of 8.48 ×10 –8).The association between FNBMD and B-12_c was modified by an intronic variant rs6586281 (A/G) in CBS (interaction effect size of 0.116 for the A allele; Pvalue of 4.45×10–6).To better illustrate some of the observed interactions, we plotted results for the interactions between rs34671784 and MMA_c and rs6586281 and B-12 as examples in Figure 2 .

However, for individuals carrying the TT genotype in rs34671784, theLSBMD level was 0.3376 g/cm 2lower (calculated as 0.0034 −0.3410; i.e., beta_vit −beta_int in Table 2) in people with MMA <210 nmol/L compared to those with MMA ≥210 nmol/L. For individuals carrying GG or AG at rs6586281, those with B-12 ≥258 pmol/L had FNBMD levels that were 0.0067 g/cm2lowerthanindividualswithB-12 <258pmol/L.However, for individuals carrying the AA genotype at rs6586281, those with B-12 ≥258 pmol/L had FNBMD levels that were 0.1093 g/cm2higher(i.e., −0.0067 +0.116)thanthosewithB-12 <258 pmol/L.The interaction analyses involving rs34671784 and B-12_c were excluded in B-PROOF due to the effect estimate beingtoo extreme.Nevertheless, we listed these 2 associations in Supplemental Table 1 , along with QCT results, as a potential signal for validation in a future study.
Meta-analyses for theadditive and dominant models did not yield significant results, with inconsistent signs of interaction effects between the FHS and B-PROOF samples ( Supplemental Table 2 ). Interactions between SNPs and B vitamins for QCT-derived measures For QCT-derived vertebral bone phenotypes, we identified 4, 15,and43significantinteractionsbetweenSNPsandBvitaminsin the additive, dominant, and recessive models, respectively (Supplemental Table 1).For example, in the additive model, the interaction between B-12 (categorical) and a 5’ untranslatedregion (5’-UTR) annotated variant rs3738547 (T/C) in MTRwas positively associated with TbBMD (interaction effect size of 0.0323 for the T allele; Pvalue of 6.91 ×10 –8)a n dI B M D (effect size of 0.0335 for the T allele; Pvalue of 3.27 ×10–7).
The interaction between B-12 (categorical) and a missense variantrs12749581(A/G)in MTRwasnegativelyassociatedwith TbBMD (effect size of −0.0237 for the A allele; Pvalue of 1.57×10–8) and IBMD (effect size of −0.0183 for the A allele; Pvalue of 4.11 ×10–5). For reference, we present the LD information for the reportedvariantswithinthesamechromosomein Supplemental Tables 3–5 .Discussion We conducted genetic association analyses to investigate the interactions between variants in the genes involved in the 1-carbon methylation pathway and B vitamin concentrations on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and volumetric BMDand the vertebral CSA.For DXA-derived BMD, we identified significant LSBMD-associated interactions between the variant inMTHFRand B-12 and between the variant in MTRand MMA (categorical).We also identified that the interaction between the variant in CBSand B-12 (categorical) was significantly associated with FNBMD.
For QCT-derived vertebral BMD,62 interactions between genetic variants and B vitamins and biomarkers were associated with IBMD, compressive strength, 584 Liu et al.

TbBMD, and CSA, although there were no comparable mea- sures in our replication cohort to be able to validate these findings.Hcy is metabolized through 2 of the 1-carbon methylation metabolic pathways: remethylation and trans-sulfuration.In remethylation, Hcy is converted to methionine, which requires folate and vitamin B-12, and through the trans-sulfurationpathway, it is converted to cystathionine, which requires pyridoxal-5’-phosphate.For DXA results, in this study we observed significant interactions of genetic polymorphisms inthe remethylation pathway—specifically, MTRandMTHFR— withvitaminB-12bloodconcentrationsandMMAbloodconcen- trations (categorical).We also found evidence for contributionsof genetic polymorphisms in the trans-sulfuration pathway (i.e., CBS) in interactions with vitamin B-12 blood concentrations (categorical).
MTR is a vitamin B-12–dependent enzyme. One of the most studied polymorphisms in the MTR gene is A2756G (A >G transition).This polymorphism decreases enzyme activity as theB-12 cofactor in methylation.There is a significant association between MTRA2756G (rs1805087) and the gastric cancer risk, andMTHFR G1793A (rs2274976) statistically interacts with dietary folate intake, also contributing to the gastric cancer risk (58).Inborn errors of metabolism resulting in functional deficiency of methionine synthase due to mutations in the MTR gene are characterized by homocystinuria, hyperhomocysteine- mia, and hypomethioninemia ( 59).It is particularly notable that methionine synthase requires the methylated form of vitamin B-12 and catalyzes the remethylation of Hcy to methionine using5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor.Thus, our observed interaction between MTRvariants and vitamin B-12 concen- trations has biologic plausibility.
Interestingly, MTRA2756G (rs1805087) is in LD with 1 of the variants identified in ourstudy, rs34671784 (with D’ =0.912 and r 2=0.012), although we did not observe a significant signal for rs1805087 itself. Additionally, an interaction with MTHFRG1793A (rs2274976) was also identified in our study.The enzyme MTRR activates MTR after the vitamin B- 12 component of MTR has been oxidized, and is knownto regulate the synthesis of L-methionine, the precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor involved in DNA methylation.In a mouse model, mutations in the MTRRgene werefoundtobeassociatedwithitsreducedexpression,possibly leading to congenital abnormalities, even with normal dietary folate (60).Of note, the transgenerational effect of MTRR deficiency in these rodents may only be overcome by folate fortification for more than 1 generation.
In our study, the interactions were mostly observed for measuresofbonedensity(TbBMD)evaluatedusingQCT,aswell as aBMD evaluated by DXA, rather than for CSA. Therefore, we postulate that the interactions between B vitamin and genesinfluence measures of BMD rather than bone size, although in vitro studies are needed to validate our findings.The fact that we identified more interactions when considering the volumetricdensity measures than when using DXA suggests that this phenotype may be better for genetic studies, although we were unable to replicate these findings because of a lack of QCTmeasure availability in the B-PROOF sample.This possibility is Genetics modify associations of B vitamins and BMD 585 reinforced by our previous work, which identified a novel locus forvolumetricspineBMDthatwasnotpreviouslyobservedwhen using DXA-derived BMD ( 61).
Interestingly, our associations were observed using lumbar spine aBMD or volumetric BMD, while the earlier studies, which only included samples from the FHS Offspring cohort, were mostly focused on the association of Hcy with femoralBMD and hip fractures ( 4,33). This supports the generalized effect of the interactions found.It is of particular note that the B-PROOF randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial failedto demonstrate any effect of supplementing vitamin B-12 and folate on BMD or fracture.A potential reconciliation of our findings with the null findings of the B-PROOF clinicaltrial is that the efficacy of supplementation might depend on genetic variants influencing the effects of supplementation on bone.In the same vein, we did not find interactions of B-6 with the genetic polymorphisms, which might support its use as a supplement independent of an individual’s genetic constitution.There are several limitations worth noting.
We conducted this study using the sample of European ancestry in the FHS and B-PROOF. Generalizability of our results to other ethnicgroups requires further exploration.Another potential limitation isthatthevitaminB-12andfolatemeasurementswereperformed using different methods between studies, which might havelimited our power for replication even though we retained some significantresultswithreplication.Inaddition,theagedifference (∼18 years) between the FHS and B-PROOF samples might contribute to some of our null results in replication.De-spite having rich data on QCT-measured vBMD in the FHS, neither the B-PROOF sample nor other studies had B vi- tamin plasma concentrations and relevant genetic data toreplicate our QCT findings.Also, Hcy was not measured in these cohorts at the time the other measures were ob- tained.Studying the genotypes of Hcy-pathway genes and their interaction with B vitamins with respect to the Hcy metabolism remains important.
We found the interaction between geneticvariantsandBvitaminconcentrationsonbonestrength,although this still needs to be demonstrated using in vitro studies.
