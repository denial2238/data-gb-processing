STUDIES ON THE PNEUMONIC EXUDATE.V.~HE RELATION OF PNEUMONIC LUNG PROTEASE ACTIVITY HYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION, AND A CONSIDERATION OF Ttt"E ORIGIN OF TEE ENZYME.TO BY ROBERT N.NYE, M.D.(From the Research Laboratory of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.) (Received for publication, August 26, 1921.) That leucocytes contain an enzyme or enzymes capable of splitting native proteins to simpler nitrogenous compounds is an accepted fact at the present time.As early as 1877 Filehne 1 succeeded in obtaining from the sputum of a case of lung gangrene by extraction with glycerol an enzyme capable of dissolving fibrin and coagulated egg white in slightly alkaline media.A few years later Stolnikow ~ and Escherich" obtained similar results with extracts of sputa from cases of bronchitis, pneumonia, and phthisis.At that time the origin of the enzyme was disputed.
Mtiller 4 conducted a series of experiments relative to the action of empyema and abscess pus on fibrin and coagulated egg white, and found that the substances were readily dissolved. The sputa from cases of lobar pneumonia at the time of or just following crisis had a similar effect; whereas, before the crisis no enzyme action could be demonstrated.He also noted that pieces of pneumonic lung immersed in toluene water and placed in the incubator for several days became considerably lighter.He was of the opinion that the enzyme came from the destroyed white blood corpuscles.Simon, 5 following out Mfiller's views, studied chemically the autolysis of toluene water extracts of lungs from cases of lobar pneumonia.The extracts of five out of the six cases studied gave a primary acid reaction, and were subsequently neutralized or made slightly alkaline with calcium or sodium car- bonate.
After incubation for 5 to 8 days the average decrease in coagulable nitro- gen, or increase in non-coagulable nitrogen, was 30 per cent; and an average of 30 per cent of the increase in non-coagulable nitrogen was accounted for by an t Filehne, W., Sitzungsber. physik.-med.Soc.Erlangen, 1877, ix, 169, cited by Stolnikow3 Stoinikow, J., St.Petersb.reed.Woch., 1878, iii, 160.8 Escherich, T., Deutsch.Arch.klin.Med., 1885, xxxvii, 196.4 Miiller, F Verhandl.Cong.inn.Med., 1902, xx, 192.5 Simon, O., Deutsck.Arch.klin.Med., 1901, lxx, 604.153 154 P~-EUMONIC EXUDATE.V actual increase in albumoses.The lung of the sixth case was in the stage of red hepatization; the extract was alkaline in reaction and underwent no autolysis.Control experiments on normal lung extracts showed no autolysis.About the same time Achalme e working with pus from various localities demonstrated the presence of a proteolytic enzyme capable of digesting fibrin and casein.
He, also, concluded that this enzyme was derived from the leucocytes. More recently 0pie ~ has carefully studied the proteolytic enzymes of sterile inflammatory exudates produced by intrapleural injections of an aleuronat sus- pension in rabbits and dogs.He concluded that there were two distinct proteoly- tic enzymes present in the exudates--a leucoprotease derived from the polymor- phonuclear leucocytes and acting best in slightly alkaline media (0.2 per cent sodium bicarbonate), and a lymphoprotease derived from the mononuclear cells and acting best in slightly acid media (0.2 per cent acetic acid).The action of both enzymes was inhibited by the antiferment of normal beef serum.Jobling and Strouse 8 repeated some of Opie's work and came to essentially the same con- clusions except that they believed there was also an erepsin-like enzyme present, active in both acid (0.2 per acetic acid) and alkaline (0.2 per cent sodium bicar- bonate) media.
Demby 9 demonstrated in leucocytic suspensions enzymes capable of splitting peptone (optimum pH 7.6 to 8.0). In a series of investigations on pneumonic exudates undertaken in this labora- tory Lord t° with cellular suspensions from pneumonlc lungs ranging from pH 3.1 to 7.3 obtained visible erosion on L~ffler's blood serum only at the higher end of the scale (pH 6.7 to 7.3).Peptone solutions were appreciably split by these cellular suspensions, and most complete splitting occurred at pH 5.2 or 6.3.He formulated the hypothesis that during the course of the disease in the pneumonic lung there is a gradual decrease in pH or increase in acidity.Primarily and at that time when the reaction of the exudate is about that of the circulating blood (pH 7.3 to 7.5) there is a digestion of the more highly organized proteins (fibrin, serum albumin, etc.) following the liberation of enzyme through cellular disinte- gration.
With subsequent increase in acidity (beyond pH 6.7) the activity of this protease diminishes and conditions reach an optimum for the activity of the peptone-splitting enzyme. This peptonase or ereptase carries the splitting of the digestion products to amino-acids, absorbable as such; and resolution takes place.It seemed advisable to determine quantitatively the digestive action of the exudate on one of the higher proteins and the relation of hydrogen ion concentration to the activity of the enzyme.As a s Achalme, Compt.rend.Soc.biol., 1899, U, 568.Opie, E.L., J.Exp.Med., 1906, viii, 410.8 Jobling, J.W., and Strouse, S., Y.Exp.Meal., 1912, xvi, 269.g Dernby, K.G., J.Biol.Chert., 1918, xxxv, 179.1° Lord, F.T., Y.Exp.Med., 1919, xxx, 379.a~OBERT N.~ 155 substrate fibrin was chosen, since it is one of the higher proteins which must be bioken down in the pneumonic lung during the process of resolution.
Since a cellular suspension of the consolidated lung, rather than of the exudate alone, was used, it was necessary to rule out the action of enzymes contained in normal lung tissue. EXPERIMENTAL.1.Preparation of Substrate.--A mass of fresh horse fibrin about the size of a baseball was picked and washed practically free from adhering blood clot, and then passed through a meat chopper with a nut butter cutter attachment.The mash was centrifuged and washed repeatedly with water until the supernatant fluid was clear and colorless.The water was filtered off and the fibrin dried at 100°C.over night on a steam water bath.After grinding, the yield was 2.7 gin.2.Preparation of Enzymes.--Portions of gray-red hepatization and normal lung from a case of Type I lobar pneumonia had each been previously ground in a meat chopper with a nut butter cutter attachment and kept in the ice box several weeks following the addition of chloroform and toluene.
The consolidated lung mash was washed through two thicknesses of sterile gauze with 0.85 per cent sterile salt solution and the washings were centrifuged and washed four or five times with salt solution. The final centrifuging (No.7 stop for 7 minutes) yielded 5 cc.of "cells," which were made up to 15 cc.with sterile salt solution.The normal lung mash was ground with sterile sand in a sterile mortar; and, after separating the sand from the suspension by centrifuging at low speed, treated as above.The yield was only 0.6 cc.of "ceils;" these were made to 15 cc.with salt solution.3.Method.--To dry 60 cc.sterile flasks were added phosphate mixtures, fibrin, 10 cc.of sterile water (Nos.6 to 15 inclusive, 15 cc.), and 1.0 cc.of cellular suspen- sions (Nos.6 to 15 inclusive, 1.5 ec.) (Table I).
To those flasks intended to have pH values of 4.0 and 5.0 were added 4 drops of a 2 per cent aqueous solution of sodium alizarin sulfonate, and to the remainder 2 drops of a 0.01 per cent solution of phenol red. The flasks were adjusted approximately to the desired pH by the addition of normal and 0.1 normal hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide and comparison with a set of standard pH solutions prepared according to Clark and Lubs.n Water was added to make the total volume 20 cc.(Nos.6 to 15 inclusive, 30 cc.).After thorough agitation 10 cc.samples were removed from Flasks 6 to 15 inclusive.1 co.of toluene was added to each flask and all were tightly corked and placed in the incubator at 37.5°C.for 5 days.Cultures taken after 12 hours incubation and at the end of the experiment were sterile.During incubation there was no appreciable change in reaction.
The coagulable proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (3 per cent of total volume) according to Greenwald.

Nitrogen determinations on the filtrates were made by Folin's ~s macro Kjeldahl method, using 5 cc. samples and 5 cc.of his digestion mixture.Duplicate determinations were made on all filtrates.The non-coagulable nitrogen repre- senting the actual digestion of the fibrin by the cellular enzymes was obtained by subtracting the sum of the non-coagulable nitrogen of the fibrin and tung con- trols from that of the digestion mixture.The results are expressed as the average amount of non-coagulable nitrogen present in 20 cc.Amino nitrogen was deter- mined by Van Slyke's 14 nitrous acid method using 2 cc.samples of the filtrates following the precipitation of the coagulable nitrogen.Blank determinations made with distilled water and with distilled water saturated with toluene elimi- nated the presence of traces of the preservative as a source of error.Results are expressed as the amount of amlno-acid nitrogen present in 20 cc./ , • ~ l'~ 04 • 5 g '7 8 • 4 5 p6 ?5 prl TEx~-Fm.1.T~x~-Fm.2.

The cellular suspension controls of normal lung show an appreciable digestion of the fibrin at pH 4.0, and practically no increase in non-coagulable nitrogen in the less acid media (Text-fig. 1).DISCUSSION.This protease can be conceived as arising from one or more of four sources: (a) the pneumococci, (b) the cells present in the normal lung, (c) the blood serum, and (d) the cells of the pneumonic exudate.Avery and Cullen t~ have been able to obtMn from pneumococci intracellular enzymes capable of digesting fibrin.With fibrin freshly prepared from rabbit blood and the bile extract from the organisms contained in 200 cc.of a plain bouillon culture of Pneumococcus Type II, the total actual digestion at pH 7.4 amounted to an in- crease of 0.26 rag.of amino nitrogen.With 0.2 gm.of commercial fibrin and a similar amount of enzyme, their actual increase in amino nitrogen was only 0.11 rag.
Furthermore, since their enzyme con- tained non-coagulable nitrogen and in addition underwent autolysis on incubation, it is conceivable that in their digestion mixtures a portion of the increase in amino nitrogen might have been due not to an enzyme digesting native protein but to one autolyzing the enzym- atic non-coagulable nitrogen--a peptonase, the presence of which they dearly demonstrated in extracts of the pneumococcus. With 0.3 gm.of fibrin and 0.33 cc.of washed cellular suspension from the pneumonic lung the total increase in amino nitrogen at pH 7.4 fell somewhere between 1.60 rag.(pH 7.0) and 1.97 rag.(pH 8.0).Stained it Avery, O.T., and Cullen, G.E., J.Exp.Med., 1920, xxxii, 547.ROBERT U.~ 159 smears of the cellular suspension showed no intact organisms.In the washing of the cellular material in preparation one Would expect the enzyme liberated from the disintegrated pneumococci to have been lost.Undoubtedly the pneumococcus protease contained in 0.83 cc.
of washed cellular suspension is negligible when considering digestion amounting to 1.60 to 1.97 rag. of amino-acid nitrogen.OpiC has shown that sterile pleural exudates containing an excess of mononuclear cells exhibit maximum proteolytic activity in slightly acid media (0.2 per cent acetic acid).The phagocytic mononuclear or endothelial cells are derived from the endothelial cells lining the blood and lymph vesselsY A cellular suspension obtained from a normal lung, or to a less degree from the true lung substance of a pneumonic lung, would contain, so far as those cells which are known to contain proteolytic enzymes are concerned, chiefly endothelial cells.Consequently from Opie's work one would expect maximum digestion in a slightly acid medium.This was exactly what happened in the normal lung cellular suspension and fibrin digestion mixtures.Since nearly twice as much fibrin was digested at pH 4.0 by the 0.04 cc.of normal lung cellular suspension as by the 0.33 cc.
of pneumonic cellular suspension, it can be safely assumed that the latter did not contain as much true lung substance as the former. In spite of the presence of at least an equal amount of true lung substance, the normal lung suspension as compared with that of the pneumonic lung shovced but slight digestion in the slightly acid, neutral, and slightly alkaline digestion mixtures.Hence, the enzyme, or enzymes, derived from the true lung substance of a pneumonic lung play but a slight r61e in the proteolysis of fibrin by the pneumonic lung cellular sus- pension except in moderately acid media (pH 4.0).Proteases or trypsin-like ferments are known to be normally present in blood serum; but they are held in abeyance by the presence of antitrypsin.Delezenne and PozerskF s observed that the anti- tryptic power of the serum is lost following extraction with chloro- form.
It is conceivable that in lung cellular suspensions preserved with chloroform and toluene the serum proteases become potentially tTMallory., F.

This protease is able to convert horse fibrin to a non-coagulable split product. In a pH range of 4.0 to 8.0 the digestion is slight at the most acid end.With decrease in acidity there is a gradual rise in activity to pH 6.0, and then a sharp increase up to the maximum digestion at pH 8.0.Judging from the amino nitrogen determina- tions, the most complete splitting occurs at pH 7.0.The degree of autolysis occurring in the pneumonic lung cellular suspension controls suggests that the active enzyme is identical with that causing the digestion of the fibrin.3.Washed cellu]ar suspensions of normal lungs, previously pre- served with chloroform and toluene, contain a proteolytic enzyme which is active in a moderately acid medium (pH 4.0) and essentially inactive in less acid, neutral, and slightly alkaline media.The author is indebted to Dr.F.T.Lord for many helpful suggestions.
