This trial evaluated whether iron supplementation enhances exercise capacity of nonanemic patients withCKD who have iron-de ﬁciency. Methods: Prospective, multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial of nondialysis patients with CKD and iron-de ﬁciency but without anemia (Hemoglobin [Hb] >110 g/l).Patients were assigned 1:1 to intravenous (IV) iron therapy, or placebo.An 8-week exercise program commenced at week 4.The primaryoutcome was the mean between-group difference in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) at 4 weeks.Secondaryoutcomes included 6MWT at 12 weeks, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin (SF), Hb, renal func- tion, muscle strength, functional capacity, quality of life, and adverse events at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 12 weeks.Mean between-group differences were analyzed using analysis of covariance models.
Results: Among 75 randomized patients, mean (SD) age for iron therapy ( n¼37) versus placebo ( n¼38) was 54 (16) versus 61 (12) years; estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) (34 [12] vs. 35 [11] ml/min per 1.73 m 2], TSAT (23 [12] vs.21 [6])%; SF (57 [64] vs.62 [33]) mg/l; Hb (122.4 [9.2] vs.127 [13.2] g/l); 6MWT (384 [95] vs.469 [142] meters) at baseline, respectively.No signi ﬁcant mean between-group difference was observed in 6MWT distance at 4 weeks.There were signi ﬁcant increases in SF and TSAT at 4 and 12 weeks (P<0.02), and Hb at 12 weeks ( P¼0.009).There were no between-group differences in other secondary outcomes and no adverse events attributable to iron therapy.Conclusion: This trial did not demonstrate bene ﬁcial effects of IV iron therapy on exercise capacity at 4 weeks.A larger study is needed to con ﬁrm if IV iron is bene ﬁcial in nondialysis patients with CKD who are iron-de ﬁcient.

These abnormalitiesare restored following iron repletion.4,6,7This phenome- non has been studied in patients with heart failure treated with IV iron exhibiting improved exercise capacity and patient-reported outcomes8-10as early as 4 weeks and lasting up to 24 weeks after treatment compared to those receiving placebo.These ﬁndings persisted up to 12 months post therapy11and the effects were evident without any signi ﬁcant change in Hb, suggesting that the effects were mediated via improvements in cardiac and/or skeletal muscle function following iron repletion.
Studies have identi ﬁed skeletal muscle mitochon- drial dysfunction in CKD, which may contribute to skeletal muscle dysfunction.12-14It has been suggested that iron-de ﬁciency contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced energy production in cardiac and/or skeletal muscle of patients with CKD, and importantly may contribute to the reduced exercise capacity, physical function, and fatigue commonly re- ported in this population.15,16There is a dearth of studies exploring the effect of iron repletion on cardiacor skeletal muscle metabolism in nonanemic patients with CKD.
17A recent trial in nondialysis-dependent kidney patients who were iron-de ﬁcient but not anemic reported no signi ﬁcant improvements in exer- cise capacity or patient-reported outcomes at 4 or 12 weeks following iron repletion.18 Exercise training for patients with CKD has been shown to be bene ﬁcial for improving exercise capac- ity19; however, the limited training responses observed in some patients remain unexplained.20It is possible that combining exercise training with iron therapycould target disease-related derangements in the oxy- gen transport chain and result in enhanced physio- logical adaptations to exercise in patients with CKD. 20 In this trial, we examined whether a strategy of IV iron therapy in patients with stages 3 –4 CKD who were iron-de ﬁcient (SF <100mg/l and/or TSAT #20%) but notanemic (Hb 110 –150 g/l) leads to improvements in exercise capacity, physical function, and fatigue; and explored the effects of combined exercise training andiron therapy.
Objectives Primary Objective To assess the effect of IV iron therapy compared to pla- cebo on exercise capacity, measured by the distance walked during the 6MWT at 4 weeks post iron infusion. Secondary Objectives To assess the effect of IV iron therapy compared toplacebo on exercise capacity (6MWT) at 12 weeks, ironstatus (ferritin, TSAT) and Hb, kidney function (urea, creatinine, and eGFR), Volume of Oxygen consumption VO 2peak test (in a subset of participants), isokinetic dynamometry (muscle strength of knee extensors),functional capacity (sit-to-stand 60), quality of life (Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36 questionnaire, KDQOL-36), the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), the Chalder Fatigue questionnaire, and adverse events at 4 and 12 weeks.
Skeletal muscle phosphocreatine recovery half-time on magnetic reso- nance imaging spectroscopy ( n¼40 patients at baseline and week 4), muscle metabolism (at baseline and at 4 weeks), the impact of iron therapy on iron regulatorygenes ( HFE, TMPRSS6 ), and a qualitative exploration of participant experience were assessed as part of the study but are not reported here. METHODS This was an investigator-led multicenter double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of patients with stages 3 to 4 CKD and iron-de ﬁciency, but without anemia, aged 18 or over.The study design, ﬂow of participants through the trial and methods have pre- viously been reported.21The trial was funded by Kidney Research UK and supported by an unrestricted grant from Vifor (with donation of ferric carbox- ymaltose for the trial).Brent Ethics Committeeapproved the protocol (19/LO/0128) and the study was prospectively registered (EudraCT: 2018-000144-25 on 28/01/2019).
Adults with established nondialysis-dependent CKD stages 3 to 4 who had an SF of less than 100 mg/l and/or a TSAT of less than 20% but no anemia (de ﬁned in this study as a Hb 110 –150 g/l for both males and females) were eligible to participate. Full eligibility criteria are provided in the protocol paper.21 Randomization, Treatment, and Follow-Up Patients were randomized within 4 weeks after meeting screening requirements and were assigned in a 1:1 ratio using a secure web-based service supported by King ’s Clinical Trials Unit.Randomization used an approach based on randomly varying block sizes.Randomization was strati ﬁed by a single binary variable, de ﬁned by whether patients had a screening ferritin >50mg/l or#50mg/l, with planned capping so that a maximum of 35 patients had a screening ferritin >50mg/l.
Participants were randomized to receive either 1000 mg ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject, CSL Vifor, Switzerland) in 100 ml normal saline or 100 ml normal saline placebo only as a one-off infusion at the baseline visit. Patients we re blinded to the treatment that they received, and all outcome assessments were performed by blinded research assistants who wereSA Greenwood et al.: Iron Therapy in Iron-De ﬁcient Non-Anemic Patients CLINICAL RESEARCH Kidney International Reports (2023) 8,1496 –1505 1497 unaware of group allocation.All participants were offered 8 weeks of exercise training between week 4 and week 12 assessment visits.The exercise training program has been reported previously.21Brieﬂy, participants were assessed at 4 weeks and offered three 1-hour sessions of exercise training each week for 8 consecutive weeks, concen- trating on large muscle groups of the lower limbs.
The intervention was delivered by trained physiotherapy assistants, on an individual basis, in a hospital gym. Due to COVID-19 related restrictions on trial visits, and related patient concerns about traveling and attending hospital, some patients were offered the option ofcompleting these sessions of exercise training at home via an online kidney-speci ﬁc exercise platform, called Kidney Beam 22https://beamfeelgood.com/onDemand/ list/kidney-disease that was freely available on any technological device via the Internet.Each participant was provided with a heart rate monitor for use during the 8-week exercise training program, written guid- ance on how to access the platform, and exercise recording sheets.Study Schedule Full trial schedule has been reported previously.21 Brieﬂy, eligible participants were invited to attend a baseline visit, with follow-up at 4 weeks ( /C64 days) and 12 weeks ( /C614 days) after treatment.
Assessments included 6MWT distance, eGFR, biochemical pro ﬁle, full blood count, SF, TSAT, C-reactive protein, and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio. Knee extensor iso- kinetic and isometric muscle strength was measured bilaterally using a Biodex S4 Isokinetic System Pro dynamometer (Mirion Technologies), physical function was assessed by the sit-to-stand 60 test,23and peak aerobic capacity (VO 2peak) was measured in a subset of participants.Patient-reported outcome measures included the Chalder Fatigue questionnaire, the WSAS and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short-Form 1.3 questionnaire.Trial End Points The primary end point was the 6MWT distance at 4 weeks which was selected to provide clinical relevance.Studies that have evaluated the clinically meaningful change in the distance walked on the 6MWT in pa-tients with heart failure 24,25suggested a distance be- tween 32 m and 45 m.
Estimations from the FAIR-HF study9and a study in patients with CKD26suggested a clinically meaningful improvement in 6MWT of up to 40 m which was selected to inform the sample size of our study. The estimated sample size to detect a dif- ference of 40 m with a SD of 56 m (derived from the higher SD reported by Tang et al.26) at 80% power and5% alpha was 62 participants.We aimed to recruit at least 70 patients to enable dropouts and ensure that 4- week primary outcome data were collected for at least 62 patients.Secondary endpoints included exercise capacity (6MWT) at 12 weeks; and ferritin, TSAT and Hb, urea, creatinine, eGFR, VO 2peak test (in a subset of partic- ipants), muscle strength, sit-to-stand 60, KDQOL-36 questionnaire, the WSAS questionnaire, the Chalder Fatigue questionnaire, and adverse events at 4 and 12 weeks.Serious adverse events were identi ﬁed and docu- mented at routine visits, based on participant reports,and primary or secondary care reports.
In addition, episodes of infection requiring hospitalization and other infection episodes and cases of vascular access thrombosis were documented. Hb, SF, platelet levels, and other laboratory measurements detailed above were monitored.Qualitative exploration of participant experience, phosphocreatine recovery half-time on magnetic reso- nance imaging spectroscopy, muscle metabolism, and the impact of iron therapy on iron regulatory genes (HFE, TMPRSS6 ) were measured as part of the study but are not reported here.Statistical Analyses A full description of the statistical analysis plan, including COVID-19 considerations, is reported else- where.21All data were analyzed in accordance with an intention-to-treat principle.
For the primary outcome, the difference in means for distance walked during 6MWT (meters) at 4 weeks (primary outcome) between patients randomized to IV iron therapy and placebo were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model, using baseline 6MWT distance and the binary strati- ﬁcation variable SF (de ﬁned as whether baseline SF is over 50 mg/l) as covariates. The analysis of covariance were also performed for the 6MWT distance (meters) at12 weeks, and for the other secondary end points.In each case, the baseline value of the variables and the binary strati ﬁcation factor were used as covariates.All analyses were undertaken in R and Stata version 17 (IBM Corp.Released 2017, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0, Armonk, NY).We investi- gated whether any impact of COVID-19 break on the primary end point and 12 week ’s end points in a sensitivity analysis.Data Monitoring and Quality Assurance The trial was coordinated by a trial management group.
A trial steering committee was established to oversee the conduct and progress of the trial. An independentCLINICAL RESEARCH SA Greenwood et al.: Iron Therapy in Iron-De ﬁcient Non-Anemic Patients 1498 Kidney International Reports (2023) 8,1496 –1505 data monitoring committee monitored patient safety and treatment ef ﬁcacy data.RESULTS Baseline Characteristics of Randomized Participants The baseline characteristics of the full trial population are published elsewhere.21Brieﬂy, 75 participants were randomized including 32 (43%) males.The mean (SD) age was 57 (14) years.The characteristics of the 2 groups of the trial were similar at baseline, although there was a 7-year age difference between treatmentgroup ( n¼38; mean [SD] age 54 [16] years) and placebo group ( n¼37; mean [SD] age 61[12] years).There was a larger proportion of comorbidities in the treatment group, than in the placebo group.
There was a larger proportion of females in the placebo group compared to the IV iron group (65% vs. 50%), and there was a difference in the mean (SD) baseline distance covered during the 6MWT (384 [195] meters in the treatment group vs.469 [142] meters in placebo treated patients,Table 1 ).Overall, about half of patients (49%) were recruited before the COVID-19 break and similarly in each arm (47% and 51% in IV Iron and placebo, respectively).A CONSORT diagram is included as Supplementary Figure S1 .Primary End Point: 6MWT At 4 weeks, the mean change from baseline in 6MWT was -4 (71) meters in 31 patients who received IV iron compared to 14 (37) meters in 31 patients who received placebo ( P¼0.261) ( Table 2 ).Exercise Training Exercise training, as per prescribed training protocol, was achieved by 16 of the 23 (70%) participants in the iron therapy group and by 16 of the 20 (80%) partic- ipants in the control group before the 12-week assessment.
Secondary Outcomes At 12 weeks, the mean change from baseline in 6MWT was 44 (103) meters for 22 patients who received IV iron compared to 20 (45) meters for 20 patients who received placebo ( P¼0.338) ( Table 2 ). There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference for SF and TSAT at both 4 weeks (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) and 12 weeks (P<0.001 and P¼0.001, respectively) from baseline, with greater increases in the treatment group ( Table 3 ).There was no statistically signi ﬁcant difference in Hb at 4 weeks ( P¼0.66); however, there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference at 12 weeks ( P<0.001).Kidney function as assessed by serum creatinine and eGFR were similar in both study arms with no signi ﬁcantdifference between iron therapy and placebo at 4 and 12 weeks.Proteinuria did not change with time or with IV iron treatment ( Table 3 ).There were no signi ﬁcant differences in adverse events between study arms(Supplementary Table S1 ).
There were no signi ﬁcant differences between groups at 4 or 12 weeks in VO 2peak test (in a subset of par- ticipants), muscle strength, sit-to-stand 60, KDQOL-36 questionnaire, the WSAS questionnaire, or the Chalder Fatigue questionnaire scores ( Table 4 ) and there were no signiﬁcant differences between the 2 groups at 4 or 12 weeks for muscle strength ( Supplementary Table S2 ). In a sensitivity analysis, there was no association be- tween the primary end point and the before or after COVID-19 break status.In the after-break group, the 4 weeks 6MWT average was 19 m greater than in the before-break (432 m and 413 m, respectively).Two- thirds of patients completing their 12 weeks follow-up were recruited after the break.The 12 weeks 6MWT average was 88 m less in the after-break compared to the before-break (421 m and 509 m respectively); however, given the small sample size, there was no evidence of signiﬁcant association ( P¼0.100).
In exploratory analyses, when compared with baseline values, there was a greater than 25 m increase in 6MWT observed in 8 of 31 (26%) patients at 4 weeks and 10 of 22 (45%) at 12 weeks among those who received treatment compared with 7 of 31 (23% at 4 weeks) and 7 of 20 (35% at 12 weeks) among patients who received placebo, respectively. Similarly, a greater than 25 m increase in 6MWT was observed in 10 of 23 (43%) patients who received treatment versus 4 of 20 (20%) patients who received placebo between 4 and 12weeks.A greater than 25 m increase in 6MWT was observed in 8 of 16 (50%) patients who received treatment and exercise training per protocol versus 4 of 16 (25%) patients who received placebo and exercise training per protocol between 4 and 12 weeks.
Baseline characteristics for the participants included in these exploratory analyses were broadly representative of the study population as a whole, with a higher baseline 6MWT distance observed in the placebo group of 454 (160) m versus 379 (220) m in the treatment group (See Supplementary Table S3 ). DISCUSSION The Iron and Muscle Trial investigated whether a single dose of 1000 mg of IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose [Ferinject]) improves exercise capacity in comparison to placebo at 4 weeks after IV iron therapy in nonanemic patients with CKD who have iron-de ﬁciency.Our study also explored the additional value of an 8-week exercise training regime between 4 and 12 weeks.SA Greenwood et al.: Iron Therapy in Iron-De ﬁcient Non-Anemic Patients CLINICAL RESEARCH Kidney International Reports (2023) 8,1496 –1505 1499 Table 1.

There were also no signiﬁcant between-group differences in measures of muscle strength, physical function, aerobic capacity, fatigue, work and social adjustment, or health-related quality of life. Ourﬁndings are comparable with those reported in the Iron and Heart Trial,18which did not reveal any signiﬁcant change in 6MWT distance at 4 weeks post iron infusion in patients with CKD, and only a modest but nonsigni ﬁcant improvement in summary component score in Quality of Life Short Form 36 scores when compared with placebo.Our ﬁndings contrast with ﬁndings from studies of patients with heart failure,8-10which demonstrated improvements inexercise capacity after iron therapy when compared with placebo.Like the Iron and Heart Trial,18our trial had a small sample size, a short follow-up period, and there was a relatively well-preserved 6MWT distance at baseline in both groups.
Higher baseline values may have limited the margin for improvement that was achieved in studies of patients with heart failure where the baseline values were more than 100 meters less. Comorbidities may have impacted the walk distance atbaseline, and subsequently impacted the follow-up result.In addition, it is plausible that the dose of iron, and the frequency at which it was administered, may have been insuf ﬁcient to improve cellular energetics.Our results revealed a numerical (42 m), although nonsigni ﬁcant, mean improvement in 6MWT distance between 4 and 12 weeks in patients who received IVTable 1.

Indeed, despite the inclusion of prescribed exercise training between 4 and 12 weeks, which was achieved by a similar number of participants in both groups (n¼16), there was a small decline in the numerical mean 6MWT distance achieved in the placebo group.
The numerical improvement in mean 6MWT distance reported in patients who received IV iron, accompanied by a mean numerical nonsigni ﬁcant improvement in sit-to stand physical function score, could be due to a combination of the iron therapy and additional exercise training that was introduced to all study participants at 4 weeks. Exploratory analyses revealed a larger pro- portion (50%) of participants who were exposed to irontherapy plus exercise training per protocol exceeding the clinically relevant improvement of 25 m distance in the 6MWT distance, versus the placebo group plus exercise training per protocol (25%).Combining exer- cise training with iron therapy may target the disease- related derangements in the oxygen transport chain and result in more pronounced physiological adapta- tions to exercise in those participants exposed to the combined intervention.20The study was however not designed to investigate this mechanism of action.
The sample size is too small, and it is acknowledged that theexploratory analysis no longer bene ﬁts from randomi- zation and may therefore be subject to substantial confounding. It is dif ﬁcult to rule out the phenomenon of regression to the mean, given the substantialdifference in baseline 6 minute walked distance be- tween the placebo and iron treated groups.The dif- ferences may be attributable to the impact of exercise comparing one population with a greater degree of mobility impairment to another.This potential com-plementary intervention to promote physical function and exercise capacity is nonetheless interesting and hypothesis generating for future studies.Our study did not reveal between-group differences in fatigue or WSAS, with both groups improving the mean scores of these patients ’reported outcomes.The impact on emotional wellbeing from being a part of research studies, regardless of treatment allocation, has been reported in other studies.
27The impact of iron therapy on these important patient-reported outcomes may be explored further in larger studies with longer participant follow-up. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines recommends the use of iron therapy in patients with CKD with an SF of <500mg/l or a TSAT #30% if it is desired to increase Hb or to reduce erythropoiesis stimulating agent therapy.28In our trial, there were signi ﬁcant differences in Hb concentrations between arms at 12 weeks, with pa- tients receiving IV iron therapy demonstrating a sig-niﬁcant mean improvement.There are few safety data available regarding effects of increasing Hb concen- trations in patients with CKD who are nonanemic but iron-de ﬁcient, with clinicians often displayingTable 3.

The strengths of the Iron and Muscle Trial include the representative patient sample from all ethnicities, when compared with previous studies,29the double- blinded nature of the trial, and the novel inclusion of exercise training as a potential complementary inter- vention to iron therapy. The limitations include the small sample size, which is likely to have contributed to the baseline imbalance of the 6MWT; and short follow-up period.The singledose of 1000 mg of ferric carboxymaltose iron therapy may require further investigation because recent studies, such as the NIMO study,30suggest it may not be a suf ﬁcient dose to achieve complete iron repletion and thus alter cellular energetics.Conclusions This randomized controlled trial showed that, among nonanemic patients with CKD, iron-de ﬁciency, and a relatively well preserved 6 MWT distance at baseline, IV iron therapy did not i mpact on exercise and functional capacity, qua lity of life, or patient- reported outcomes.
Higher baseline physical perfor- mance scores in the control arm might have impacted these outcomes. Adequately powered studies, with sufﬁcient participant follow-up, are warranted to investigate functional improvement in nonanemic patients with iron-de ﬁciency and CKD who are treated with IV iron.Table 4.
