VDR expression in hepatocytes, however, is low in healthy liver, and the role of VDR in hepatocyte pro-liferation is unclear. Methods: In these studies, hepatocyte-VDR null mice (hVDR) were used to assessthe role of VDR and vitamin D signaling in hepatic regener-ation.Mice underwent 2/3 partial hepatectomy and liver re-generation and function were studied.Results: hVDR mice had impaired liver regeneration with impaired hepatocyteproliferation.This was associated with signi ﬁcant differen- tial changes in bile salts.Notably, mice lacking hepatocyteVDR had signi ﬁcant increases in expression of conjugated bile acids after partial hepatectomy, consistent with failureto normalize hepatic function by the 14-day time pointtested.CDCA (chenodeoxycholate) is an FXR ligand, whichwas increased after surgery in controls but not in hVDRmice.FXR signaling is important for hepatocyte prolifer-ation.
Real-time PCR of hVDR and control livers showedsigniﬁcant changes in expression of cell cycle genes includ- ing cyclins D1 and E1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Geneexpression pro ﬁling of hepatocytes treated with vitamin D or control showed regulation of groups of genes involved in liver proliferation, hepatitis, liver hyperplasia / hyper- proliferation and liver necrosis / cell death.Conclusions: Together these studies demonstrate an important function-al role for VDR in hepatocytes during liver regeneration.Combined with the known pro ﬁbrotic effects of impaired VDR signaling in stellate cells, these studies provide amechanism whereby vitamin D de ﬁciency would bothreduce hepatocyte proliferation and permit ﬁbrosis, leading to signi ﬁcant liver compromise.
