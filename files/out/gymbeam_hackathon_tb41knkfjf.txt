Pharmacological options are at the center of therapeutic algorithms in treating rheu- matic diseases, particularly in reducing inflammation. Despite significant advances in pharmacological treatment in recent years, achieving complete treatment success in a group of patients is impossible.Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases frequently utilize alternative treatment options, such as complementary and alternative medicine.Complementary and alterna- tive medicine is a broad category of health practices not part of the leading health system.Patients with rheumatic diseases turn to complementary and alternative medicine for various reasons, including restricted access to some treatments due to high prices and rigorous regulations, worries about drug side effects, and symptoms that continue despite pharmacological treatment.
In addition, because complementary and alternative medicine options are considered natural, they are frequently accepted as well tolerated and have few harmful effects. Ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia syndrome are the primary foci of this comprehensive review.First, we attempted to summarize the non-traditional physi - cal medicine and complementary and alternative medicine options that can be utilized to manage these diseases.Second, we addressed the link between exercise and inflammation in rheumatic diseases.We briefly discussed the possible benefits of exercise-based approaches.In addition, we highlighted the benefits of cooperation between rheumatology and physical medicine-rehabilitation clinics.Keywords Ankylosing spondylitis · Spondyloarthritis · Rheumatoid arthritis · Fibromyalgia · Complementary therapies · Exercise Introduction Rheumatic diseases involve various musculoskeletal, arthritic, connective tissue, and vasculitic diseases [1 ].
Rheumatic diseases are associated with negative effects on daily living activities, a decrease in productivity and work efficiency, certain levels of disability, and deterioration in the quality of life [2 ]. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the pharmacological treatment of rheu- matic diseases.However, some patients do not respond ade- quately to the main medical treatments.Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases often choose different treatment options, such as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods [3 , 4].CAM is defined as a wide range of health practices not integrated into the dominant health system [5 ].Alterna- tive medical systems, biologics, manipulative interven- tions, mind–body and cognitive techniques, and energy- based healing procedures are the major categories of CAM methods [ 6].
There are several reasons why patients with rheumatic diseases resort to CAM methods, such as limited * Burhan Fatih Kocyigit bfk2701@hotmail.com 1 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam University, Kahramanmaraş, Turkey 2 Department of Biology and Biochemistry, South Kazakhstan Medical Academy, Shymkent, Kazakhstan 3 Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Application and Research Center, Hasan Kalyoncu University, Gaziantep, Turkey 618 Rheumatology International (2023) 43:617–625 1 3 access to some drugs due to high costs and strict regulations, concerns about drug side effects, and symptoms that persist despite medications. Since CAM methods are considered natural, they are often regarded as well tolerated and have minimal adverse events [7 ].
Exercise interventions have been suggested as an essential component of routine care for those suffering from diseases covering inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fibromy - algia syndrome (FMS) [8 ]. Therefore, exercise and physi- cal medicine practices are essential in managing rheumatic diseases.This comprehensive review focused on three major rheu- matic diseases: ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and FMS.We aimed to summarize the non- traditional physical medicine and CAM methods that can be used to manage these diseases.Additionally, we discussed why physical medicine-rehabilitation and rheumatology clinics should collaborate.Search strategy A search procedure was created based on the suggestions of Gasparyan et al.[9 ].
First, the following term combinations were used to search for articles in Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and DOAJ: ‘Ankylosing Spondylitis and Pilates’ or ‘Ankylosing Spondylitis and Massage’ or ‘Ankylosing Spondylitis and Balneotherapy’ or ‘Ankylos - ing Spondylitis and Spa Therapy’ or ‘Ankylosing Spondy - litis and Yoga’ or ‘Ankylosing Spondylitis and Tai Chi’ or ‘Ankylosing Spondylitis and Acupuncture’ or ‘Ankylosing Spondylitis and Nutritional Therapy’ or ‘Ankylosing Spon- dylitis and Hypnotherapy’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Pilates’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Massage’ or ‘Spondy - loarthropathy and Balneotherapy’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Spa Therapy’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Yoga’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Tai Chi’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Acupuncture’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Nutritional Therapy’ or ‘Spondyloarthropathy and Hypnotherapy’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Pilates’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Massage’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Balneotherapy’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Spa Therapy’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Yoga’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Tai Chi’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Acupuncture’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Nutritional Therapy’ or ‘Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hypnotherapy’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Pilates’ or ‘Fibro- myalgia and Massage’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Balneotherapy’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Spa Therapy’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Yoga’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Tai Chi’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Acupuncture’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Nutritional Therapy’ or ‘Fibromyalgia and Hypnotherapy'.
We only used controlled clinical trials, observational studies, reviews, and English- language papers. Other article types and papers not directly related to the issue were among the exclusion criteria.Pilates Pilates is a method of physical training centered on mind–body relaxation, emphasizing regulated movement, posture, and respiration.The main goal is to improve strength and flexibility considerably [10].Although Pilates programs are primarily aimed at healthy individuals as a component of fitness activities, it has been reported to have beneficial effects on various musculoskeletal system disorders in recent years [11].A randomized controlled trial in AS patients found that pilates improved physical capacity at a 24-week follow- up [12].Another randomized controlled trial emphasized the efficacy of pilates as part of a multimodal exercise program in managing AS [13].Oksuz et al.
[14] divided AS patients into two groups and recommended a pilates program combined with aerobic exercise to group 1 and aerobic exercise alone to group 2. It was shown that the combined intervention is more effective regarding func- tionality and psychosocial status.Although it was revealed that the Pilates program improved respiratory muscle strength in AS patients, it was not superior to conventional exercise [15].The number of articles evaluating the effectiveness of pilates in RA patients is limited.Yentur et al.[16] divided RA patients into three groups.Pilates was applied to the first group, aerobic exercise to the second group, and a combination of the two to the third group.Participants were followed throughout 8 weeks.In the Pilates group, positive effects were observed on fatigue, quality of life, aerobic capacity, and depression.However, the three groups were not superior to each other.
It is difficult to produce precise results due to the short follow-up period and the insufficient sample size. Altan et al.[17] divided FMS patients into two groups.Pilates was recommended to the first group, and relaxation and stretching exercises were recommended to the second group.Pain and disease activity improved in the Pilates group.In addition, the Pilates group's improvement was superior to the second group.A randomized controlled trial compared mat Pilates with aquatic aerobic exercise.In both groups, alleviation of FMS-related symptoms was detected in the 12-week follow-up.There was no superi- ority between the two groups [18].Another randomized controlled trial comparing mat Pilates with aquatic aerobic exercise found that Pilates had a similar effect as aquatic aerobic exercise in FMS patients [19].Pilates can be considered a different, safe, and poten- tially effective exercise approach in AS, RA, and FMS management.
However, the number of high-quality articles is limited, particularly for RA patients. In addition, the lack of studies on the mechanism of action of Pilates in 619 Rheumatology International (2023) 43:617–625 1 3 rheumatic diseases is striking.Therefore, the influences of Pilates on pain mediators, inflammatory indicators, and oxidative stress parameters in patients with AS, RA, and FMS should be evaluated in future studies.Massage Massage therapy is one of the oldest methods to reduce pain, relieve muscle spasms and improve quality of life.Massage therapy can be defined as the manipulation and mobilization of soft tissue and joint structures with the help of hands or a hand-held instrument [20].Various mechanisms have been proposed for the effect of massage on pain, such as gate control theory and increased endorphin levels [21].The number of articles evaluating the effectiveness of massage in AS patients is limited.
In a randomized clinical trial, AS patients were divided into two groups, with one group receiving deep tissue massage and the other receiving therapeutic massage. Both groups reported favorable clini- cal outcomes [22].However, the lack of a control group, the small sample size, and the short follow-up period are the article's shortcomings, and the results are difficult to generalize.A randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of Swedish massage in RA.The patients were divided into two as control and massage groups.After 8 weeks of interven- tion, the pain level was lower in the massage group, and the need for painkillers was reduced [23].Another randomized controlled trial separated RA patients into three groups: aromatherapy massage, reflexology, and control.It was stated that massage and reflexology positively affect pain and fatigue [24].Sevgi Ünal Aslan et al.[25] divided RA patients into Reiki, hand massage, and control groups.
The favorable influences of Reiki and hand massage on pain and fatigue were reported. Toprak Celenay et al.[26] divided FMS patients into two groups.The first group received only exercise, while the second received both exercise and connective tissue mas- sage.Exercise plus connective tissue massage was superior to exercise alone in relieving pain, fatigue, sleep disorder, and role constraints related to physical health.In addition, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated that more than 5 weeks of massage intervention had ben- eficial short-term effects on improving pain, anxiety, and depression in FMS patients [27].A meta-analysis investigat- ing the effectiveness of massage therapy types in FMS stated that most types of massage enhance the quality of life [28].Massage therapy provides short-term favorable effects, particularly on pain, exhaustion, sleep disturbance, and qual- ity of life indices.
However, there has yet to be a consen- sus on the application technique, duration, and frequency. Furthermore, the methodological shortcomings of existing articles should be considered.Balneotherapy Balneotherapy has been employed in treating musculo- skeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases since ancient times.Balneotherapy encompasses immersion in baths containing thermal or thermo-mineral water from natu- ral sources and mud and other natural peloid applications [29].Although the exact mechanism of balneotherapy has not been revealed, possible mechanisms are thermal stimulation, the effect of mineral salt composition in bath applications, and the reflection of mud packs’ physical and chemical properties [30].A randomized controlled study conducted on AS patients reported that balneotherapy improved disease activity, qual- ity of life, and functionality in the short term.Still, some beneficial effects were lost in mid-term follow-up [31].Bestaş et al.
[32] divided AS patients into three groups and followed up prospectively. Balneotherapy was recommended to the first group, water-based exercises to the second group, and land-based exercises to the third group.It was suggested that all three treatment modalities are effective in disease activity, functionality, quality of life, and mobility and are not superior to each other.In a systematic review, it was emphasized that studies are reporting the beneficial effects of balneotherapy, but studies with large samples and without methodological flaws are needed to provide clear conclu- sions [33].The positive effects of balneotherapy on disease activ - ity and functionality were demonstrated in RA patients.On the other hand, it was reported that the effects diminish in long-term follow-up [34, 35].Spa treatment with saline balneotherapy was found to have an antioxidant effect in RA patients, but the influence on clinical findings is unclear [36].
The beneficial results of balneotherapy sessions were presented by a systematic review analyzing the effects of balneotherapy on the quality of life in RA patients [37]. However, a Cochrane review reported insufficient evidence to reveal balneotherapy's effectiveness in RA patients.In addition, the risk of bias and methodological shortcomings were highlighted [38].The beneficial effects of balneotherapy on FMS-related symptoms were demonstrated in several studies [39– 43].It was determined that interleukin 1, prostaglandin E2, and leu- kotriene B4 levels, associated with pain and inflammation, decreased following balneotherapy in FMS patients [44].In addition, balneotherapy was found to have an antioxidant effect in FMS patients [ 45].It was reported that combin - ing balneotherapy with aerobic exercise is more effective than aerobic exercise alone or balneotherapy alone [46].
In a meta-analysis, very low to moderate evidence suggest that balneotherapy can improve pain and quality of life in FMS patients and have a variable effect on tenderness and depres- sion [47]. 620 Rheumatology International (2023) 43:617–625 1 3 Yoga Yoga is a set of practices originating from India and dat- ing back to ancient times, including postural adjustments, breathing exercises techniques, and relaxation approaches.Studies show its positive effects on musculoskeletal dis- orders [48– 50].However, investigations with a high level of evidence evaluating the effectiveness of yoga in AS patients are limited.Combining stretching exercises with proper breathing techniques is part of yoga practice.This condition suggests that yoga may positively affect AS [7 ].A randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of tele-yoga on AS patients during the COVID-19 era observed improvements in physical function and psychological state [51].
It has been demonstrated that yoga interventions are practicable and acceptable in AS [52]. Badsha et al.[53] assessed the efficiency of an 8-week structured yoga program in RA patients, and significant ameliorations were detected in the patient group (disease activity and global health status) compared to controls.However, there was no similar positive effect on the quality of life.A meta-analysis published in 2020 evaluated yoga's effectiveness in RA patients.The results supported that yoga may positively affect physical function, disease activity, and grip strength.However, there was no improvement in pain level, markers of inflammation, and the number of tender joints [54].A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of the Yoga daily life program in RA patients.Although it did not affect the quality of life, fatigue and psychological state benefits were reported [55].
The efficacy of an 8-week structured yoga program on FMS syndrome was investigated in a randomized controlled trial and found improvement in pain, psychological state, and fatigue [56]. In addition, a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of meditative treatment options in FMS revealed that yoga was beneficial and a safe practice on the main clinical signs of FMS [57].Yoga seems to be an effective treatment option for vari- ous clinical manifestations of rheumatic diseases.However, inadequacy in sample sizes, methodological flaws, and risk of bias draw attention to yoga studies.Therefore, articles with a higher level of evidence are needed [58].Tai Chi Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese meditative practice that dates back to ancient times.It integrates deep diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation techniques with a series of gentle and controlled basic postures.
Its goal is to unify the physi- cal, psychological, social, and behavioral components and to increase inner harmony by strengthening and stretching the soft tissues [59]. In a controlled clinical study conducted on AS patients, an 8-week Tai Chi program was reported to impact disease activity and flexibility positively [60].Patients with AS were divided into two groups in a ran- domized controlled clinical trial.One group was given a home exercise program, whereas the other group received Tai Chi movements in addition to the home exercise pro- gram.Although both groups reported positive outcomes, the Tai Chi group experienced more significant improvements in disease activity and quality of life [61].Uhlig et al.[ 62] assessed the efficacy of Tai Chi in RA patients quantitatively and qualitatively.At the end of the 12-week follow-up period, improvements in lower extrem- ity muscle function, physical performance, pain, and bal- ance were observed.Shin et al.
[ 63] evaluated the impact of Tai Chi on endothelial function and arterial stiffness in RA patients. After the program, assessments for endothelial function and arterial stiffness were substantially better in the Tai Chi group.No considerable differences were detected between the intervention and control groups in disease activ - ity and disability parameters.A Cochrane review published in 2019 emphasized that Tai Chi's effect on RA is unclear.Due to the low level of evidence, a critical impact cannot be confirmed or excluded [64].In a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a 12-week classical Tai Chi program on FMS patients, the intervention group showed more significant improvement in disease activity and quality of life indicators.In addition, well-being continued at the 24-week evaluation [65].
A ran- domized controlled study comparing the effects of Tai Chi and aerobic exercise in FMS patients found that Tai Chi had a similar impact with aerobic exercise and was even supe- rior in some parameters [66]. A meta-analysis reported that Tai Chi is more beneficial than standard care in FMS.Fur - thermore, this meta-analysis emphasized that studies with a higher level of evidence are needed to recommend Tai Chi as an alternative to established treatment options such as aerobic exercise [67].Another randomized controlled trial suggested that Tai Chi improved sympathovagal balance in FMS [68].This low-cost and efficient symptom management option is a promising method that can be incorporated into the treat- ment strategies of patients with AS, RA, and FMS.How - ever, multicenter, large sample and high-evidence studies are required.
Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment modality used for over four thousand years in China and is considered an essential com - ponent of traditional Chinese medicine. Thin needles are implanted at certain places on the body for treatment, and a manipulation technique is performed.Acupuncture treat- ment aims to relieve symptoms and improve well-being by 621 Rheumatology International (2023) 43:617–625 1 3 stimulating meridians and acupuncture points and involves many different application techniques [69, 70].A combination of needling, moxibustion, and other tra - ditional Chinese medicine procedures is frequently used to gain greater efficacy in AS patients.In warm acupuncture, acupuncture and moxibustion are used together [71].The meta-analysis by Xuan et al.[72] aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of needling alone in AS patients.
Although beneficial results were reported in this meta-analysis, which included randomized controlled trials, emphasis was placed on methodological shortcomings and low quality of evidence. The authors argued in a systematic review that acupunc- ture, alone or in conjunction with other modalities, is help- ful for clinical signs of RA, has no notable adverse effects, and can enhance the functional status and quality of life.It was suggested that there could be several underlying mech- anisms, including anti-inflammatory effects, antioxidative alterations, and regulation of immune system function [ 73].In their meta-analysis, Lu et al.[74] found that acupuncture improved clinical signs and laboratory parameters in RA patients.However, some articles did not report favorable effects [75, 76].This condition suggests that the efficacy of acupuncture in RA patients should be confirmed by research with high methodological quality and large samples.
In a meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of acu- puncture in FMS patients, a considerable favorable effect was found in reducing pain and maintaining well-being [77]. Kim et al.[78] supported these findings in their meta- analysis.Zheng et al.[79] reported moderate evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness on FMS-related pain, but found no effect on fatigue, stiffness, sleep quality, and physical function.A Cochrane review evaluating the efficacy of acu- puncture on FMS reported low to moderate evidence that acupuncture improves pain and stiffness compared to stand- ard therapy.Furthermore, moderate evidence was presented that there was no difference between sham acupuncture and therapeutic acupuncture in pain, sleep, stiffness, and well- being [80].Nutritional therapy In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the asso- ciation between nutrition and gut microbiome, as well as inflammation and oxidative stress in rheumatic diseases.
A systematic review emphasized that the evidence for a link between diet and AS was extremely limited due to the poor sample size, bias risk, and inadequate data reporting in most of the enrolled studies [81]. Some articles support the potential relationship between diet and oxidative stress in AS patients and suggest that positive effects can be obtained on disease activity by increasing adherence to the Mediter - ranean diet [82, 83].Schonenberger et al.[84] investigated the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory diets (Mediterranean, vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic) in RA patients in a systematic review and reported positive results on pain.However, there was an emphasis on the high risk of bias and low level of evidence.Some studies showed curcumin supplementation improves inflammatory markers in RA patients [85, 86].Probiotic sup- plementation may have benefits on CRP and RA activity, according to a meta-analysis assessing the effect of probiot- ics on RA.
However, the level of evidence is low, and het- erogeneity is evident [87]. There was insufficient evidence to support collagen supplementation in RA [88].In a systematic review analyzing the effect of several types of diets on FMS, the results for nutritional therapy were considered to be but contentious promising.The emphasis was on poor methodological quality for articles on this topic [89].Another systematic review investigating the impact of vegan and vegetarian diets on FMS found positive and promising results on pain, sleep, and quality of life.Still, it noted the low methodological quality [90].A randomized controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of tryptophan and magnesium-enriched Mediterranean diet and found ben- eficial effects on anxiety, mood status, and eating disorder.However, no impact on sleep quality was detected [91].There are promising results that various dietary interven- tions can be beneficial for AS, RA, and FMS.
However, it is challenging to recommend a uniform diet. The methodo- logical quality of the studies in the literature is poor, and the bias risk is remarkable.Studies with higher methodological quality and larger samples are needed in this area.Hypnotherapy There is inadequate data to assess the efficacy of hypno- therapy in AS.Horton-Hausknecht et al.[92] evaluated the effectiveness of hypnosis therapy in RA patients.Although hypnosis therapy was observed to positively impact objec- tive and subjective findings, the results should be interpreted with caution.First, the sample size is limited.In the article, three groups were formed hypnotherapy, relaxation, and con- trol.There was a statistically significant difference between the three groups regarding age, education level, and disease duration.Bernardy et al.[93] conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of hypnotherapy in FMS.
Unfortunately, the evidence for the effectiveness of hypnotherapy in reducing pain at the end of therapy was not robust against methodological bias risks. Furthermore, it was linked with poor methodological research quality.Nevertheless, a randomized controlled trial evaluating hyp- nosis therapy in FMS patients found improvement in pain, fatigue, and depression [94].Another systematic review sup- ported using a combination of hypnotherapy and cognitive 622 Rheumatology International (2023) 43:617–625 1 3 behavioral therapy to manage FMS core symptoms.How - ever, it was presented with a low level of evidence that hyp- notherapy effectively reduces pain and improves psychologi- cal state [95].Physical medicine‑rehabilitation and rheumatology clinics collaboration Pharmacological interventions are at the center of the treat- ment of rheumatic diseases.
Unfortunately, despite the sig- nificant advances of recent years, it is still not possible to achieve favorable outcomes for all patients. Therefore, it is preferable not to rely solely on pharmaceutical treatment alternatives.Exercise is essential to preserving and improv - ing general health and quality of life, not only in rheumatic diseases but also in many other diseases and even in healthy people.Furthermore, it is impossible to discontinue exer - cise practices to treat rheumatic diseases such as AS, FMS, and osteoarthritis.Therefore, it is appropriate to implement individualized exercise programs or recommend home pro- grams in physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics after gathering necessary information about the patient's medi- cal condition from the rheumatology clinic and physician while adhering to the principles of FITT.
In addition, some patients with rheumatic diseases may require individualized rehabilitation applications and orthotics–prosthesis recom- mendations due to contracture, respiratory–cardiac function impairment, and gait disruption. Rheumatologists can obtain views regarding CAM applications from physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics for patients they deem appropriate.Given all of these considerations, it is evident that physical medicine—rehabilitation, and rheumatology clinics should be in constant communication and collaborate as needed.Due to the predominant involvement of the musculoskel- etal system, exercise, rehabilitation interventions, and CAM applications should be positioned appropriately within the treatment programs for rheumatic diseases.Conclusion, limitations, and future suggestions Physical medicine and CAM methods are safe approaches to managing AS, RA, and FMS.Although favorable results have been reported, the level of evidence for many CAM methods is low.
The main reasons for this outcome are methodological flaws such as limited sample size, bias risk, short follow-up periods, and challenges in creating control groups. Another issue is that there is no agreement in CAM approaches on the frequency of interventions and the number of sessions.This situation causes heterogene- ity in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.To overcome these obstacles, researchers should focus on studies that reduce methodological flaws.Furthermore, researchers should concentrate on the mechanisms of action of these approaches and attempt to understand the biological basis for their impacts on inflammation and pain.Although phar - macological treatments are at the core of managing AS, RA, and FMS, exercise-based interventions and CAM methods should be placed in appropriate positions within the treat- ment programs.Author contributions Study design: BFK, ZS, MY, and AA.Data acquisition and review of the literature: BFK and AA.
