Oxidative stressdue to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) raises nu-merous problems related to male infertility, like spermdamage and sperm deformity [2]. ,K_he pathophysiologicalorigins of infertility include hypogonadotropic hypo-gonadism (HH), coital disorders, erectile dysfunction, andejaculation disorder.In male HH, testes fail to produceandrogen and sperms, resulting in congenital or acquireddiseases, aﬀecting hypothalamus and/or the pituitary gland.Spermatogenesis and androgen production are maintained and induced in HH by exogenous regulation of gonado-tropins, permitting natural fertility in several cases [3].Clomiphene citrate and selective estrogen receptor modu-lator (SERM) are mainly used to treat HH [4–6].Several heavy metals cause the male infertility, such as cadmium,lead,andmercury.Acutecadmiumpoisoningcanlead to hepatic and testicular injury.Ototoxicity, severetesticular hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis have resultedfrom chronic exposure to cadmium.
Cadmium 21 is theanalogueofcadmium,whichistoxictohumansandanimals [7]. Cadmium absorption occurs in human by ingestion or inhalation of the food containing cadmium.Mostly, cad-mium present in terrestrial foods is absorbed into the body.Cadmium is used in batteries, metal plating, pigments, andin plastics and alloy industries.Human exposure to cad-miumoccursecologicallyorbyoccupationalways.Ingestionof food, drinking water, contaminated soil and dust, ciga-rette,smoking,anddietaryconsumptionarethemaincausesof cadmium exposure to human [8].Cadmium inactivatesthe enzyme containing sulfhydryl groups.It also causes theuncouplingofoxidativephosphorylationinmitochondriaof the cell.Moreover, it competes with other metals (e.g., Zn and selenium) for attachment to metalloenzymes and withcalcium for binding sites (e.g., calmodulin on regulatoryproteins).
Cadmium develops the oxidative stress in thediﬀerent organs by acute poisoning and causes severe de-generative changes in most tissues leading to osteomalacia,hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, infertility, andcancer [9]. Oxidative stress is implicated in several human diseases includingbutnotlimitedtoatherosclerosis,cancer,diabetes,rheumatoid arthritis, inﬂammatory bowel disease, Parkin-son’s disease, and infertility [10].Although small amount of ROS is beneﬁcial for fertilization, the excessive amounts of ROS and nitric oxide (NO) promote capacitation and ac-rosomal reaction, thus adversely aﬀecting spermatogenesis.Even the lipid peroxidation resulting from low level of ROScausestheplasmamembranemodiﬁcationandfacilitatestheadhesion of sperm-oocyte.,K_hese prooxidants are thenshiftedtothesemenandvaginalsecretions,whichultimatelycause the infertility [11].
Morphologically abnormal sper-matozoa are produced by the ROS in the infertile menhaving low capacity of the antioxidants and less spermmotility. In the seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic men,the ROS activity is associated with the chain-breaking an-tioxidants [12].Dietary and endogenous antioxidants in-cluding low level of chain-breaking antioxidants (CBA) areindicated to treat reduced spermatogenesis and testicularstress [13].Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) protects from thrombolysis, congestive heart failure (CHF), essential hypertension, re-novascular hypertension, and ventricular arrhythmia inaddition to stroke, retinopathy, and muscular dystrophy.Moreover, CoQ10 is widely distributed to diﬀerent bodyorgansandexhibitsalonghalf-life[14].Lycopenebelongstocarotenoids, which are the main sources of vitaminA.Lycopene possesses the antioxidant properties and isnaturally found in fruits and vegetables.
Lycopene inhibitsvarious human cancer cells, prevents DNA damage, and ismore potent than α- andß-carotenes [15]. L-Carnitine (LC) belongs to carnitines, which are highly polar compounds, broadly distributed in nature.Within themale genital tract, carnitines are concentrated in the epi-didymis and spermatozoa [12].Carnitines are also frequentlyused inthetreatment ofmale infertility,chronicrenal failure,and erythropoietin resistant anemia [16].Zinc (Zn) is anessential trace element that acts as a cofactor involved indeoxyribonucleicacid(DNA)proﬁlingandproteinsynthesis.Furthermore, Zn has also antiapoptotic and antioxidantproperties.Znisusefulinthetreatmentofasthenozoospermicmale infertility.It improves the sperm integrity, conception,and pregnancy rates.Zn also plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolic ﬂexibility and stabilization of sperm membrane [17].Lack of Zn is related to the compromised spermfunctioning and enhancement of oxidative stress in seminalplasma.
Moreover, Zn is also important in the regulation ofvariousprocesses,forexample,capacitationandtheacrosomereaction of sperm for conception and embryonic implanta-tion [18]. ,K_he investigation reason behind this study was toassess and compare the eﬃcacy of lycopene, LC, ZnSO 4, and CoQ10 against cadmium-induced infertility in male rats.2.Materials and Methods Diethyl ether, phosphate buﬀer solution (PBS), parafor-maldehyde, ethanol, xylene, paraﬃn, hematoxylin, 10% tricyclicacid(TCA),dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoicacid(DTNB), pyrogallol solution, potassium phosphate, hydrogen per-oxide (H 2O2), and cadmium chloride were obtained from SigmaAldrich(Germany).LCandzincsulfate(ZnSO 4)were obtained from Selmore Pharmaceuticals (Pakistan).CoQ10and lycopene were acquired from Bionext Pharmaceuticals,Pakistan.Eosin-Nigrosin stain was obtained from HitechSpecialties Solutions, India.
Centrifuge (800D–4000rpm),microtome, compound microscope (Germany), Eppendorftubes,UV-visiblespectrophotometer(UV-1601,Shimadzu),and computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system(Minitube ®, Germany) were used in the study. 2.1.Experiment Design.Seventy male Wistar rats of 10 weeks old and weighing 150±20g were used in the study.2 InternationalJournalofEndocrinology ,K_he animals were acquired from Riphah Institute of Vet- erinarySciences,Lahore,Pakistan,andthenacclimatizedfortwo weeks in well-ventilated animal house of RIPS, Lahore,Pakistan.,K_he animal study was approved and conductedaccording to the guidelines of the Institutional EthicalCommittee of Riphah International University (Referenceno.REC/RIPS-LHR/2017044).Animals were kept at atemperature of 26 to 30 °C and humidity of 30 to 70%, maintained according to the National Institute of Health(NIH) guidelines.
,K_hese rats were randomly divided intosevengroups,witheachgroupcomprisingoftenanimals.Allanimal groups were separately placed in steel cages. Todemonstrate the curative eﬀect of diﬀerent nutraceuticalsagainstmaleinfertility,theLC,CoQ10,lycopene,andZnSO 4 were orally given to rats for 30 days previously treated withcadmium chloride.Afterwards, the sperm, biochemical,hormonal, and histological parameters were determined.Diﬀerent treatments given to various groups are given inTable 1.Cadmium was administered orally to rats for three times on consecutive days.,K_hen, diﬀerent treatments with nutra-ceuticals were orally administered for 30 days.24h afteradministration of last doses, the rats were anesthetized withdiethyl ether, the blood samples were collected from heartpuncture,andtheirperitonealcavitieswereopenedthroughalow transverse incision to remove the testes of rats from thecontrol and treatment groups immediately.
,K_he blood takeninplaintubeswascentrifuged(3000rpm)at4 °Cfor10minto prepare the serum from each animal and stored it at −20°C until assayed. ,K_he harvested testes specimens were preserved in paraformaldehyde for histological analysis [23].2.2.Epididymis Sperm Count, Viability, and Motility.DeterminationofthemotilitywasdonebytheCASAsystem.,K_hecontralateralepididymiswastransferredtoanotherpetridish containing PBS followed by the diﬀusion method inwhich sperms diﬀused from epididymis tubes.,K_he layers of connective tissue were removed at the juncture between the proximal and distal regions of the cauda epididymis usingJewelers forceps.
Approximately within the 30S, the studysampleswerepickeduptoavoidvariationsthatoccurduringlatesamples.,K_hespermviabilitywasdeterminedbystainingwithEosin-Nigrosin[24].Spermmotilityparameterssuchastotal motility, progressive motility of sperms (PMS), pro-gressive fast motility (PFM), progressive slow motility(PSM), progressive circular motility (PCM), and linearmotility of sperms (LMS) were determined.2.3.MorphologicalStudies.

,K_he absor- bance of the mixture was taken at 325nm. One unit of SODwas described as the amount of enzyme responsible for 50%inhibition of pyrogallol autoxidation per ml of the assaysolution.2.9.CATActivity.,K_heactivityofCATwasassessedbyH 2O2 method.A 50 μl tissue homogenate was added to 1.95ml potassium phosphate solution and (50mM) 1ml of H 2O2.Changeinabsorbanceperminwasdeterminedat240nmto estimate CATactivity [28].2.10.StatisticalAnalysis.,K_heobtainedresultsweretabulated and presented as mean±standard deviation (SD) and evaluatedbyGraphPadPrismsoftwareversion7.01forone- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoctest.Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests showed thesigniﬁcance level of P<0.001, P<0.01, and P<0.05.3.Results Todemonstratethecurativeeﬀectofdiﬀerentnutraceuticalsagainstmaleinfertility,theLC,CoQ10,lycopene,andZnSO 4 were orally given to rats for 30days previously treated withcadmium chloride.
Afterwards, the sperm, biochemical,hormonal, and histological parameters were determined. 3.1.Epididymis Sperm Count.After 30 days of dosing, the sperm count was observed in diﬀerent groups, which in- dicated that the disease control group had shown signiﬁ- cantly reduced sperm count (1.76 ±0.67 million/ml) as compared to the normal control rats (18.55 ±0.95 million/ ml).Treatment with diﬀerent nutraceuticals signiﬁcantlyimproved the sperm count in cadmium-treated rats.,K_hesperm count in lycopene-treated group (18.33 ±0.64 mil- lion/ml)wasthehighestamongalltreatedgroupswhichwasfollowed by ZnSO 4(17.95±0.47 million/ml), LC (16.77±0.74 million/ml), LC-CoQ10 (15.24 ±0.64 million/ ml), and CoQ10 (14.58±0.85 million/ml) treated groups.Moreover, the sperm count in all nutraceutical treated rats resulted in a rise as compared to that of normal control rats except CoQ10 treated rats, which showed statistically re-duced sperm count in comparison to the normal controlgroup.
,K_he eﬀect of nutraceuticals on sperm viability incadmium exposed rats was also signiﬁcant. All nutraceut-icalsincreasedthespermviabilityindiseasedrats.,K_heeﬀectof diﬀerent nutraceuticals on sperm count and viability ofcadmium exposed rats is shown in Figure 1.Results are presented as mean ±SD (n �10).∗∗∗and ## showed statistical signiﬁcance as compared to diseasecontrol and normal control at P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively.3.2.Motility of Sperms.,K_he CASA analysis revealed the motility of sperms in the cadmium-exposed rats.Treatment with nutraceuticals had variable eﬀect on sperm motility parameters such as total motility, PMS, PFM, PSM, PCM,and LMS.,K_he eﬀect of various treatments on cadmium-induced infertility in rats is shown in Figure 2.It was found that the total motile sperms in the disease control group were signiﬁcantly declined (P <0.0001) in comparison to the normal control rats.
Administration oflycopene, LC, and LC-CoQ10 increased the percentage ofmotile sperms in cadmium-treated rats to varying degree.LycopeneandLC-CoQ10hadthemostpronouncedpositiveeﬀect on sperm motility followed by the LC. Administration of cadmium signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of PMS in disease control rats as compared tonormal control rats.It was revealed that the administrationof lycopene, LC, and LC-CoQ10 had a profound positiveeﬀect on PMS in rats preexposed to cadmium.TreatmentwithlycopenehadthemostprominenteﬀectonPMSinratswhileLCandLC-CoQ10hadacomparativeeﬀectonPMSofcadmium-exposed rats.It was found that cadmium exposure in rats signiﬁ- cantly decreased the percentage of PFM sperms as com-pared to normal rats.Administration of CoQ10 and LC- CoQ10 failed to bring about any signiﬁcant increase in PFM in cadmium-exposed rats.However, treatment withlycopene, LC, and ZnSO 4signiﬁcantly improved the per- centage of PFM in rats.
Administration of lycopeneexhibited the most pronounced increase of PFM in cad-mium exposed rats as shown in Figure 2. Cadmium ex-posure also signiﬁcantly decreased PSM in treated rats incontrast to the normal control group.Treatment with LC-CoQ10 exhibited the most signiﬁcant increase in PSM incomparison to the disease control group followed by ly-copene.However, the administration of CoQ10, LC, and ZnSO 4did not cause any increasein the PSMof cadmium- exposed rats, as shown in Figure 2.It was evident that the exposure to cadmium had not brought about any statistically signiﬁcant decline in the percentage of PCM in the disease control group.Admin-istration of ZnSO 4resulted in a signiﬁcant (P<0.001) in- crease in PCM in contrast to disease control.However, thetreatments with lycopene, CoQ10, LC, and LC-CoQ10 hadinsigniﬁcantly aﬀected the PCM induced by cadmium.Furthermore, cadmium exposure did not cause any signif-icant decline in the percentage of LMS in rats.
However, administration of CoQ10 and LC-CoQ10 resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the LMS of cadmium-exposed rats, as shown in Figure 2.

,K_he serum level of testos- terone in normal control group (2.39 ±0.507ng/ml) was higher as compared to cadmium-exposed rats (1.46±0.096ng/ml). All nutraceuticals signiﬁcantly im- proved the level of serum testosterone in cadmium-ex-posed rats.,K_he treatment with lycopene, LC, and LC-CoQ10 resulted in the most pronounced eﬀect on serumtestosterone level in cadmium exposed rats and were sig-niﬁcantlycomparabletoanormalcontrolgroup.However,thetreatmentwithCoQ10andzincsulfateresultedinlowerserum testosterone level as compared to normal controlrats.,K_he eﬀect of diﬀerent nutraceuticals on the serumtestosterone level of cadmium exposed rats is shown in Figure 4.Resultsarepresentedasmean ±SD(n �10).∗∗∗∗and∗∗∗ showed statistical signiﬁcance as compared to the diseased groupat P<0.0001and0.001,respectively,while##showed statistical signiﬁcance to normal control at P<0.01.3.5.
Oxidative Stress Parameters in Rat Testes.Administrationofcadmiumwasfollowedbytreatmentwithdiﬀerent nutraceuticals and then rat testes’ tissue homog-enates (10% w/v) were tested for antioxidant parameters,such as SOD, CAT, and GSH.3.6. SOD Activity.In the current study, the activity of SOD was found to be signiﬁcantly higher in normal control group(26.13±0.78U/mg of protein) as compared to the disease control group (13.29±1.78U/mg of protein).Treatment with LC-CoQ10 (22.28±2.255U/mg of protein) showed the highest SOD activity among all nutraceuticals, which wasstatistically comparable to the normal control group.Treat-ment with lycopene and LC also exhibited statistically higherSOD activity than the disease control group.,K_he activity of SOD exhibited by LC-CoQ10 was insigniﬁcantly diﬀerent from the normal control group, as shown in Figure 5(a).Results are presented as mean±SD (n �10).

Oxidative stress isthe main reason for male infertility along with hormonalimbalance.,K_hecurrentstudyinvestigatedtheeﬀectofCdCl 2 on infertility in male rats and potential eﬀects of lycopene,CoQ10, LC, ZnSO 4, and LC-CoQ10 on CdCl 2-induced in- fertility through assessing semen parameters, measuringtestosterone and testicular antioxidants level such as SOD,CAT, and GSH, as well as evaluating testicular histology. Cadmium is found to cause male infertility through reduction of the weights of testes and epididymis and ac-cumulation in rat testes to exhibit apoptosis, decreased serumtestosterone,andelevatedoxidativestressandcellular glucose uptake [30].In the present study, semen parameterssuch as sperm count and motility were decreased in Wistarrats after exposure to cadmium.
,K_hese ﬁndings are in linewith previous study, which showed that reduction in spermcountisassociatedwithheavymetals,suchascadmium[31].Treatment with lycopene, ZnSO 4, CoQ10, and LC signiﬁ- cantlyraisedsperm count.In addition to spermcount, malefertility is dependent upon the PMS, which is inverselycorelated to DNA fragmentation leading to infertility [32].As the present study demonstrated, the reduction in all sperm motility parameters of the disease control group indicated the DNA fragmentation and male infertility.Administration of lycopene, LC, and LC-CoQ10 increasedPMS in comparison to the disease control rats. Adminis-tration of lycopene has previously shown that it preventedthe DNA damage associated with oxidative stress in vitro inhuman sperms [33].Moreover, LC has also demonstratedcryoprotective eﬀect on human spermatozoa through pre-vention of DNA oxidative, which results in improved invitro fertility [34].
Previous investigations also proved thatlycopene, LC, CoQ10, and Zn had improved sperm count andmotility[12].,K_hetreatmentwithantioxidantsshoweda remarkable improvement in sperm count and viability byreduction in ROS [35].In morphological study, spermatozoa abnormalities, such as vacuolization and oligospermia, were observed incadmium-treated rats. Animals treated with lycopene,CoQ10, LC, and ZnSO 4showed no abnormal spermatozoa in contrast to the disease control group.A previous studyshowed that treatment of cyclophosphamide-induced in- fertile Sprague-Dawley male adult rats with lycopene nor- malized the sperm morphology [36].Previous studiesconﬁrm that the lycopene, LC, CoQ10, and ZnSO 4and CoQ10supplementationsreducedmorphologicalanomaliesin diseased or injured animals [37].,K_hecurrentstudyalsoshowedtheremarkableinhibition in serum testosterone level by cadmium exposure.
,K_hetreatments with lycopene, LC, CoQ10, and ZnSO 4and CoQ10 signiﬁcantly raised the level of testosterone, spermcount, sperm motility, and antioxidant enzyme concentra-tions after acute poisoning of cadmium as compared to control group [35]. Testosterone level is an important factor in the determination of male infertility.A previous studyconducted on LC showed the similar eﬀect on serum tes-tosterone level [20].A study conducted on LC showed asigniﬁcantincreaseinplasmatestosteronelevelinmaleadultalbinomicethatweretreatedwithcadmiumchlorideatdose0.35mg/kg [38].Similarly, a study conducted on ZnSO 4in improving fertility also supported that Zn had a positiveeﬀect on testosterone level and semen quality in infertile 7-week-oldSpragueDawleyrats[39].CoQ10alsoreversedthetesticular damage associated with cadmium toxicity byenhancing the levels of LH and testosterone in rodents likewise the present study [39].
It is found that the reduction in the amount of gluta- thioneandproteincontainingsulfhydrylgroupisassociated withcadmiumexposure,whicheventuallyleadstoincreasedROS production. ,K_his enhanced production of ROS in-creases the lipid peroxidation, excretion of urinary lipidmetabolites, DNAdamage, membrane damage,altered geneexpression,andapoptosis[31].,K_heinvivoantioxidantssuchas SOD, CAT, and GSH were reduced by exposure tocadmium in diseased rats.Treatment with LC, lycopene,ZnSO 4, and LC-CoQ10 raised the activity of SOD in rat testes as compared to the disease control group.Moreover,the CAT activity and GSH content were increased bytreatment with LC and lycopene and LC-CoQ10 in testiclesof cadmium-exposed rats.It is previously found that LCreduced oxidative stress through reduction of malondial-dehyde (MDA) and increasing GSH in lipopolysaccharideexposed rats at 500mg/kg single dose [40].
,K_he in vivoantioxidants(SOD,CAT,andGSH)playapivotalroleinthereduction of oxidative stress and thus decrease the chancesof infertility. In case of histopathological study, diseasecontrol group showed vacuolization in germinal epithelial cells whereas the administration of LC, lycopene, CoQ10, ZnSO 4, and LC-CoQ10 in infertile rats showed no deteri- oration as evident in previous study [41].Previous study on titanium dioxide and benzopyrene- induced toxicity reported that its testicular toxicity wastreated by lycopene through reduction of oxidative stressand suppressing the apoptosis to protect germinal cells[42, 43].

Fur-thermore, lycopene was useful to improve infertility causedby coal burning related ﬂuorosis through oxidative stressassociated with Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracel-lular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway [45].,K_he LC has also shown improvement of oligospermia againstbusulfan-inducedoligospermiathroughreductionofoxidative stress [46].
Moreover, LC-ameliorated trazodoneinduced testicular damage through modulating autophagy,reduction of oxidative stress, and preventing inﬂammation[47]. LC also corrects testicular perfusion to prevent is-chemic injury to testicular tissues [48].Prevention of apo-ptosis is also one of the mechanisms through which LCmight have demonstrated anti-infertility eﬀect againsttoxicants through modulation of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2, BAX, and Caspase-3 [49].
