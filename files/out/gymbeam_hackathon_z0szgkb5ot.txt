Biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status in NHANES: a roundtable summary1–6 Elizabeth A Yetley, Christine M Pfeiffer, Karen W Phinney, Regan L Bailey, Sheena Blackmore, Jay L Bock, Lawrence C Brody, Ralph Carmel, L Randy Curtin, Ramo ´n A Durazo-Arvizu, John H Eckfeldt, Ralph Green, Jesse F Gregory III, Andrew N Hoofnagle, Donald W Jacobsen, Paul F Jacques, David A Lacher, Anne M Molloy, Joseph Massaro, James L Mills,Ebba Nexo, Jeanne I Rader, Jacob Selhub, Christopher Sempos, Barry Shane, Sally Stabler, Patrick Stover, Tsunenobu Tamura, Alison Tedstone, Susan J Thorpe, Paul M Coates, Clifford L Johnson, and Mary Frances Picciano ABSTRACT A roundtable to discuss the measurement of vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) status biomarkers in NHANES took place in July 2010.NHANESstopped measuring vitamin B-12–related biomarkers after 2006.
The roundtable reviewed 3 biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status used in past NHANES—serum vitamin B -12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total homocysteine (tHcy)—and discussed the potential utility of measuring holotranscobalamin (holoTC) for future NHANES. The roundtablefocused on public health considerations and the qualityof the measurement procedures and reference methods and materialsthat past NHANES used or that are available for future NHANES.Roundtable members supported reinstating vitamin B-12 status mea- sures in NHANES.They noted evolving concerns and uncertaintiesregarding whether subclinical (mild, asymptomatic) vitamin B-12 deﬁciency is a public health concern.They identiﬁed the need for ev- idence from clinical trials to address causal relations between subclin-ical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency and adverse health outcomes as well as appropriate cutoffs for interpreting vitamin B-12–related biomarkers.
Theyagreedthatproblemswithsensitivityandspeciﬁcityofindividualbiomarkers underscore the need for including at least one biomarker ofcirculating vitamin B-12 (serum vitamin B-12 or holoTC) and one functional biomarker (MMA or tHcy) in NHANES. The inclusion of both serum vitamin B-12 and plasma MMA, which have beenassociated with cognitive dysfunction and anemia in NHANES and in other population-based studies, was preferable to provide conti- nuity with past NHANES.Reliable measurement procedures are avail-able, and National Institute of Standards and Technology reference materials are available or in development for serum vitamin B-12 and MMA.Am J Clin Nutr 2011;94(suppl):313S–21S.INTRODUCTION The NHANES are a valuable source of data on the nutritional and health status of the US population.
The surveys requirehighly accurate measurement procedures to ensure that their prevalence estimates are comparable with commonly used cutoffs of nutrient adequacy and safety, and that trends in theseestimates over time are attributable to real changes in nutritional status. Currently, NHANES does not measure serum vitamin B-12 or any other vitamin B-12–related biomarkers.However, NHANES II (1976–1980), the second half of NHANES III (1991–1994), and NHANES 1999–2006 measured serum vitamin B-12 concen-trations.Furthermore, NHANES III (1988–1994) and NHANES1999–2004 measured methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations, and NHANES III (1991–1994) and NHANES 1999–2006 mea- sured total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations.
The National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ofﬁce of Dietary Sup- plementsoftheNationalInstitutesofHealthconvenedaroundtable panel on July 15–16, 2010, in Rockville, MD, to review the mea-surement of biomarkers of folate and vitamin B-12 status in NHANES.
In this article, we summarize the roundtable’s dis- cussion, which focused on the following: 1) public health con- siderations for including vitamin B-12–related biomarkers in NHANES and 2) the quality of the vitamin B-12–related mea- surement procedures and reference methods and materials that 1From the Ofﬁce of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (EAY , RLB, CS, PMC, and MFP); the National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA (CMP); the Analytical Chemistry Division, National Institute of Standardsand Technology, Gaithersburg, MD (KWP); the Haematology Department, United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service, Sutton Cold- ﬁeld, United Kingdom (SB); the Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Uni-versity Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY (JLB); Genome Technology Branch,National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (LCB); the Department of Medicine, New York Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY (RC); Weill Medical College, Cornell University,New York, NY (RC); the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD (LRC, DAL, and CLJ); the Department of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL (RAD-A); the Departmentof Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (JHE); the Department of Medical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Medicine, University of California Davis, Sacramento, CA (RG); the FoodScience and Human Nutrition Department, University of Florida, Gainesville,FL (JFG); the Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, W A (ANH); the Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH(DWJ); the Department of Cell Biology, Lerner Research Institute, ClevelandClinic, Cleveland, OH (DWJ); Jean Mayer US Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA (PFJ and JS); the Department of Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine,Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (AMM); Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA (JM); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutesof Health, Bethesda, MD (JLM); the Department of Clinical Biochemistry,Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark (EN); the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, College Park, Am J Clin Nutr 2011;94(suppl):313S–21S.

This article, in comparisontothe folate-relatedbiomarkerssummary(3),includes the roundtable’s discussions of tHcybecausevitamin B-12 status isthe predominant nutrient determinant of high tHcy concentrations among US population groups (5–7). The roundtable also consid- ered holotranscobalamin’s (holoTC’s) possible utility as an in-dicator of vitamin B-12 status for future NHANES (8, 9).The roundtable reviewed vitamin B-12–related public health and measurement quality issues in the context of the NHANESmission and capabilities.The experts did not consider broader research and clinical application issues for these biomarkers or differences in the measurement procedures that research, clinical,and commercial laboratories use.The roundtable identiﬁed anddiscussed the scientiﬁc issues involved in deciding whether to include vitamin B-12–related biomarkers in future NHANES.
Forease of use, we used the more common terminology of “vitamin B-12” in place of the more precise terminology of “cobalamin” (9). When we used serum vitamin B-12 data in this article, weconverted the values to pmol/L (1.0 pg/mL or ng/L = 0.7378 pmol/L).For plasma MMA, we converted the values to nmol/L (1.0 ng/mL or lg/L = 8.468 nmol/L).MONITORING OF VITAMIN B-12 STATUS IN NHANES The roundtable focused on 2 key vitamin B-12–related mon- itoring issues: 1) the public health need for assessing vitamin B-12 status and 2) the usefulness of several biomarkers in con- ducting these assessments.Ralph Carmel outlined key issues for the roundtable to consider (9).Regan Bailey provided data on vitamin B-12 status assessments for adults in NHANES.
Public health need for monitoring of vitamin B-12 status The roundtable considered whether the primary purpose of monitoring the USpopulation’s vitamin B-12statusistodetermine the prevalence of the uncommon and serious clinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency characterized by megaloblastic anemia and/or neuro-cognitive dysfunction; ’94% of these cases arise from pernicious anemia. Alternatively, the primary purpose could be to monitor the more common subclinical (mild, asymptomatic) vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, deﬁned by abnormal concentrations of vitamin B-12–related biomarkers [also referred to as SCCD or subclinical co- balamin deﬁciency (9)].Approximately 1–2% of the elderly US population has clinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, and ’10–20% has subclinical deﬁciency (10).
BecauseNHANESisnotwellsuitedformonitoringraremedical conditions such as pernicious anemia, the roundtable found thequestion posed by Carmel as to whether monitoring the morecommon subclinical deﬁciency has public health merit (9) to be a helpful anchor point for their overall dialogue. The common assumption that detecting subclinical deﬁciency early is importantto enable public health interventions that prevent its progression to clinical deﬁciency lacks conﬁrmatory evidence (9).Subclinical deﬁciency often arises from different causes (eg, malabsorption offood-bound cobalamin or unidentiﬁed causes) than does clinical deﬁciency(eg,absenceofintrinsicfactorduetoperniciousanemia) (9, 10).Moreover, limited evidence suggests that many individualswith subclinical deﬁciency, even without treatment, spontaneously regain normal vitamin B-12 status or experience no further de- terioration after several years, raising questions about the publichealth concerns with subclinical deﬁciency (9–11).
Subclinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency per se may adversely affect cognitive or neurologic function. Results from some, but not all, observational studies show associations between vitaminB-12 deﬁciency and cognitive impairment (12–17).The round- table noted, however, that no clinical trials have conﬁrmed a causal relation between subclinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency andadverse outcomes.Therefore, the roundtable agreed that the public health implications of subclinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency are uncertain, although the observational evidence on adverse effectsis of concern and warrants further evaluation.Biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status The roundtable considered the usefulness of available bio- markers for assessing vitamin B-12 status in NHANES.

Currently available biomarkers can be categorized as those that directly measure the vitamin B-12 in blood and those that measure metabolitesthataccumulatewithinadequateamountsofvitaminB-12(8–10,18).SerumvitaminB-12andholoTCmeasurecirculatingvitaminB-12concentrations.Thesebiomarkersthereforereﬂectthe broad vitamin B-12 status range from high risk of severe deﬁciency to adequacy. MMA and tHcy, which are functional (metabolic)measures of vitamin B-12 status, accumulate when concentrations of vitamin B-12 are inadequate; tHcy also accumulates with in- adequate amounts of folate and, to a lesser degree, riboﬂavin andvitamin B-6.These functional measures are useful for identifying subclinical vitamin B-12 status and reﬂect early changes invitamin B-12 status.Information from both types of biomarkers can yielda more accurateassessment of vitaminB-12statusthan informationfrom only one vitamin B-12 status category (9).
Factors unrelated to vitamin B-12 status affect all 4 biomarkers (8–10, 18–20). Impaired renal function alters MMA and tHcy and,to a lesser extent, holoTC and serum vitamin B-12 concentrations.Other factors, such as individual genetic variation, disease con- ditions, prescription and other drug use, and pregnancy can alsoaffect the biomarkers.Measurement procedure errors and other technological problems produce spuriously high or low biomarker concentrations (9).These factors adversely affect the biomarkers’sensitivity and speciﬁcity and result in false-positive or false-negative classiﬁcations of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency.These classiﬁcation errors are particularly important for sur- veys such as NHANES that cannot conduct the follow-up di-agnostic testing required for vitamin B-12 deﬁciency diagnosis and treatment (9).
For example, high MMA and tHcy concen- trations occur across all serum vitamin B-12 concentrations,although they are most prevalent in people with the lowest vi- tamin B-12 concentrations (9). Clinical data show that ’2.5– 5.2% of patients with diagnosed vitamin B-12 deﬁciency haveserum vitamin B-12 concentrations above a commonly used cut-off for low values (148 pmol/L), and an even higher proportion of persons with abnormal MMA or tHcy concentrations have serum vitamin B-12 concentrations .148 pmol/L (9).Approximately 20% of persons with low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations have neither clinical nor metabolic signs of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency.The roundtable agreed that because of problems with these bio-markers’ sensitivity and speciﬁcity, measuring a circulating bio- marker (vitamin B-12 or holoTC) and a functional biomarker (MMA or tHcy) concurrently is preferable to measuring onlyone biomarker in NHANES.
The roundtable also reviewed the relevance of common cutoffs for the NHANES population. The vitamin B-12 cutoffs that sci- entists and clinicians use generally are consistent with 2 or 3 SDsfrom a reference range’s mean.A cutoff value consistent with 2 SDs is’200 pmol/L, and a value of 148 pmol/L is consistent with 3 SDs (9, 18).A cutoff of 148 pmol/L misses 3–5% of patientswith clinical deﬁciency, whereas ’200 pmol/L identiﬁes all pa- tients but produces more false-positive results.Systematic bias and spurious results affected some measurement procedures usedin the past to derive reference ranges (9).The cutoff used affectsNHANES prevalence estimates.Using cutoffs similar to those used in the published literature, Regan Bailey (personal commu- nication, 2011) found a prevalence (least-squared percentage 6 S E )o f2 .
8 60.2% for serum vitamin B-12 concentrations ,148 pmol/L, 10.5 60.4% for concentrations ,198 pmol/L, and 25.6 6 0.6% at ,258 pmol/L in an NHANES sample of people aged /C2160 y with impaired but controlled renal function. MMA cutoffs also range considerably, from 210 to 480 nmol/L (9).Researchers have based MMA cutoff values on an approxi-mationoftheinﬂectionpointatwhichMMAconcentrationsstartto increase with decreasing serum vitamin B-12 concentrations or on a percentile of a population-based reference range, or on fullycobalamin-replete subjects (12, 18, 21).The cutoff value usedaffects prevalence estimates.In an NHANES sample of adults aged /C2160 y in whom impaired renal function was controlled, Regan Bailey found that a cutoff .376 nmol/L resulted in a prevalence of 2.4%, whereas a cutoff .271 nmol/L produced a prevalence of 5.9% (RL Bailey, personal communication, 2011).
The roundtable discussed the urgent need to base cutoffs for biomarker concentrations on adverse outcome occurrences. The needforsuchcutoffsisparticularlycriticalforsubclinicalvitaminB- 12 deﬁciency, which is the predominant type of vitamin B-12 de-ﬁciency in NHANES populations because it is asymptomatic andresearch has not conﬁrmed a causal relation between subclinical deﬁciency and adverse health outcomes.Validation of cutoff values requires clinical trials and accurate and reliable measurement pro-cedures.Cross-sectional studies, such as NHANES, and other ob- servationalstudiescannotvalidatecutoffs,althoughthesestudiescan help generate hypotheses and examine relations between variables.MEASURES OF VITAMIN B-12–RELATED BIOMARKERS IN NHANES The roundtable reviewed the quality and appropriateness of NHANES procedures to measure vitamin B-12–related biomarkers.
Except for 2 special postsurvey projects at Tufts University that used surplus sera to measure MMA and tHcy in the second phaseof NHANES III (1991–1994) (22, 23), the Division of Laboratory Science at the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measured serumvitamin B-12 and plasma MMA and tHcy in NHANES. Christine Pfeiffer reviewed the NCEH laboratory procedures and results for the roundtable.Measurement of serum vitamin B-12 in NHANES NHANES used the Bio-Rad Quantaphase II radioimmuno- assay (RIA) kit for (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) allserum vitamin B-12 measures except for the 1976–80 survey, which used the Quantaphase I kit ( Table 1 ) (24–28).In 2007, the manufacturer discontinued the Bio-Rad RIA.
The loss of this assaykit and the ﬁnding that serum vitamin B-12 concentrations col- lected from NHANES III (1991–1994) to NHANES 2006 had not changed appreciably (1) resulted in a decision to drop mea-sures of vitamin B-12 status after NHANES 2006. With the Quantaphase II kit, the NCEH obtained long-term CVs (NHANES1999–2004)of3–6%forconcentrationsof ’280–1200 pmol/L (29).Quality-control (QC) pools were stable and re-producible across all surveys.For reference material 81/563 from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC; http://www.nibsc.ac.uk/products/biological_reference_VITAMIN B-12–RELATED BIOMARKERS IN NHANES 315S materials.aspx), the NCEH obtained a mean ( 6SD) value of 234614 pmol ( n= 27) from 1994 to 2006 compared with an NIBSC-certiﬁed concentration of 236 pmol/ampule.Over several years in the College of American Pathologists (http://www.cap.
org/apps/cap.portal) proﬁciency testing program, the NCEH re-sults were ’20% higher than the College of American Patholo- gists all-laboratory trimmed mean; the Bio-Rad RIA had no peer group using this measurement procedure with which to directly compare results. Because the NCEH anticipated that NHANES might consider reinstating vitamin B-12 measures at a later date, it evaluated the Roche Elecsys 170 chemiluminescent measurement procedure(Roche, Basel, Switzerland).The result was 373 pmol/ampule for the NIBSC 03/178 reference material, with an assigned reference value of 354 pmol/ampule.When the NCEH fortiﬁed a serum poolwith this reference material, complete recovery resulted (103%).The NCEH used its Roche E-170 procedure to characterize 3 levels of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardreference material (SRM) 3951 (30), which is under de-velopment.
The NIST will use results from higher-order reference measurement procedures to assign this SRM’s target values. NCEH-measured mean ( 6SD) vitamin B-12 concentrations were 42.665.8 (CV: 13.7%), 114.4 66.0 (CV: 5.3%), and 283.1 6 7.3 pmol/L (CV: 2.6%) ( n= 12) for this reference material.The NCEH obtained within-day CVs ( n= 10) of 0.9–2.1% for its low and high ( ’175 and 825 pmol/L) QC pools.Between-day CVs over 5 mo ( n= 22) were 3.8–6.5% for 5 QC pools with concen- trations of ’200–900 pmol/L.The manufacturer -speciﬁed limit of detection for this serum vitamin B-12 measurement procedure was 22 pmol/L.In a crossover study ( n= 280), the NCEH reanalyzed NHANES samples it had previously measured with the Bio-Rad Quanta-phase II RIA by using the Roche E-170 measurement procedure to determine the procedures’ c omparability.The median was 390 pmol/L for the Bio-Rad and 438 pmol/L for the Roche procedure, andthe Pearson correlation coefﬁcient was 0.98 over a range of ’45– 1100 pmol/L.
A log transformation removed the distribution’s skewness with a Deming regression ﬁt of log vitamin B-12 Roche = 0.97·log vitamin B-12 Bio-Rad + 0.10 pmol/L and showed a small but signiﬁcant constant and proportional bias ( Figure 1 A). The Bland-Altman bias plot showed a mean relative bias of 10.7% forthe Roche procedure compared with the Bio-Rad procedure, with95% limits of agreement from 25.6% to 27% (Figure 1B).Measurement of plasma MMA in NHANES The NCEH used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/ MS) to measure plasma MMA in NHANES ( Table 2 ) (31–34), resulting in long-term CVs (NHANES 1999–2004) of 3–8% forlow QC pools ( ’100–500 nmol/L), 2–4% for medium QC pools (1000–2000 nmol/L), and 2.0–3.5% for high QC pools ( ’10,000 nmol/L).QC pools were stable and reproducible across all sur-veys.
As a participant in the Danish External Quality Assess- ment program since 2000, the NCEH’s MMA results have consistently been within the acceptance interval that the pro-gram calculated from biological variation ( 621% of the pro- gram mean). The NCEH’s results were, on average, 6% lower than the program mean.If NHANES reinstates MMA measures in future surveys, the NCEH could use their GC/MS measurement procedure because the NCEH has maintained proﬁciency in this procedure despite its absence from recent NHANES.However, the NCEH isconsidering using a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedure similar to the one that several labora- tories have recently used (35–37).The roundtable encouraged theNCEH to use LC-MS/MS for future analyses.Measurement of tHcy in NHANES The measurement procedures, QC data, and survey compa- rability of tHcy in NHANES are described elsewhere (38–45) andare summarized in Table 3 .
The NCEH observed long-term (NHANES 1999–2004) CVs of 3–5% for multiple QC pools covering a tHcy concentration range of ’6–27 lmol/L (45). QC pools were stable and reproducible in all surveys.The NCEHAbbott AxSym (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL) results were within 10% of the NIST SRM 1955 certiﬁed values, 9% higher for the low level ( ’4lmol/L), 1% higher for the medium level (’9lmol/L), and 6% lower for the high level ( ’18lmol/L).As a participant in the Danish external quality assurance program in 2000–2008, the NCEH consistently obtained tHcy results withinthe program’s acceptance interval on the basis of biological vari- ation (617% of the program mean).The NCEH’s results were, on average, 0.2% higher than the program mean.Possible measurement of holoTC in NHANES Ebba Nexo (8) described several procedures for assessing holoTC, including a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure on the Abbott AxSym analyzer platform.
This pro-cedure is easier to use than previous ones and can measureholoTC directly without sample pretreatment (46). In a com- parison study in Europe, all available methods gave similar values (47).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement had a 4–5% imprecision rate and a 5–20 pmol/L method-dependent de- tection limit.NIST REFERENCE METHODS AND MATERIALS The roundtable reviewed the quality and appropriateness of the NIST reference methods and materials for use in NHANES to achieve traceability of NHANES measurements to a higher-orderreference method and materials.
Karen Phinney discussed the development of reference methods and materials for vitamin B-12, tHcy, and MMA at the NIST.TABLE 1 Vitamin B-12 biomarker measurement in NHANES1 Survey Measurement procedure Matrix Laboratory Population age 1974–1975 — — — — 1976–1980 Bio-Rad QP I Serum NCEH 6 mo–74 y, subset1988–1991 — — — — 1991–1994 Bio-Rad QP II Serum NCEH /C214y 1999–2000 Bio-Rad QP II Serum NCEH /C213y 2001–2002 Bio-Rad QP II Serum NCEH /C213y 2003–2004 Bio-Rad QP II Serum NCEH /C211y 2005–2006 Bio-Rad QP II Serum NCEH /C211y 2007–2008 — — — —2009–2010 — — — — 1QP, Quantaphase (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA); NCEH, Na- tional Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control andPrevention.316S YETLEY ET AL NIST methods and materials for vitamin B-12 and MMA Currently, the NIST has no SRM with certiﬁed values for vi- tamin B-12 or MMA, although it provides information values forvitamin B-12 using RIA in SRM 1955 (48).
The NIST is de-veloping SRM 3951 (30) for serum vitamin B-12 with target pools of 74 pmol/L (100 pg/mL), 148 pmol/L (200 pg/mL), and 332 pmol/L (450 pg/mL). The 332-pmol/L pool is “normal” serum,whereas the 2 lower pools are a blend of normal and serum stripped of its naturally occurring vitamin B-12.Unique challenges in developing a higher-order vitamin B-12 measurement procedure include the forms of vitamin B-12 to measure.One challenge is whether converting all forms to cy- anocobalamin and measuring this compound to determine totalserum vitamin B-12 best meets user needs.Also, do users need to evaluate the different biologically relevant species?Another challenge is the low concentrations that will be encountered insome individuals with low vitamin B-12 status ( ’100 pmol/L or less) of serum vitamin B-12.
To account for potential analyte losses during sample preparation, a stable-isotope–labeled in-ternal standard should be used, but chemical synthesis of anisotopically labeled form of vitamin B-12 is not currently fea- sible. A labeled form of vitamin B-12 would be the ideal internal standard because it should behave similarly to the unlabeledendogenous form, including binding to the 2 circulating vitamin B-12 binding proteins (haptocorrin and transcobolamin).Alter- native options might be a labeled compound produced by bac-teria or partial chemical synthesis incorporating isotopically labeled precursor compounds.The NIST has not found a good internal standard candidate among other structurally related compounds.On the basis ofpreliminary work using LC-MS/MS, the NIST has identiﬁed some vitamin B-12 species that it could quantify.
Remaining challenges include obtaining the needed sensitivity, developing an appro-priate quantitation mechanism, and obtaining sufﬁcient precision to certify concentration values in the reference materials. The roundtable suggested developing a valid LC-MS/MS method tomeasure total cobalamin after converting all species to cyanoco- balamin.Characterization of vitamin B-12 species is a long-term goal, but a need exists now for an SRM for total cobalamin.The NIST is currently developing MMA reference methods and materials.Phinney reported that GC/MS and LC-MS/MS procedures using derivatized or underivatized compounds workwell.The NIST is developing new reference materials for SRM909 (49) and ﬁnds that these materials are appropriate for SRM use (MMA concentration of ’170 nmol/L).The NIST’s SRM 1950 (50) materials are also appropriate (MMA of ’300 nmol/L).However, SRM 3591 (30), which is under development, is not appropriate (MMA of ’35 nmol/L).
NIST methods and materials for tHcy NIST SRM 1955 has certiﬁed values for mean ( 6expanded uncertainty) tHcy concentrations of 3.98 60.18lmol/L, 8.85 6 0.60 lmol/L, and 17.7 61.1lmol/L (48, 51–53). Level 2 is a naturally occurring serum material, level 1 is diluted, and level 3 isfortiﬁed to achieve target concentrations.In a commutability study with 20 fresh-frozen samples and a limited concentration range, SRM 1955 was commutable across 14 commercial tHcy immuno-and enzymatic assays (54).The Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine database lists the NIST GC-MS and LC-MS/ MS methods as reference measurement procedures (55).ROUNDTABLE DIALOGUE: VITAMIN B-12–RELATED BIOMARKERS IN NHANES The roundtable members were generally satisﬁed with the mea- surement and reference material issues and therefore focused their FIGURE 1.Crossover study ( n= 280) comparing serum vitamin B-12 (B12) results using 2 different measurement procedures.

Reinstatement of vitamin B-12 biomarkers in NHANES Overall, the roundtable experts supported reinstating vitamin B-12–related biomarker measurement in future NHANES anddiscussed possible reasons to justify its inclusion in future NHANES. The roundtable noted that interest in monitoring vi- tamin B-12 status began with folic acid fortiﬁcation of cerealgrains in the United States in 1996, because this fortiﬁcation might mask hematologic symptoms of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, resulting in diagnosis and treatment delays that would promotethe progression of mild vitamin B-12 insufﬁciency to more clin-ically severe deﬁciency.However, before and after fortiﬁcation, median serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (343–356 pmol/L) and the prevalence of serum vitamin B-12 concentrations ,148 pmol/L (2.7–4.8%) did not change appreciably (29).
Only 2% of the US population had high MMA concentrations indicating inadequate vitamin B-12 status ( .370 nmol/L) in NHANES 1999–2000, although prevalence in persons aged /C2160 y was 7% (56). The roundtable noted that the lack of change in serum vitamin B-12concentrationsmaybemisleadingbecauseofthelonglatencyperiod required to develop vitamin B-12 deﬁciency.Alternatively, the assumption that mild vitamin B-12 deﬁciency is very likely to progress to more severe clinical deﬁciency may be erroneous (9).Some roundtable experts noted that the ratio of high folate con-centrations to low vitamin B-12 status generated the most concern about potential adverse effects of folic acid fortiﬁcation.Selhub et al (15) observed anemia and cognitive impairment ’5 times more often in the group with elevated folate status ( .59 nmol/L) in combination with low vitamin B-12 status (serum ,148 pmol/L or MMA .210 nmol/L) than in the group with normal vitamin B-12 and folate status.
The roundtable noted that the evolving observational evidence that suggests an association between subclinical vitamin B-12deﬁciencies and adverse effects is of concern. However, pendingtheavailabilityofclinicaltrialstoconﬁrmacausalrelationbetween mild vitamin B-12 deﬁciency and adverse effects, whether mild vitamin B-12 deﬁciency imposes a public health risk is uncertain.Beginning in 2011, NHANES will include 3 cognitive function measures.Several experts thought that these new data would be useful to explore previously observed associations with the morelimited cognitive function data in past NHANES.However, others questioned the relevance to vitamin B-12 deﬁciency of cognitivefunction tests designed to detect Alzheimer disease or the con- tinued need for more NHANES hypothesis-generating research, given that several observational studies have already identiﬁedassociations between vitamin B-12 status and cognitive function.
AnotherreasontoreinstatevitaminB-12biomarkermeasuresisthe need for population-based prevalence estimates as new data be-come available from clinical trials. NHANES data could also provide useful information on the quantitative relation between intakes and biomarker concentrations, although malabsorptionproblems with some vitamin B-12 insufﬁciencies would compli- cate such analyses.Some experts suggested estimating absorption status by a blood test (eg, intrinsic factor antibody) in people withlow vitamin B-12 status to distinguish patients with perniciousanemiafromthosewithlowvitaminB-12statusduetoothercauses.The roundtable considered population-based changes beyond the aging US population that could affect vitamin B-12 status andwould justify including vitamin B-12 biomarkers in future NHANES.More people use proton pump inhibitors and hista- mine 2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers) that may decreasevitamin B-12 absorption; these are now available over-the-counter (57, 58).

Increased adoption of vegan diets, the substitution of chicken for beef, and decreased use of dairy products could lower vitamin B-12 intakes. Several experts felt that as the use ofvitamin B-12–containing supplements (including some with doses of 1000–2000 lg/d) and fortiﬁed foods increases, monitoring long- term, high vitamin B-12 intakes would be useful to evaluate thesafety of chronic exposures to excessively high intakes in healthy populations.Monitoring vitamin B-12 intakes could help assess whether lifestyle changes are associated with changes in vita-min B-12 status.Which biomarkers should future NHANES include?The roundtable addressed which biomarkers to include in NHANES if the program reinstates vitamin B-12 status moni-toring.Given each biomarker’s sensitivity and speciﬁcity prob- lems, the results of a single biomarker measurement would be difﬁcult to interpret.
But if NHANES can measure only onebiomarker, some experts felt that this measure should reﬂect the broad range of vitamin B-12 status in the US population. Vitamin B-12 and holoTC increase continuously with increasing intakes,at least until vitamin B-12 saturates the transport proteins, and therefore reﬂect a broad range of intakes and status.Other ro- undtable experts felt that the sensitivity of MMA and tHcy toearly inadequacies in vitamin B-12 status and marginal vitamin B-12 intakes could support the use of either one as the sole NHANES biomarker.Mean corpuscular volume to detect meg-aloblastic anemia would not be useful because ,10% of patients with vitamin B-12 deﬁciency have megaloblastic anemia, and high mean corpuscular volume is more likely to reﬂect alcohol abuse than vitamin B-12 deﬁciency (9).
However, the roundtable strongly urged that, given the sen- sitivity and speciﬁcity problems of all vitamin B-12–related biomarkers, future NHANES should concurrently measure atleast one biomarker of circulating concentrations of vitamin B-12 (vitamin B-12 or holoTC) and one biomarker of functional vi- tamin B-12 status (MMA or tHcy). If a choice must be madebetween serum vitamin B-12 and holoTC, holoTC has the ad- vantage of not being affected by “false-positive” low vitamin B-12 concentrations such as those caused by genetically determinedhaptocorrin deﬁciencies.These conditions result in low circu-lating vitamin B-12 concentrations but have no adverse effect on vitamin B-12 status because they do not affect holoTC, which is the universal transport protein for vitamin B-12 uptake in allcells.
However, the roundtable also recognized that holoTC mea- surement is new and would beneﬁt from additional performance studies to engender full conﬁdence in the use of holoTC forpopulation-based surveys. Therefore, at this time, the roundtable agreed that serum vitamin B-12 is preferable over holoTC as the measure of circulating concentrations of vitamin B-12.MMA ispreferable to tHcy if a choice must be made between these bio-markers because it increases with vitamin B-12 inadequacy, but not with folate inadequacy, whereas both of these nutrient deﬁciencies affect tHcy.The roundtable generally agreed that, if NHANES reinstates 2 vitamin B-12–related biomarkers, serum vitamin B-12 and plasma MMA would provide continuity with past surveys andprovide circulating and functional indicators of vitamin B-12 status.These variables have shown associations with anemia and cognitive decline in previous NHANES and in other studies (12–15,59).
Reliable measurement procedures are available, and the NIST is developing reference materials. The roundtable also suggested that NHANES periodically measure vitamin B-12, holoTC, MMA,and tHcy concurrently to provide valuable information on their relations in the general population and on how prevalence estimates vary by biomarker or biomarker combinations.SUMMARY In July 2010, a roundtable reviewed the measurement of vi- tamin B-12 status biomarkers in NHANES.The roundtable wasuncertain whether subclinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency is a public health problem warranting population-based monitoring.How- ever, associations between subclinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciencyand adverse health outcomes in observational studies are of concern and urgently need further evaluation in clinical trials.Clinical trials must use accurate and reliable measurement procedures to de-termine appropriate cutoffs for biomarker concentrations to identifyat-risk populations.
The roundtable was generally satisﬁed with the vitamin B-12 biomarker measurement procedures that past NHANES have used or that are available for use in future NHANES, as wellas the reference methods and materials available from, or under development by, the NIST. The experts supported reinstating vitamin B-12–related biomarkers in future NHANES and sug-gested several public health and environmental reasons for doing so.Finally, the roundtable agreed that future NHANES should include at least 2 biomarkers—1 of circulating vitamin B-12concentrations (preferably vitamin B-12) and 1 metabolic indicator of vitamin B-12 insufﬁciency (preferably MMA).We thank Anne Thurn and Claudia Faigen of the Ofﬁce of Dietary Supple- ments, National Institutes of Health; Kimberly Potter, Megan McNamee, andTherese Gibson of ICF International; and Mike Bykowski of Consolidated Solutions and Innovations for their outstanding logistical, organizational, and follow-up support.
