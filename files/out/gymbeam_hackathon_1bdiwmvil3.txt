Introduction: Vitamin D de ﬁciency (VDD) ( <30ng/ml) is a global epidemic.Vitamin D adequacy (VDA) ( ≥30 ng/ ml) is rarely achieved, despite a rise in the use of vitaminD supplements (VDS).[1] We designed the present studyto assess the effectiveness of a treatment strategy used inour practice.Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of a pa- tient tailored strategy in our Endocrine practice in Patras,Greece for 10 years.Patients with VDD enrolled in a two-step strategy using a loading dose (LD) for 2 months andhalf that dose for maintenance (MD) thereafter, usingcholecalciferol 25.000 IU amps.LD: subjects with 25-D<10 ng/ml: 3 amps weekly; 25-D 10-19.9 ng/ml: 2 amps weekly; 25-D 20-29.9: 1 amp weekly.We retested 25-D after2 months and yearly thereafter.We halved the dose when25-D reached >50 ng/ml and doubled it when 25-D dropped <30 ng/ml.We followed our subjects for up to 5 years.Subjects who did not take VDS, served as controls.
We ex-cluded those who admitted to use <50% of the VDS pre- scribed. All subjects signed informed consent for releaseof their clinical data.Results: A total of n =3,871 subjects were included, with a mean follow up of 1.95 years:n=1,554 cases and n =2,317 controls.In an intention-to- treat analysis, 25-D rose from 20.3 ±6.5 at baseline, to 41.0±10.3 at 2 months (VDA 1461/1554, 94.0%), 39.5 ± 8.8 at 1 year (VDA 792/876, 90.4%), 39.0 ±8.5 at 2 years (n=596, VDA 530/596, 88.9%), 39.5 ±8.8 at 3 years (VDA 375/417, 89.9%), 40.5 ±8.6 at 4 years (VDA 258/280, 92.1%) and 39.4 ±8.0 ng/ml at 5 years (VDA 174/189, 92.1%).Controls had a baseline 25-D of 19.7 ±6.1, at 2 months 20.2 ±7.3 (VDA 209/2317, 9.0%), at 1 year 19.8 ± 5.9 (VDA 146/1643, 8.9%), at 2 years 19.2 ±7.0 (VDA 105/ 1107, 9.5%), at 3 years 20.0 ±6.5 (VDA 98/821, 11.9%), at 4 years 19.9 ±6.3 (n =71/633, 11.2%) and at 5 years 20.2 ±6.1 ng/ml (VDA 50/401, 12.5%).
All time point means were lower in the control group compared to the treatment arm, p <0.001. Overall, 324/3912 (8.3%) time point meas- ures were <30 ng/ml on treatment and no measurements >100 ng/ml were observed; 1 new case and 3 recurrent cases of kidney stones occurred in the treatment arm; 2 new casesand 7 recurrent cases occurred in the control group, p >0.05.Conclusions Despite its simplicity, our treatment strat- egy appears extremely effective in producing vitamin D ad-equacy, as seen in this large, real-world population ofpatients with vitamin D de ﬁciency.Our strategy is one of the most effective one ’s ever reported in day-to-day clinical practice.Similar protocols should be implemented globally,if we are to solve this major health issue.Reference: [1] Paparodis, R.D.; Bantouna, D.; Karvounis, E.; Zoupas, I.;Livadas, S.; Angelopoulos, N.; Imam, S.; Papadimitriou,D.T.; Jaume, J.C.
