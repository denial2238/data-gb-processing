(family-Solanaceae), known as ‘Indian ginseng ’or ‘Ashwagandha ’is acclaimed as an effective adaptogen, immunomodulator, aphrodisiac and sedative.Ashwagandha ghrita is a recognized ghee based Ayurvedic formulation.
Few ancient texts suggest murcchana process for preparation of Ashwagandha ghrita . Objective: The study was undertaken to evaluate probable effects of murcchana process on ghrita preparation with reference to time and storage conditions.Materials and Methods: Ashwagandha ghrita samples were prepared separately using plain ghee (Indian cow's ghee) and murcchana ghee.These formulations were stored separately in different glass bottles at room temperature and 400C/75%RH.Organoleptic characters (colour, odour, taste, texture and touch)and physicochemical parameters (acid value, peroxide value, iodine value, saponi ﬁcation value, unsa- poniﬁable matter, refractive index and speci ﬁc gravity) were determined after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.Plain ghee and prepared ghrita were subjected for antioxidant evaluation by various in vitro methods.Results: Changes were observed in organoleptic characters and physicochemical parameters of plain ghee and Ashwagandha ghrita formulations.
Alterations in these parameters were more pronounced at high temperature and on long storage. Ashwagandha ghrita prepared with murcchana process exhibited better antioxidant potential in all in vitro methods.Conclusion: The murcchana process was found to be bene ﬁcial towards quality of ghrita.Hence, Ash- wagandha ghrita may be prepared along with murcchana herbs and stored in a good quality glass bottle to ensure improved shelf life of ghrita .©2019 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of Institute of Transdisciplinary Health Sciences and Technology and World Ayurveda Foundation.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).1.Introduction ‘Panchgavya ’is a term used in Ayurveda , comprising ﬁve important substances obtained from cow, namely milk, ghee (clari ﬁed butter fat), curd, urine and dung.
Ayurveda describes a good number of formulations containing ‘panchgavya ’components either individually as well as conjointly with other substances of herbal, mineral or animal origin. Several formulations based on each one of these ﬁve components are reported in Ayurvedic texts with medicinal claims [ 1e5].Ghee , widely considered as the Indian name for clari ﬁed butterfat, is usually prepared from cow milk or buffalo milk orcombination thereof.‘Ghrita ’, also known as clari ﬁed butter, is a traditional adjuvant/vehicle described in Ayurveda [6].Charaka used word ‘sahasraveerya ’forghee and ‘yogvahitwa ’forghrita by way of which it enhances the therapeutic ef ﬁcacy and potency of plant ingredients it is processed with [ 3e5,7].Withania somnifera belongs to the family Solanaceae, popularly known as ‘Ashwagandha ’is mentioned as herbal tonic and health food.It has been used in Ayurvedic and indigenous medicine for very long time to treat various kinds of diseases and human ail- ments.
Among the Ayurvedic rasayana herbs (preparation that works as a health tonic to children, a medicine to middle aged persons and rejuvenator to the elderly), Ashwagandha holds an important place. It constitutes alkaloids and steroidal lactones*Corresponding author.E-mail address: shailendra.gurav@nic.in Peer review under responsibility of Transdisciplinary University, Bangalore.Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine journal homepage: http://elsevier.com/locate/jaim https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2019.10.004 0975-9476/ ©2019 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of Institute of Transdisciplinary Health Sciences and Technology and World Ayurveda Foundati on.
This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 11 (2020) 243 e249 namely; withanine, withananine, somnine, somniferine, somni- ferinine, pseudowithanine tropane, pseudo-tropine, choline, ana- ferine, anahydrine and isopelletierine [ 8e11].Ashwagandha is widely claimed to have hepatoprotective [ 12,13], anxiolytic [ 14], antidepressant [ 14,15], nootropic [ 16], antimicrobial [ 17], anti- inﬂammatory [ 18,19], antioxidant [ 20], antistress [ 21], anticonvul- sant [ 22], cardio-protective [ 23], antitumor [ 24e27], antigenotoxic [28], antiparkinsonian [ 29] and immunomodulatory [ 30] proper- ties. Ashwagandha ghrita (AG) is an effective ghrita formulation beneﬁcial for treatment of weakness, gynaecological disorders, general debility and infertility [ 31].InAyurveda ,‘murcchana samskara ’i.e.processing of cow ghee with antioxidant murcchana herbs i.e.
Emblica of ﬁcinalis (Euphor- biaceae) , Cyperus rotundus (Cyperaceae) , Curcuma longa (Zingiber- aceae) , Terminalia chebula (Combretaceae) and Terminalia bellirica (Combretaceae) and Citrus medicus, is pondered as an important intermediate process in ‘ghrit -kalpana ’to enhance the medicinal potency of ghrita and to get rid of bad odour and rancidity [ 32e37]. Despite the signi ﬁcance of murcchana samskara in the processing of ghee , no scienti ﬁc and systematic studies were conducted till date to delineate the advantage of murcchana samskara with reference to storage conditions of ghrita .So, the present work was undertaken to verify some notions about incorporation of murcchana herbs in ghee by selecting A.ghrita as prototype of ghrita .Studies were also aimed towards investigation of ‘effect of murcchana process and storage conditions ’onA.ghrita to ensure its effect on formulations.2.Materials and methods 2.1.
Preparation of AG using plain ghee Authentic samples of cow ghee and cow milk were purchased from Go-vigyan Anusandhan Kendra , Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. Herbal raw material was procured from experts at Shri-Shail Medifarms, Nagpur, identi ﬁed and authenticated at Department of Botany, Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj University, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India (Voucher Specimen No.8961/21 to 8961/27) (Table 1 ).AG was prepared as per procedure described in Ayurved Sarsangraha [32].Brie ﬂy, coarse powder of dried Ashwagandha roots (two parts) was boiled in water (sixteen parts) until four parts of water remained.This concentrate ( kwath )w a s ﬁltered through muslin cloth and kept aside.Then additional Ashwagandha roots (one part) were processed to prepare Ashwagandha kalka (ﬁne paste).Subsequently cow ghee (one part) and cow milk (four parts) were mixed with kwath and kalka and treated on low to moderate ﬁre in a big iron vessel with continuous stirring.
The appearance of ghee as clear, transparent yellowish liquid and devoid of any froth indicated the preparation near to the end point. Evaporation of entire water was con ﬁrmed by burning a small quantity of the paste inﬁre and careful observation for the crackling sound when sub- jected to ﬁre.Further, heating was stopped and the contents were separated before cooling by squeezing and ﬁltering through two-fold muslin cloth.The ﬁltrate i.e.AG was collected in clean auto- claved glass bottle and stored for further process.2.2.Preparation of murcchana ghee (MG) The MG was prepared as per the procedure described in refer- ence texts and published reports [ 32e34].Brie ﬂy, initially stated amount of plain ghee (sixteen parts, 768 g) was melted in a vessel with moderate heating.A mixture of coarsely powdered ﬁve herbs; T.chebula (Combretaceae) fruits, Terminalia belerica (Com- bretaceae) fruits, C.rotundus (Cyperaceae) rhizomes, E.ofﬁcinalis (Euphorbiaceae) fruits and C.
longa (Zingiberaceae) rhizomes, in equal quantities (one part, 48 g) was ground with juice of C. medicus (one part) to form a smooth paste ( kalka ).The kalka was added to the molten ghee along with water (3.072 lit) and boiled on slow ﬁre till complete evaporation of water.It was then strained through muslin cloth and stored in a well closed autoclaved glass bottle.2.3.Preparation of AG using MG During the study, additional sample of AG was also prepared at once using MG instead of plain ghee , following the same procedure and denoted as AGM i.e.A.ghrita processed with murcchana ghee [32].Here also iron vessel was used during preparation.It was worthy to prepare separate formulations so the effects of murc- chana herbs on composition of ghee during storage at different temperatures could also be estimated.2.4.Evaluation of plain ghee, AG, MG and AGM The ghrita preparations were denoted as MG, AG and AGM for murcchana ghee, A.ghrita prepared with plain ghee ,A.
ghrita pre- pared with murcchana ghee respectively. The use of two different ghee samples i.e.plain ghee and murcchana ghee for preparation of AG allowed comparative assessment between AG and AGM.The samples were examined for various organoleptic properties, physicochemical parameters and antioxidant activity and then stored separately in well closed glass containers at room temper- ature (RT) and 40/C14C/75%RH in humidity chamber (Newtronic, NEC 212 ET).Subsequently physicochemical and organoleptic evalua- tion of all samples was done after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of storage.All studies were performed in triplicate and mean values were recorded.2.4.1.Organoleptic evaluation Sensory (organoleptic) characters play an important role to- wards suitability of ghee containing formulations and are indicative of formulations rancidity [ 38].These characters comprise of color, odour, taste, texture and touch.
The plain ghee and ghritas were allowed to reach normal temperature for proper crystallization before testing. Initial speci ﬁc observations and further changes in sensory characters after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of storage were noted carefully.Table 1 Herbal composition of Ashwagandha ghrita .Name Family Common name Voucher Specimen No.Part of plant Withania somnifera (L.)

Physicochemical evaluation The plain ghee , MG, AG, and AGM samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters like acid value, peroxide value, iodine value, saponi ﬁcation value, unsaponi ﬁable matter, refractive index (RI) and speci ﬁc gravity as per standard procedures described in reference books [ 39,40]. 2.4.3.Anti-oxidant evaluation Antioxidant activity of freshly prepared plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM was evaluated using various in-vitro methods [ 41e43].The antioxidant potential was expressed as IC 50, which denoted the concentration of test samples that inhibited the formation of free radicals by 50%.Ascorbic acid was used as reference standard in all methods.2.4.3.1.DPPH radical scavenging assay.The radical-scavenging or hydrogen-donating ability of plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM was measured using the established 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) method [ 41].
Brie ﬂy, 3.0 mL of 10 e100mg.mL/C01ofghee / ghrita solutions and 1.0 mL of 0.1 mM solution of DPPH in ethanol were mixed together and after 30 min the absorbance wasmeasured at 517 nm. Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture speci ﬁes higher free radical-scavenging activity.2.4.3.2.Nitric oxide radical scavenging assay.Nitrite detection method i.e.Greiss reaction to measure NO generated from sodium nitroprusside was used to assess radical scavenging activity of test samples [ 41,42].Brie ﬂy, 3.0 mL of ghee /ghrita solutions at the concentration of 10 e100 mgm L/C01were mixed with sodium nitro- prusside (5 mM) in phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to incubate at 25/C14C for 150 min.Further these samples were reacted with Greiss reagent (1% sulphanilamide, 2% phosphoric acid, and 0.1% napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride).The chromophore formed during the diazocoupling of nitrite with sulphanilamide and napthylethylenediamine was subjected for absorbance mea- surement at 546 nm.
The reaction mixture (without test sample) with equivalent quantity of distilled water served as control. 2.4.3.3.Hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay.The plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM were subjected for Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) scav- enging assay based on replacement titration [ 41,43].Brie ﬂy, 1.0 mL of 0.1 mM H 2O2, 1.0 mL of 10 e100mg.mL/C01ofghee /ghrita solutions, 2 drops of 3% ammonium molybdate, 10 mL of 2 M H 2SO4, and 7.0 mL of 1.8 M KI were mixed together and the resultant solution was titrated with 5.09 mM Na 2S2O3till complete disappearance of yellow color.Hydrogen peroxide scavenging potential was calcu- lated as % Inhibition ¼(V0/C0V1)/V0/C2100 where, V 0was volume of sodium thiosulphate solution used to titrate the control sample in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (without ghee /ghrita ) and V 1was the volume of sodium thio- sulphate solution used in the presence of the ghee /ghrita .3.Results3.1.
Organoleptic evaluation The plain ghee and ghrita preparations exhibited some speci ﬁc peculiarities. The sensory characteristics were noted as soon as formulations were made.The taste and odour (aroma) were best observed when sample was warm and melted.Sensory characters of these samples of plain ghee and ghrita preparations were care- fully observed initially ( ﬁrst day of preparation) and after 3, 6, 9 and12 months of storage.During the course of study, it was observed that organoleptic characters demonstrated by plain ghee vary with that of ghrita formulations.3.1.1.Color It was observed that during storage of ghee , color got fade.Golden yellow color of plain ghee was changed to pale yellow after storage for 12 months at higher temperature whereas MG showed same color throughout investigation at both temperatures.The AG samples exhibited yellowish color while AGM appeared slightly brownish.
On storage, color of ghee and ghritas showed changes which were mainly established after 6 e9 months. 3.1.2.Odour and taste Aromatic, pleasant and characteristic odour and taste of plain ghee and AG were gradually changed to slightly fragrant and bitter taste on storage at high temperature for 12 months duration.The MG and AGM revealed nearly identical odour (characteristic, aro- matic and pleasant) and slightly astringent taste throughout study and at all storage conditions.3.1.3.Touch and texture Ghritas showed formation of small granules and loose layers when stored at room temperature.These layers and granule ar- rangements were hindered at high temperature.The observations revealed that the smooth, soft touch and texture of ghee , MG, AG and AGM samples were nearly unaffected during the study.3.2.Physicochemical evaluation Ghee undergoes physico-chemical changes, dependent primar- ily on the temperature of storage [ 44,45].
Thus, it was thought worthwhile to study different physicochemical parameters of ghee and prepared ghritas which re ﬂect corresponding changes in ‘ghee ’ composition and are summarized in Table 2 . 3.2.1.Acid value Initially, acid values of AG and AGM were found to be more as compared to plain ghee and MG.All samples showed rise in acid value on storage.Samples of AG and AGM showed slow and gradual rise in acid values during period of storage.The rate of increase in acid value in sample containing murcchana herbs was slower.The AGM samples stored at both temperatures were found to be pro- tected to some extent as indicated by acid values.3.2.2.Peroxide value In case of plain ghee , AG, MG and AGM, peroxide value showed gradual increase during storage at both temperatures.Results clearly revealed that plain ghee showed steady and maximum oxidative damage (1.581 e5.982), mainly at high temperature and after twelve months storage.
MG and AGM also showed rise in peroxide value at high temperature during storage period. 3.2.3.Iodine value Iodine value of plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM samples showed gradual decrease on storage.Changes in iodine value were strik- ingly different at various temperatures.It was observed that initially iodine value dropped slowly but declined signi ﬁcantly at higher temperature, mainly with samples stored for 9 e12 months duration.The AG showed large fall in iodine value (42.10 e32.34) as compared to AGM (45.71 To 38.34) on storage for 12 months duration at 40/C14C/75%RH.N.S.Gurav et al./ Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 11 (2020) 243 e249 245 3.2.4.Saponi ﬁcation value The results indicate the changes in saponi ﬁcation value of ghee and ghrita formulations during storage.In case of plain ghee , saponi ﬁcation value was decreased up to nine months but then surprisingly it showed upward shift in some samples.
In AG and MG samples stored in glass container, saponi ﬁcation value got decreased at all temperatures throughout the period of study. As shown in Table 2 , AGM stored at both temperatures initially showed increase in saponi ﬁcation value after three months i.e.198.8 to 199.6, followed by gradual decline on further storage for long duration.3.2.5.Unsaponi ﬁable matter This parameter was evaluated after determination of saponi ﬁ- cation value which indicates quantity of residual unsaponi ﬁed matter.It is clearly observed that changes in unsaponi ﬁable matter of samples stored at both temperatures throughout study were insigni ﬁcant.3.2.6.Refractive index During the present study it was observed that the RI of plain ghee was lower i.e.1.4448 than MG, AG and AGM.AG sample exhibited sharp rise in RI (1.4550 e1.4565) at high temperature for 12 months storage whereas MG and AGM showed slight changes in RI after nine months storage.3.2.7.Speci ﬁc gravity Allghrita samples i.e.
MG, AG and AGM showed gradual increase in speci ﬁc gravity with time at both temperatures. Comparatively plain ghee showed less increase in speci ﬁc gravity after three months to 12 months at 40/C14C i.e.0.925 to 0.953.In case of AGM, sample kept at 40/C14C showed sudden rise in speci ﬁc gravity i.e.0.952 to 1.471 after twelve months storage.3.3.Antioxidant evaluation In case of in-vitro antioxidant evaluation, all test samples i.e.plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM exhibited concentration dependent (10e100mgm L/C01) free radical scavenging activity.The IC 50of AGM by the DPPH method was found to be 22.97 mgm L/C01, whereas plain ghee , MG and AG showed IC 50values as 40.76, 26.42 and 33.23 mgm L/C01, respectively.In NO method, IC 50for AGM was found to be 24.56 mgm L/C01, whereas plain ghee , MG and AG showed IC 50 value as 41.43, 28.22 and 35.12 mgm L/C01respectively.
Plain ghee ,MG, AG and AGM demonstrated dose dependent H 2O2scavenging activity with the IC 5043.13, 31.03, 38.76 and 25.98 mg/ml respec- tively ( Table 3 ). Ascorbic acid revealed excellent antioxidant ac- tivity in all in-vitro methods.4.Discussion Multicomponent formulations are a common practice in Ayur- veda .Generally, many ingredients in different forms are processed together/separately to get maximum collaborative therapeutic ef- fect (sometimes additive effects) or to minimize side effects or to make it more acceptable by patient.For instance, AG contains Ashwagandha roots processed with cow ghee .In some Ayurvedic scripts it is mentioned that before making any ghrita ,ghee should be processed with ‘murcchana kriya ’, with the use of some herbs to supress, if any rancid (bad) smell present in ghee [32].This renders the ghee clear, devoid of any bad effects and smell and prevents ghee from spoilage [ 33].In present study, AG was selected as a prototype.
In Ayurved Sarsangraha , MG is mentioned for AG preparation [ 32]. Some other reference texts lack mention of speci ﬁc process i.e.‘murcchana process ’to be carried out during preparation of AG.Therefore, this study was an attempt to unlock the ambiguity regarding use of murcchana herbs during preparation of AG.4.1.Organoleptic evaluation Sensory evaluation is a scienti ﬁc discipline used to measure, analyse and interpret reactions to organoleptic characteristics of foods and materials perceived by the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing [ 46].Timely discussions with Ayurvedic experts revealed that some sensory properties of ghee and ghrita formula- tions manifest themselves optimally at different temperatures.Temperature of storage of fat ( ghee ) is an important factor to- wards sensory acceptability and oxidative deterioration.The cow ghee contains carotenoids which are responsible for its distinctive golden yellow color [ 47,48].
Color of ghee /ghrita is also dependent on processing, duration of heating and temperature, nature of herbal ingredients, possible degradation of carotenoids and other fat-soluble pigments present in ghee etc. [ 48,49].Addition of murcchana herbs to yellowish AG must be responsible for brownish color of AGM.The characteristic ﬂavour of ‘ghee ’is because of a complex mixture of compounds produced during the various stages ofTable 2 Physicochemical evaluation of Plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM after 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at RT and 40/C14C temperature.

Physicochemical evaluation Acid value is a measure of the amount of carboxylic acid groups in fatty acid compounds. As oil/fat rancify, over a period of time, triglycerides get converted into fatty acids and glycerol, causing an increase in amount of acids.It can be considered as catalytic effect of iron (from manufacturing vessel) or presence of acidic phyto- constituents or generation of free fatty acids from triglycerides present in ghee or all these may be responsible for higher acid values of ghrita preparations as compared to plain ghee [52].Lipid peroxidation depends on fatty acid composition and storage conditions of fat or oil [ 53].Extent of lipid peroxidation i.e.auto-oxidation is measured in terms of peroxide value, giving initial evidence of rancidity in unsaturated fats and oils.Free unsaturated acids are oxidized more easily and quickly than the same acids in intact glycerides and thus high acidity signi ﬁes high peroxide value [54].
It can be assumed that catalytic action of iron and/or high temperature must be responsible for maximum oxidative deterio- ration of ghee [52,55]. The murcchana herbs seemed to be offering some protection against this catalytic and oxidative damage or peroxide formation at room temperature only.Iodine value indicates quantity of iodine absorbed at unsatura- tion which expresses amount of unsaturation in a fat.Large fall in iodine value of AG as compared to AGM can be corroborated with more oxidation due to high unsaturation in AG whereas in AGM murcchana herbs might have shown their protective antioxidant effect.Saponi ﬁcation value is an index of mean molecular weight (or chain length) of all the fatty acids present and is directly propor- tional to the fatty matter content.It indicates the number of reac- tive terminal acid groups in the fat.
More the fatty matter content ormore the carboxylic functional group per unit mass, there will be more chances of rancidity factor and less will be the shelf life and therapeutic value [ 55e58]. In present investigation, changes in saponi ﬁcation value failed to reveal any signi ﬁcant inference and these variations could be attributable to interactions between different ghee components and phytoconstituents.The unsaponi ﬁable matter consists of substances (lipids of natural origin such as sterols, pigments, vitamins, higher aliphatic alcohols and hydrocarbons as well as any non-volatile foreign organic matter) present in oils or fats which are not saponi ﬁable by alkali hydroxides.Possible interactions between phytoconstituentsand ghee components might have resulted in insigni ﬁcant changes in unsaponi ﬁable matter of samples stored at both temperatures throughout study.
Refractive index, the ratio of the velocity of light in vacuum to its velocity in the substance, is a fundamental physical property of a substance. The RI is often used to ascertain a particular substance, check its purity, or measure its concentration.If RI is more, there will be more concentration of light which facilitates rancidi ﬁcation ofghrita i.e.decomposition of ghrita [55e58].Slight changes in RI of AGM and MG showed reduction in rancidity indicating the anti- oxidant effect of murcchana herbs.Speci ﬁc gravity of ghrita is an indication of the solid to liquid ratio in ghrita .In case of liquid and semi-solid preparations, ongoing chemical processes change their consistency and are responsible for conversion of liquid contents into solid or vice-versa [55].Sudden rise in speci ﬁc gravity of AGM after twelve months storage could be due to the solid extractives originated from the added herbs during the formulation process.
Increase in speci ﬁc gravity revealed increase in solid contents compared to liquidcontents with respect to all ghrita formulations. Less proportion of liquid contents in preparation increases life span of formulations [55e58].Antioxidant potential of test samples by all in-vitro methods was found in increasing order i.e.plain ghee<AG<MG<AGM.Various tannin-rich herbs used in preparation of MG might be responsible for potent antioxidant activity.There could be synergistic effect of antioxidant herbs from MG and Ashwagandha , which resulted in highest antioxidant potential of AGM.From the physicochemical evaluation of plain ghee and all ghrita samples, it can be interpreted that plain ghee and AG had under- gone certain major physicochemical changes during storage as compared to MG and AGM ( Table 2 ).It can be assumed that oxidation is the main reason towards alterations in physicochem- ical properties and ultimately rancidity of ghee -based formulations.Murcchana herbs i.e.T.
chebula ,T. belerica ,C.rotundus ,E.ofﬁcinalis and C.longa are sources of polyphenolic compounds comprising phenolic acids (gallic acid, ellagic acid, chebulinic acid), ﬂavonoids, coumarins, tannins with proven free radical scavenging potential [59e63].These antioxidant principles of murcchana herbs must have contributed towards protection against oxidative damage and hence AGM performed better as compared to all other ghrita preparations.Our ﬁndings con ﬁrm the earlier reports of signi ﬁ- cance of ‘murcchana samskara ’ofghrita for minimizing rancidity and increasing stability.5.Conclusion In a nutshell, the observations and results suggest that, murc- chana process is prerequisite for preparation of A.ghrita to ensure its maximum acceptability, stability and better shelf life.However, it is also established that murcchana herbs are not much effective against oxidative damage occurred at high temperature.Table 3 In-vitro antioxidant evaluation of Plain ghee , MG, AG and AGM.
