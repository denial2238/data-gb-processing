The primary outcome was physical performance. In thisarticle we analyzed the secondary outcomes serum vitamin B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations, assessed at baseline,12 wk, and 24 wk.Also, bone turnover markers and PTH concentrations were studied.Linear mixed models evaluatedgroup differences over time.Results: A significant time ×group interaction ( P<0.001) was found for serum vitamin B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations and the bone turnover markers, but not for serum PTH concentrations ( P=0.09).The intervention increased mean ±SD vitamin B-12 concentrations from baseline (345 ±119 pmol/L) to 24 wk (484 ±136 pmol/L), whereas concentrations remained stable within the control.For 25(OH)D concentrations, the intervention group had agreaterincreasefrombaseline(54.7 ±14.2nmol/L)to24wk(80.1 ±19.2nmol/L)thanthecontrol(60.6 ±15.2compared with 65.6 ±14.6 nmol/L).
The ratio of the net effect of bone formation and resorption was greater in the intervention group, suggesting less bone remodeling, irrespective of sex.Conclusions: A fortified milk supplement and exercise intervention successfully improved vitamin B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations as well as the balance of bone turnover markers of Chinese middle-aged and older adults.

The onset or progress of aging- related pathologies may be delayed with nutrition and physical activity. For optimal bone health, it is recommended to have a sufficient intake of calcium, vitamin D, and protein ( 6,7).Copyright C⃝The Author(s) on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2020.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ ), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com Manuscript received February 25, 2020.Initial review completed April 9, 2020.Revision accepted May 4, 2020.First published online June 26, 2020; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa149.
2112 However, the typical Chinese diet is low in calcium and due to the cultural habit of avoiding direct exposure to sunlight, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among Chinese older adults ( ≥65 y) (8,9). Furthermore, older adults have a greater need for protein than younger healthy adults ( 10).An inadequate intake of these key bone nutrients can increase the risk of falls and fractures and the prevalence of osteoporosis(7,10,11).Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a common problem worldwide and its prevalence tends to increase with age ( 12).However, data are missing on the vitamin B-12 status in middle-aged and older adults living in Hong Kong.Deficiency is often caused by inadequate dietary intake and/or malabsorption of vitamin B-12 ( 12,13).Dietary sources of vitamin B-12 are mostly animal-related such as milk.
However, the ongoingcohort survey “China Health and Nutrition Survey” reported that milk intake was low in Chinese people aged 60 y and older (14).This might lead to a low vitamin B-12 status,which in turn has been associated with a low bone mineral density (BMD), increased bone turnover, and increased fracture risk (15, 16). Multiple trials have investigated the effect of nutritional supplementation on nutritional status and bone health, but these are mainly in Western populations.The Asian dietarypattern is different from Western diets, which may require other nutritional strategies.A limited number of studies in Chinese women have shown that milk supplementation for24 mo increased calcium intake and led to less bone loss (17–19).In addition, men should not be overlooked.Because although BMD decreases at a faster rate in postmenopausalwomen than in men, the latter group tend to have a higher mortality risk after a fracture ( 20,21).
Besides nutrition, exerciseisbeneficialforbonehealthandastrongereffectmaybeexpected from a combined nutrition and exercise intervention (22,23). A survey conducted in 2014 showed low physical activity levels among the adult population of Hong Kong ( 24).Therefore, addressing physical activity levels is of interest.To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first study targeting both Asian male and female middle-aged and olderadults with a combined nutritional and exercise intervention to improve nutritional status and bone health.This study is part of a large trial investigating the health impact of a nutrition and exercise program in Chi- nese adults.
The aim of the present study was to assess whether a 24-wk multidomain lifestyle intervention including a fortified milk supplement and an exercise program had an effect on serum vitamin B-12 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] concentrations and markers of bone turnover in apparently healthy community-dwelling Chinese middle-aged and older adults, compared with a control group withoutintervention.

Exclusion criteria included recent (i.e., past 3 mo) or concurrentparticipation in any lifestyle intervention program, BMI ≥27.5 kg/m 2, self-reported allergy or intolerance to ingredients of the fortifiedmilk supplement, poorly controlled or unstable chronic obstructivepulmonary disease/cardiovascular disease/hypertension,recent illnessesor fractures,undergoing treatment of cancer,and regular use of calciumor vitamin D supplements and traditional Chinese medicines.
Eligibleparticipants were randomly assigned, stratified by sex and age (50–64 compared with ≥65 y), to the intervention or control group. Further details concerning participant recruitment, study design, andmethods have been described elsewhere ( 25).The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese Universityof Hong Kong (reference no.2016.532) and registered at the DutchTrial Registry (NTR6214).All participants provided written informedconsent.T reatment The intervention consisted of a nutrition and an exercise component,both lasting for 24 wk.
Participants in the intervention group hadto drink 2 glasses of a fortified milk supplement (i.e., 2 sachets of30 g each of unbranded OPTIMEL 60 +Diamond powder produced by FrieslandCampina, Netherlands; commercially available) dailyproviding 13.6 g protein, 1008 mg Ca, 30 μg cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3),2.9μg vitamin B-12,and 212 kcal ( Supplemental Table 1 provides a complete overview of the nutritional composition). Cholecalciferolwasprovidedat300%and200%oftheChineserecommendednutrientintake (RNI) for persons aged 50–64 and ≥65 y, respectively; this was still below the tolerable upper limit ( 26).Vitamin B-12 was provided at 121%oftheChineseRNI( 26).Participantsalsoreceivedabriefhealthy lifestyle kit which highlighted the importance of a balanced diet anddaily physical activity.The exercise program consisted of 2 exercise sessions of 1 h each week, conducted in groups of 8–12 participants, for a total of 48 sessions.
The exercise sessions consisted of a warm-up (5–10 min), resistance and balance training (20–30 min), an aerobic component(20 min), and a cool-down (5–10 min). Participants were asked toperform against 60%–80% of their estimated 1-repetition maximumload and resistance was progressively increased based on their RatingofPerceivedExertion(RPE)aftereachweekoftraining.Fortheaerobiccomponent, the aim was a minimum RPE of 13–15 at the beginningand to gradually proceed to an RPE of 15–18 during the later aerobicsessions.The exercises were designed to include variations and wereconducted under the supervision of an exercise instructor.Participants in the control group were asked to maintain their usual physical activities and dietary habits during the study period and weresubjected to the same measurements as the intervention group.Compliance Participants were asked to return any unconsumed sachets of thefortified milk supplement every 2 wk.
Subsequently, compliance tothe nutritional intervention was assessed by dividing the number ofsachets of fortified milk supplement consumed by the number ofsachets provided.Compliance to the exercise intervention was assessedby dividing the completed exercise sessions by the total number ofprescribed sessions. Assessments The primary outcome of the trial was physical performance, whichwas reported in another article ( 25).In this study we analyzed the secondary outcome of nutritional status including serum vitamin B-12and 25(OH)D concentrations,and the tertiary outcomes of serum boneturnover markers and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations.For this, blood samples were collected in the morning (from 09:00 Milk+exercise for B-12, 25(OH)D, and bone turnover 2113 to 11:30) after fasting for ≥12 h and after 15-min rest at baseline, 12 wk, and 24 wk.
Blood was collected in vacutainers with no addedanticoagulant and was kept at room temperature for ∼1 h in order to clot.Hereafter,serum was separated by centrifugation (at 2450 ×gfor 10–15 min at ambient temperature) and stored at −80 ◦C, according to the instructions of Pathlab Medical Laboratories Ltd and Quest.ThelaboratorywasaccreditedbytheCollegeofAmericanPathologists.Testing standards were based on the requirements of ISO 15189:2012andincludedinspectionofpolicies,procedures,records,internalqualitycontrol, and external quality assurance programs. Serum vitamin B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations Serum vitamin B-12 was measured using chemiluminescent immunoas-say (IMMULITE 2000; Siemens Healthineers Global).Intra-assay andinterassay CVs were 6.7%–7.0% and 6.0%–7.9%, respectively.Acutoff value of <150 pmol/L was used for vitamin B-12 deficiency (13,27).Serum 25(OH)D was measured using LC–tandem MS (Quest Diagnostics).
This assay measures both 25-hydroxycholecalciferol[25(OH)D 3] and 25-hydroxyergocalciferol [25(OH)D 2]; total 25(OH)D concentrations were used for the results in the current study. Intra-assay and interassay CVs were between 3.7% and 6.9%.Cutoff values for serum 25(OH)D are <25 nmol/L for deficiency, ≥25 to <50 nmol/L for insufficiency, and ≥50 nmol/L for sufficiency (28,29).Bone turnover markers Serum N-amino terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP) (marker of bone formation) was measured using immunoassay (QuestDiagnostics).Intra-assay and interassay CVs were <10%.Serum C- terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) ( β-isomerized; marker of bone resorption) was measured using electrochemiluminescence assay(Quest Diagnostics).Intra-assay and interassay CVs were 1.7%–2.2%and 3.1%–5.7%, respectively.
PTH Serum concentration of intact PTH was measured using chemilumines-cent immunoassay (IMMULITE 2000; Siemens Healthineers Global).Intra-assay and interassay CVs were 4.2%–5.7% and 6.3%–8.8%,respectively. Dietary intake All participants were asked to fill in a 3-d dietary record including bothweekdays and weekend days at baseline and after 24 wk, which waschecked by trained staff for completeness.Data were processed by theFood Processor Nutrition Analysis and Fitness software version 8.0(ESHAResearch),withtheadditionofcompositionoflocalfoodsbasedon food composition tables from China and Hong Kong.Protein intake(g/d), calcium intake (mg/d), and vitamin D intake ( μg/d) are reported in this article, because these are key nutrients for optimal bone health.Vitamin B-12 intake ( μg/d) is reported as well.More elaborate results on dietary changes will be described separately in another article.
Other measurements Demographic, lifestyle, and medical history data were collectedusing standardized questionnaires. Physical activity was assessed witha validated Chinese version of the International Physical ActivityQuestionnaire (IPAQ-C) ( 30).Anthropometric measurements were done using standardized methods.These additional measurements aredescribed elsewhere ( 25).Statistical analysis The trial was powered based on the outcome of gait speed [primary outcome, described in another article ( 25)] and the secondary outcome of serum 25(OH)D.Based on a previous trial investigating the effectof milk supplementation on bone turnover markers and vitamin Dstatus in healthy Chinese adults ( 28), a minimum sample size of 114 (57/group)wasneededtodetectameandifferenceof8nmol/Linserum25(OH)D between the control and intervention groups with an SD of15 nmol/L, 80% power, and a 5% significance level.
Accounting for a noncompliance rate of 20% and a dropout rate of 20%, a final samplesize of 180 (90/group) participants was chosen. Datawereanalyzedusingtheintention-to-treatmethod.Continuous variables are presented as mean ±SD for normally distributed data and as median [IQR] for nonnormally distributed data.Categoricalvariablesarepresentedasnumberofsubjects(percentage).Independentttest, chi-square test, or Mann–Whitney Utest was used to compare values at baseline between groups.All data were checked for normality.In case of a nonnormal distribution, nonparametric tests or logtransformations were applied.Extreme outliers in primary dependentvariables were retained in final analyses when results including and excluding the outlier were similar.
Differences in serum vitamin concentrations and bone markers between groups over time were analyzed using linear mixed modelswith subject as a random factor and time (baseline,12 wk,and 24 wk),group (control and intervention), and time ×group as fixed factors. To determine differences in vitamin B-12 deficiency and vitamin Dinsufficiency between the 2 groups at each time point, a chi-square testwas used.Within-group differences compared with baseline were testedby McNemar’s test.Inadditiontothecrudeconcentrationsoftheboneturnovermarkers PINP and CTX, an uncoupling ratio was calculated as the ratio ofpercentage change from baseline ( 31): Uncouplingratio =endP1NP −baselineP1NP baselineP1NP/endCTX −baselineCTX baselineCTX(1) Aratio <1indicatesnetresorption,whereasaratio >1indicatesnet formation ( 31).A Mann–Whitney Utest was used to investigate if the ratio was different between groups.
Analyses of bone markers were not adjusted for potential con- founders including age, sex, BMI, body weight, energy intake, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, comorbidities, and fracture history ( 32), because these variables did not significantly differ at baseline and overtime between the groups. For the analysis of serum 25(OH)D, seasonin which the baseline measurement was performed was added as aconfounder to the model.Season was categorized as spring (March toMay) and summer (June and July).The aforementioned analyses forserum vitamin concentrations and bone markers were also performedseparately for men and women.These sex-specific results should beinterpreted with caution, because the power of the study might beinadequate to detect a difference.Changesindietaryintakeovertimeandwithingroupswereassessed with Wilcoxon’s Signed Rank test.All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0 (IBM Corp.).
A 2-sided Pvalue of 0.05 was used for statistical significance. Results Participants In total, 180 people were randomly assigned to either thecontrol or the intervention group.At the end of the study, the control group consisted of 83 participants and the intervention groupof80.Supplemental Figure 1 presentstheflowchartofthe numbers of participants at different study stages.The dropout rate was low in both groups (intervention: 8%; control: 11%).Furthermore, the intervention group showed a moderate tohigh compliance to the proposed intervention (80% achieved ≥80% of supplement compliance and 73% attended ≥80% of the exercise program).There were no significant differencesin baseline characteristics between participants who were not willing to receive the group allocation, lost to follow-up, or discontinued the study and those who remained in the data 2114 Groenendijk et al.

The prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency ( <150 pmol/L) was low and similar in both groups over time ( Table 3). A significant time ×group interaction was found for serum 25(OH)D concentrations as well ( P<0.001; adjusted for season), independent of sex.The 25(OH)D concentrations increased in both groups, with a greater increase in the intervention group ( Table 2, Supplemental Figure 2B).Themean 25(OH)D concentration was sufficient at baseline in both groups.No vitamin D deficiency ( <25 nmol/L) was seen in the study population over time.Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency ( ≥25 to <50 nmol/L) decreased by 30% from baseline to 24 wk in the intervention group and in the controlgroup by 12% ( Table 3).The prevalence of insufficiency was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at baseline and 12 wk ( P=0.042 and P=0.034, respectively), but equal at 24 wk ( P=0.42).

supplement and an exercise program influenced serum vitamin B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations and markers of bone turnover in apparently healthy community-dwelling Chinese middle-aged and older adults, compared with a control groupwithoutintervention.Ourfindingsshowedthattheintervention was successful in improving vitamin B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations and the balance of bone turnover markers. Whereas no change was observed in the control group, the intervention group significantly improved in terms of serum vitamin B-12 concentrations.Overall, vitamin B-12concentrations were adequate (i.e., ≥150 pmol/L) at baseline, with low prevalence of deficiency in both groups,which may be attributed to the fact that the majority of the participants were younger than 65 y old.A difference in results may be expected when studies are conducted in older adults because vitamin B-12 deficiency is more prevalent in people aged 65 y and older (12).
The dietary vitamin B-12 intake was in line with the serumvitaminB-12concentrations(increaseintheinterventiongroup and stable values in the control group).Both groups had intakeswellabovetheChineseRNIforvitaminB-12of2.4 μg/d (26). In other parts of China, prevalence of low vitamin B-12 concentrations has ranged from 13.5% in Shanghai (deficiency defined as <139 pmol/L) ( 33) to 74.5% in rural North China (deficiency defined as <185 pmol/L) ( 34).To our knowledge, there are currently no data available on the vitamin B-12 status in the general population aged 50 y or older living in Hong Kong.Therefore, the need for improving vitamin B-12 statusin middle-aged and older adults in Hong Kong remains to be investigated.The fortified milk supplement was effective in achieving and maintaining serum 25(OH)D concentrations >50 nmol/L, which is currently recommended for prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 7).
In addition, a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 70–80 nmol/L has been suggested as the optimal level for a lower fracture risk and to support the skeleton ( 35,36). The intervention group met this level as well; mean serum concentrations increased to 80 nmol/L.A similar improvement in serum 25(OH)D concentrations after milk supplementation was also found in other studies inpostmenopausal Chinese women ( 17,18).The number of participants with vitamin D insufficiency decreasedovertimeinboththeinterventionandcontrolgroups.As there were multiple participants in the control group with a baselineserum25(OH)Dconcentrationclosetothecutoffvalue for vitamin D insufficiency ( <50 nmol/L; 13 participants had a concentration between 50.0 and 55.0 nmol/L), it is likely that evenaslightincreaseinserumconcentrationsmighthavecauseda shift in vitamin D status classification.
In addition, regardless of the treatment group, the participants were informed if they had low serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline togetherwith being given very general lifestyle advice to improve their concentrations. It is, however, important to note that the dietary vitamin D intake stayed the same over time (baselineto 24 wk) in the control group.This suggests that although a lifestyle change may influence serum 25(OH)D concentrations, acombinationoflifestyleandnutritionismoreeffective,asseenby the larger impact in the intervention group.Humanboneiscontinuouslyremodeledthroughaprocessof bone formation and resorption.Biomarkers of bone turnovercan be measured to assess bone remodeling rates.A decrease in the serum concentrations of PINP and CTX was seen with the intervention, whereas the concentrations remainedstable in the control group.
Decreased PINP concentrations do not necessarily mean that there is less bone formation ( 31).Likewise, decreased CTX concentrations do not automatically imply bone resorption. Therefore, an uncoupling ratio was calculated to arrive at an interpretation of the net effect (31,37).Although the median value for the uncoupling ratio was<1 for both groups, which would suggest net resorption, the ratio was significantly greater for the intervention group thanforthecontrolgroup.Thissuggeststhattherewaslessboneremodeling in the intervention group.Higher remodeling rates have been associated with an increased fracture risk and bone fragility( 37–42).AlthoughCTXandPINPvalueswerelowerin men than in women, the uncoupling ratio was similar for both sexes.A reduction in CTX and PINP concentrations after milksupplementation was also found in other studies investigating Chinese postmenopausal women ( 28,29,43).
Long-term trials investigating milk supplementation alone confirm the beneficialeffect on bone health. In the study of Lau et al.( 17), milk supplementation for 2 y in apparently healthy postmenopausal Chinese women aged 55–59 y resulted in less bone loss atdifferent sites.This was also found in the study of Chee et al.(18), who performed a 2-y milk supplementation study in apparently healthy postmenopausal Chinese women aged 50–65 y in Malaysia.Unfortunately,we had only indirect measures of bone health and no information about BMD.PTH helps the body to maintain stable concentrations of calcium in the blood ( 44).Suppression of PTH concentrations (by a high protein/calcium intake) may reduce bone resorption and thereby improve bone density ( 45).In the current study, the interaction time ×group for serum PTH concentrations wasnotsignificantbutconcentrationsintheinterventiongroup decreased significantly from baseline to 24 wk (mean change:11%).In contrast, Chee et al.
( 18) found that serum PTH concentrations of their control group significantly increased over time (figure-derived mean change from baseline: 50%),whereasPTHconcentrationsintheirinterventiongroupdidnot significantly change over time. This difference in effect could be explained by the lower calcium intakes of participants inthis study ( 46) and lower PTH baseline values.In the current study, 36% of the control group and 50% of the intervention group had elevated PTH concentrations at baseline (defined as>4.0 pmol/L).The baseline values of PINP and PTH (41.0 μg/L and 4.1 pmol/L, respectively) were in line with the estimatedreference concentrations for healthy Chinese adults aged 50–79 y (PINP: 36.9–52.7 μg/L; PTH: 3.7–4.0 pmol/L) (47).
However, mean CTX concentrations in our study were lower (320 and 311 pg/mL in the control and intervention, respectively) than the estimated reference concentration (445pg/mL)(47).Thismayindicate,keepinginmindinterlaboratory variances, a lower rate of bone resorption in our study population, suggesting that a greater effect of the interventionmay be expected in age-matched individuals. To the best of our knowledge, there are no comparable studies looking at the effect of a combined nutrition andexercise intervention on bone turnover markers or BMD.As described above, studies in Chinese women investigating milk supplementation alone have shown a reduction in boneturnover markers ( 28,29,43) and less bone loss ( 17–19).Multiplemeta-analyseshaveassessedtheeffectofexercisealone on BMD in older adults ( 48–52).All suggest that exercise can preserve or increase BMD to some extent, depending on the bone site and the duration, intensity, and type of exercises.
There is a lack of studies looking at the effect of long-termexercise on PINP and CTX concentrations in comparable populations. There is no conclusive evidence available on the Milk+exercise for B-12, 25(OH)D, and bone turnover 2117 optimal exercise intervention but it seems likely that resistance training, potentially combined with other forms of exercise, should be included.Because both nutrition alone and exercise alone can affect bone turnover markers or BMD, it remains tobe investigated if a combined intervention has synergistic or additive effects.The calcium intake at baseline was comparable with the mean daily calcium intake in men and women aged 60–84 y in Hong Kong (410 and 420 mg/d, respectively) ( 53).
The intervention increased calcium intake successfully (from520to1.39 ×10 3mg/d)butnochangewasobservedforprotein intake.Themilksupplementprovidedonlyanadditional13.6g protein/d.Furthermore,proteinintake(g ·kg−1·d−1)wasequal to or above the current RDA of 0.8 g ·kg−1·d−1in almost all cases. For healthy adults older than 65 y, a protein intakeabove the RDA may be beneficial for bone health (higher BMD, slowerrateofboneloss,reducedboneturnover,andreducedhip fracture risk) ( 11,54).Still, the majority of the participants in both groups met the criteria of 1.0 and 1.2 g ·kg −1·d−1.Note thatourstudypopulationalsoincludedmiddle-agedadults(50– 65 y).The already adequate protein intake, combined with thenutritionalimprovementsandimprovedoveralllevelofphysical activity ( 25), could have contributed to the improved bone turnover ( 11,55).A limitation of this study is the absence of a nutrition or exercise group alone.
Consequently, it is not possible to conclude which component or which combination ofcomponents of the intervention contributed the most to our positive findings regarding bone turnover. However, as stated before, a stronger effect may be expected when nutrition andexercise interventions are combined ( 7,22,23,56).Because there is little information available about the nutritional status of the general population aged 50 y or older living in HongKong, we are unable to conclude if our study population was a representative sample or that they were healthier.At least in this study population, the supplement was not needed toimprove vitamin B-12 concentrations.Lastly, the sex-specific results should be interpreted with caution.The power of the study might be inadequate to detect sex-specific differences inserum vitamin concentrations and bone markers between the control and intervention groups.
Strengths of the current study include the low dropout rate and moderate to high compliance to the proposed intervention, which also indicates that this program may be sustainable over the long term. Furthermore, we were able to see improvements in nutritional status and bone markers in individualswithrelativelygoodbaselinevalues.Thisalsoshowsthe potential of the intervention program for more vulnerable groups, for example, frail older adults.Lastly, previous studies about nutritional and exercise interventions for improvementof bone health have largely focused on (postmenopausal) women.Osteoporosis in men is an underappreciated medical concern, even though it is known that hip fractures in menare associated with greater mortality than in women ( 57).No remarkable sex differences were seen for the uncoupling ratio in the current study, showing that also male adults canbenefit.
In conclusion, this study showed that milk supplementation in combination with exercise is effective in improving vitaminB-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations and bone turnover of apparently healthy community-dwelling Chinese middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, it contributes to the knowledge onhowtopreventandreducemalnutritionandosteoporosisinthe rapidly aging population of Hong Kong.Acknowledgments The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—RC, JW, SO, MCEB,andLCPGMdG:designedtheresearch;RC,JW,andSO: conducted the research; JW, PP, and LCPGMdG: periodicallyreviewed the quality of the data; IG: analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript; JW and LCPGMdG: had primary responsibility for the final content; and all authors: criticallyreviewed the manuscript and read and approved the final manuscript.References 1.Census and Statistics Department.Hong Kong population projections, 2017–2066.Hong Kong: Demographic Statistics Section, Census andStatistics Department; 2017.2.Woo J.
