Collagen hydrolyzates and ultrahydrolyzates are terms used to describe collagens that have been broken down into small peptides and amino acids in the presence of collagenases and high pressure. Recent Findings This article reviews the relevant literature and serves as a White Paper on collagen hydrolyzates and ultrahydrolyzates as emerging supplements often advertised to support joint health in OA.Collagen hydrolyzates have demon- strated some evidence of efficacy in a handful of small scale clinical trials, but their ability to treat and reverse advanced joint disease remains highly speculative, as is the case for other nutritional supplements.Summary The aim of this White Paper is to stimulate research and development of collagen-based supplements for patients with OA and other musculoskeletal diseases at academic and industrial levels.This White Paper does not make any treatment Ursule Kalvaityte, Ilona Uzieliene, Christina E.Larder and Michèle M.

Keywords Joint health .Osteoarthritis .Nutritional supplement .Nutraceutical .Denatured collagen .Collagen hydrolyzate .Collagen ultra-hydrolyzate Introduction OA is believed to impact more than 300 million people worldwide [ 1].It is estimated that a “tsunami ”of new OA cases will hit countries with a much larger agingpopulation in the developed world by the year 2050 [ 2].
However, these numbers provided by epidemiological studies are likely an underestimation, and the true bur- den of OA is likely to be much higher as accurate dataare not available for sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, or South America. A recent commentary pub- lished in The Lancet has proposed that the incidence ofOA is much higher, estimated at around 7% of the global population; this means that more than 500 mil- lion people worldwide have OA [ 3].OA is an especially problematic disease as there are cur- rently no effective pharmacological treatments and no dis-ease modifying OA drugs (DMOADs).There is some cor-relation between published treatment guidelines overall but there is no clear consensus in any of the treatment guidelines regarding nutraceuticals and supplements.Furthermore, theguidelines and recommendations for the management of OA are difficult to follow for m ost healthcare professionals and patients, often leaving them dissatisfied and confused.
Patients also remain dissatisfied with the currently approved pharmacological interventions; in the absence of DMOADs, they resort to using nutritional supplementsand nutraceuticals. Recent guidelines have been published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), Arthritis Foundation (AF), the European League AgainstRheumatism (EULAR), the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO), and OsteoarthritisResearch Society International (OARSI) [ 4–6].The recent ACR/AF 2020 OA treatment guidelines only focus on man-agement options that are available in the USA and are re-stricted to pharmacologic t herapies and agents that are available in pharmaceutical-grade formulations, thuseliminating consideration for most nutraceuticals accord-i n gt oA C Ra n dF D Ac r i t e r i a[ 7,8].
The OARSI 2019 treatment guidelines do not include nutraceutical prod-ucts because the OARSI expert group has stronglyargued that the formulations have not yet been standard- ized [ 9]. However, the ESCEO 2019 Treatment Guidelines Working Group continues to advocate for the use “pharmaceutical grade ”or“prescription grade ” crystalline glucosamine sulfate (GS) and chondroitinsulfate (CS) as step 1 in pharmacological treatment.ESCEO argues that the formulations for GS and CS in Europe are standardized as “pharmaceutical grade ”or “prescription grade” [10].The lack of consensus on supplements creates major challenges for the research community, healthcare pro- fessionals, and OA patients, especially those who con-tinue to use supplements combined with over-the- counter (OTC) medications [ 11].
Individuals with OA using supplements also report using OTC products in combination with prescription products and the likeli- hood of using prescription pr oducts increases with the length of OA history [ 11]. This suggests that patients continue consuming supplements irrespective of whatthe treatment guidelines might state.Another major challenge in the use of nutritional sup- plements in OA is the use of terminology; vocabularyused to describe supplements is highly variable.Some papers refer to these products as food supplementswhile others refer to them as nutritional supplements or nutraceuticals.The literature often refers to them as complementary and alternative medicines, and there arepapers that refer to plant-derived supplements as botan- ical and herbal supplements.The phrases “food supple- ments ”and “nutraceuticals ”have been used interchange- ably since both types of supplements claim to benefithealth.
It is important to define key terms that have been accepted by regulatory agencies (Table 1). Nutraceuticals are derived from a food or part of a food that is aimed toward disease prevention or treat- ment, whereas food supplemen ts are generally referred to as single substances used either alone or in a mixture to support micronutrient needs [ 12].In this White Paper, we discuss, among other agents, the potential for using collagen or collagen hydrolyzates as novel and innovative nutraceuticals to support joint health and provide prophylactic treatment for people with OA.78 Page 2 of 15 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 Opportunities for Management of OA with Nutraceuticals Nutraceuticals and natural products for OA are sold and marketed for their antioxidative and anti-inflammatoryproperties, with many manufacturers claiming they possess therapeutic, anabolic, and regenerative effects [ 15–18].
Recently published data from a small number of studies of herbal and botanical nutraceuticals developed from natural products have provided promising efficacy data com- pared to placebo comparators, but their potential fortreating OA requires further confirmation in larger clin- ical trials [ 19,20]. Currently, nutraceuticals constitute a wide variety of natu- ral product extracts generated from different plants and ani-mals, as well as their derived active ingredients [ 4].Although nutraceuticals have gained enormous popularity in patient- driven inflammatory disease management, detailed mechanis- tic evidence of their efficacy in OA is still lacking [ 21].Collagen Supplements Non-hydrolyzed Collagen These nutritional supplements are often a by-product from the food industry.
Collagen supplements are rich in amino acids such as glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline; all of which play important roles in the building of joint cartilage and may alsohave anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and have been speculated to act as signaling molecules [ 5]. While a seminal study published in Science in 1993 revealed efficacy of oral type II collagen supplementation in reducing joint swelling in RA [ 6], trials into the role of collagen supplementation in treating OA have demonstrated inconsistent results [ 19].There have been several reported analgesic and anti- inflammatory effects of collagen in unpublished clinical trials,but according to recently published systematic and nar- rative reviews, these have not been reproduced across studies [ 19, 20].Further trials with improved study designs are therefore needed to evaluate their proposed nutraceutical potential (Fig.1).
Nutraceutical supplements derived from collagen can be made from beef, pork, or fish bones and skins, which undergoprocessing to increase the bioavailability of their amino acids and/or peptides; the enzymatic hydrolysis of collagens en-hances the postprandial absorption of its processed compo- nents [ 22]. Processed and pre-digested collagen products are called collagen hydrolyzates CHs and are sold in the form of collagen capsules at pharmacies and health food suppliers.Different processing and manufacturing methods to make col- lagen hydrolyzates can yield different products, with differ-ences in amino acid content and peptide sequences that vary in molecular weight (MW).Lower MW peptides may be more easily absorbed in the small intestine, increasing the likelihoodof delivery to other areas in the body such as joints (Fig.

Because type II collagen is the main protein in cartilage, there have been sug- gestions that oral collagen supplementation may help tosupport cartilage repair.However, definitive proof for this is still lacking.Different formulations of collagen have beendeveloped based on the degree of hydrolysis, the most preva- lent being undenatured collagen and hydrolyzed collagen.Fig.1 Schematic illustration of the ultrahydrolyzed collagen concept Fig.
2 Proposed concept for the delivery of collagen-derived peptides to the synovial joint. Possible mechanism forimmunometabolic andphenotypic reprogramming of macrophages by peptides derived from ultrahydrolyzed andhydrolyzed collagen78 Page 4 of 15 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 Undenatured Collagen Undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) is a patented agent that is often derived from chicken cartilage and has been used in various clinical trials in humans and companion animals, in- cluding dogs and horses [ 23–25,26,27].Undenatured col- lagen is biochemically modified (glycosylated), has a good safety profile [ 28], and has been speculated, but not proven, to possess immunomodulatory properties.To what extent undenatured collagen is digested and absorbed following in- gestion in vivo in humans remains to be assessed, but it has been speculated that potential bioactive peptides may be pre-served and absorbed as free amino acids, especially glycine and proline.
These amino acids represent quantitatively im- portant precursors for the synthesis of cartilage extracellularmatrix (ECM) macromolecules. Whether UC-II, glycosylated or biochemically modified by some other means, has functional benefits beyond the provi-sion of relevant amino acids as precursors for de novo colla- gen protein synthesis, will be an important area of research and innovation and exemplifies an opportunity for furtherevidence-based product development by consumer health companies.Work in this space will need to systematically correlate efficacy at reducing symptoms with mechanism of action, with adaptive trial designs and with many open ques- tions remaining on the ability of UC-II to exert direct effectson cartilage metabolism in joints.Hydrolyzed Collagen Hydrolyzed collagen is a form of collagen that is also referred to as collagen hydrolyzate.
Collagen hydrolyzate and gelatin may be the same in terms of amino acid composition, but theypossess different chemical properties. Collagen is a native protein molecule with a molecular weight of ~300 kDa [ 29]; and collagen hydrolyzates are processed intensively to break up the large collagen molecules into smaller fragments to in- crease absorption (Fig.1).To produce hydrolyzed collagen, native collagen un- dergoes denaturation followed by a hydrolysis process,resulting in very low molecular mass (3 –6 kDa) collagen pep- tides, compared to native collagen size (285 –300 kDa) [ 29].Different processing and post-processing methods to makecollagen hydrolyzates can yield vastly different products, cre- ating different collagen peptide sequences and molecular weights.These differences can potentially impact biological function in terms of regulating joint inflammation and effecton subchondral bone.
Furthermore, lower molecular weight collagen peptides may be more easily absorbed in the small intestine, theoretically increasing the likelihood of being de-livered to other areas in the body including joints. The resis- tance of collagen peptides to hydrolysis and digestion is pri- marily based on amino acid composition.In that regard,peptides with the amino acid proline or hydroxyproline are not readily hydrolyzed, or digested by the gastrointestinal sys- tem which may allow them to be absorbed in the small intes-tine.In support, peptides such as Pro-Hyp and Pro-Hyp-Gly, derived from the repeating motif Pro-Hyp-Gly, have been reported to circulate in the blood up to 4 h after oral collagenand gelatin ingestion [ 30,31].Thus far, there are no published studies that have conducted a quantitative assessment of theactual quantity of collagen derived peptides that are absorbedin the gastrointestinal tract and/or released in the circulation.
A number of clinical trials have been conducted concerning oral supplementation of collagen and its derivatives,undenatured and hydrolyzed collagen. All have shown to be safe and tolerable for the patient, causing no or only mild adverse effects to some patients [ 32,33].One of the concerns regarding oral collagen supplementation is associated with oral tolerance.Oral tolerance is the ability of orally adminis- tered antigen to suppress or minimize the immune response,and has been used to manage the occurrence of immunoge- nicity in other disease areas [ 34–39].As for oral tolerance associated with collagen, the response relies on structural properties of the collagen derivative be-cause only specific epitopes found in an intact helix structure of the undenatured collagen are recognized by the immune system.
The epitopes interact with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and result in reduction of systemic T cell attackon the cartilage as well as reduced joint inflammation and cartilage damage [ 40–42]. This suggests that, if taken orally, hydrolyzed collagen is digested and broken down into small peptides and amino acids, thus potentially eliminating its im- munomodulatory properties.Due to its lower molecular weight, hydrolyzed collagen has been proposed to have higher bioavailability and solubility,and thus better absorption from the small intestine compared to undenatured collagen [ 22,29].Absorption of orally admin- istered hydrolyzed collagen has been evaluated by studying vascular-perfused rat intestine in situ.The results implied that the breakdown products of hydrolyzed collagen digestion canbe absorbed as small peptides [ 43].
Defining and understand- ing the difference between collagen products, collagen hydro-lyzates, and ultrahydrolyzed collagen can be difficult, confus-ing, and remains unclear in the literature. Studies evaluating collagen digestion and amino acid and/ or peptide absorption in vivo in humans are required to ad-dress the proposed differences in the postprandial bioavail- ability of collagen-derived amino acids and peptides.In vitro studies have been used to suggest that collagen derived peptides may: (a) potentially accumulate in cartilage(if given in sufficiently high doses); (b) stimulate chondrocytes to synthesize ECM macromolecules in vitro;and (c) increase osteoblast activity as well as decrease osteo- clastic activity [ 44,45,46–48].However, whether such pep- tides are actually absorbed and released in an in vivo settingPage 5 of 15 78 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 remains highly speculative.
Further studies are required to identify such absorbable bioactive peptides derived from (hydrolyzed) collagen digestion, as the impact of digestionand first pass metabolism on the generation of bioactive pep- tides from collagen hydrolyzates remains to be investigated. Such research may help to identify peptides and amino acidscontributing to the proposed antioxidant and anti- inflammatory properties of collagen hydrolyzate supplemen- tation.In this regard, preclinical research using innovativesimulated digestion models in combination with relevant cell/tissue cultures can become an innovative higher through- put platform for investigating new collagen hydrolyzateformulations.The early papers that appeared on collagen hydrolyzates reported efficacy in the preclinical context (beneficial effectson cartilage metabolism) and improvements in joint pain in the clinical context.
Bello and Oesser reviewed the available literature on collagen supplements without date limits andpublished their results in 2006 [ 44]. In addition to published papers, they included abstracts presented at scientific con-gresses and articles published in German medical journals[44].They reported that orally administered collagen hydro- lyzate end products can be taken up by the intestine and ac-cumulate in cartilage [ 44].They also proposed that collagen hydrolyzate ingestion can stimulate the synthesis of ECMmacromolecules.Bello and Oesser identified four open-labeland three double-blind studies.Although some of these clin- ical trials were of very low quality, they reported that collagen hydrolyzates are safe and may improve pain and function inmen and women with OA and other arthritic conditions.It is important to note, however, that the authors included other joint diseases in their review and their focus was not exclu-sively on OA.
In a trial investigating hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract supplementation in dogs, the combined treatment de-creased indicators of pain in dogs that received the combina- tion product for 3 months. However, the biomarkers selected for evaluation of the effects of supplementation (Coll2 –1a n d Coll2 –1N O 2 )w e r eu n a f f e c t e d[ 49].An equine study from Utrecht University examined the effect of supplementation with collagen hydrolyzates and amulti-ingredient supplement for 60 days on experimentally induced acute synovitis in horses [ 50].Synovitis was induced in the right intercarpal joint by intra-articular injection of 0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli .
Although supplementation with collagen hydrolyzates andthe combination product showed anti-inflammatory effectsin this validated synovitis model and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels were reduced compared with placebo, no statis- tical differences were seen with respect to interleukin 6 (IL-6),glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the biomarker CPII, or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) among treatment groups.A supplement called PETAGILE, which provides collagen peptides, was orally administered to horses with mild or mod- erate OA for 3 months with daily doses of 25 g and 50 g. Aweekly questionnaire to horse owners was provided in order to follow the progress of horse behavior and willingness to run.All 28 horses, (16 received 25 g/day and 12 received 50g/day of PENTAGILE), improved their mobility and showed increased willingness to run when compared to the placebo group.
The higher dosage (50 g) supplementation was con-cluded to be more effective and promising enough to further test in longer term studies [ 51]. Clark and colleagues performed a 24-week clinical study on the use of collagen hydrolyzates as a dietary supplement in147 healthy athletes with activity-related joint pain who were physically fit, active, and had no evidence of joint disease[52].The study design involved 72 males and 75 females randomly assigned to two groups.The experimental group(n= 73) received 25 mL of a liquid formulation of 10 g of collagen hydrolyzates.The placebo group ( n= 74) received 25 mL of liquid xanthan.The primary measured outcome wasa change in the visual analog scales (assessed by a physician)from baseline during the study phase in relation to pain, mo- bility, and inflammation.The team investigated joint pain at rest and when walking, standing, carrying objects, and lifting.
This was the first clinical trial that used a healthy population as a study group and showed improvement in joint discomfortand pain in the group given an oral supplement containing collagen hydrolyzates. Despite the small sample size and lim- itations of the study, the results suggested that athletes per-ceived a benefit from consuming collagen hydrolyzates [ 52].A clinical study in 15 healthy male subjects was carried out to determine and compare the plasma concentrations of fourrepresentative amino acids from collagen (glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine) following a single ad- ministration of a fresh fermented milk product containing hy-drolyzed collagen [ 53].This was a single-center, ran- domized open crossover study.In a fasting state, the15 healthy subjects randomly received a single dose ofproduct 1 (10 g of collagen hydrolyzate in 100 mL of milk) or product 2 (10 g of collagen hydrolyzate dis- solved in 100 mL of water).
The study showed thatconsumption of milk containing collagen hydrolyzate increased the concentration of collagen-specific amino acids in plasma. This suggests that orally ingested col-lagen hydrolyzates might increase the plasma concentra- tions of collagen-derived amino acids that could poten- tially reach tissues in the synovial joint.Another clinical trial used a randomized double-blind, con- trolled study design and recruited 250 subjects with primaryknee OA to assess the efficacy of a collagen hydrolyzate sup-plementation on OA pain and function [ 54].The patients were given 10 g collagen hydrolyzate daily for 6 months.The78 Page 6 of 15 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 authors reported a significant improvement in knee joint func- tion and pain as assessed by visual analog scales as well as the the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OsteoarthritisIndex (WOMAC) pain subscales.
Subjects with the greatest joint deterioration, and with the lowest intake of meat protein in their diets, appeared to benefit the most. The study conclud-ed that collagen hydrolyzates are safe and effective and war- rant further consideration as a functional food ingredient [ 54].McAlindon and colleagues performed biochemical and im- aging studies to examine the effect of collagen supplementa-tion in human patients with OA.They attempted to determine whether either of two MRI approaches, delayed gadoliniumenhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC), or T2 mapping, might detect short-term changes in knee cartilage among individuals taking a formulation ofcollagen hydrolyzates.Their early results suggest that the dGEMRIC MRI technique may be able to detect changes in proteoglycan content in knee cartilage in individuals takingcollagen hydrolyzate after 24 weeks compared to placebo [55].
Only weak correlations were observed between changes in dGEMRIC and biochemical markers, suggesting that the study duration was insufficient to detect measurable changes in biomarkers or that the biomarkers they selected were insuf- ficiently sensitive and discriminatory. They found a positive effect of collagen hydrolyzates on cartilage morphology in patients with knee OA in their interventional OA study(ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT00536302) [ 56].However, they could not identify any consistent correlations in changes incollagen and proteoglycan biomarkers PIIANP and CS846with changes of the dGEMRIC scores in patients who had received oral collagen hydrolyzates.An important weakness of this study was that the authors were looking for short-termchanges which are difficult to detect, even after 48 weeks of oral treatment with collagen hydrolyzates.
Although the study was time limited, the dGEMRIC score increased in the medialand lateral tibial regions of the knee joint in participants who were given collagen hydrolyzate compared to placebo. A systematic review published in 2012 examined the evi- dence on the symptomatic and chondroprotective effects ofcollagen derivatives in OA.They reported that there is insuf- ficient evidence to recommend the generalized use of collagenhydrolyzates in daily practice for the treatment of patients with OA [ 57].They proposed that the overall quality of evidence was moderate to very poor and recommended more indepen- dent and high-quality studies to assess the proposed therapeu- tic effects of collagen derivatives on OA.It is important to note that they did not include studies on only collagen hydro-lyzates; they reviewed the evidence from eight different stud- ies: six on collagen hydrolyzates, two on gelatin, and one on undenatured type II collagen (UC-II).
As previously men-tioned, processing of collagen and their hydrolyzates may result in formulations with differing peptide and amino acid profiles, which may affect patient outcome.A study published in 2017 examined the metabolic re- sponses of human OA cartilage to biochemically character-ized and fractionated collagen hydrolyzates [ 58]. It compared three different collagen hydrolyzates, two from fish (Peptan® F 5000, Peptan® F 2000) and one from pigs (Mobiforte®) and used biochemical (fluorescence) and biophysical techniquesto characterize the products and their effects on human OA cartilage.It also determined the total number of peptides with- in each product and the peptides that were common betweenthem.The investigators found that none of the three collagen hydrolyzates had the ability to positively modulate colla- gen biosynthesis in human knee cartilage explants.Theauthors noted that Peptan® F 2000 enhanced the activities of aggrecanases ADMATS4 and ADMATS5 in vitro.
Furthermore, IL-6, MMP-1, -3, and -13 levels were ele-vated in explants that were treated with Mobiforte® and Peptan® F 5000. This study concluded that due to the heterogeneous peptide composition and disparate pharma-cological effects among different collagen hydrolyzates, the effect of a particular preparation or processing cannot be extrapolated to other formulations.Although there are promising collagen hydrolyzates, the literature has been riddled with poorly designed and executedstudies decreasing the credibility of published material, even though positive effects have been demonstrated.For example, another poor study on fish collagen hydrolyzates was pub-lished by a group based in Thailand.This group claimed that collagen hydrolyzates can m odulate cartilage metabolism [59].Despite being published, the study was fundamentally flawed because the authors only looked at the effects of col-lagen hydrolyzates on cartilage explants.
Knowing that the explant model is not always suitable for mechanistic studiesof hydrolysate action, the results from this study should be interpreted with caution. The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary and botanical supplements for OA looked at the evi-dence supporting the use of collagen hydrolyzates define and UC-II.Although their analysis showed significant improve-ments on pain, the quality of the published evidence was low and thus the clinical studies were deemed to have limited clinical impact [ 19].The poor quality of published literature highlights the many knowledge gaps regarding collagen- based nutraceuticals, which require further high-powered and well-designed studies to propose evidence-based recommendations.Emerging Research for Collagen Hydrolyzates Research into collagen hydrolyzates has primarily focused onthe benefits these products can have on joints, most often on cartilage tissue and subchondral bone.
However, new and emerging fields of research have shown promise regardingPage 7 of 15 78 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 the additional health benefits these supplements can provide, due to their significant peptide and amino acid content and their general tolerability. A key new direction of the field isin the study of how collagen hydrolyzates support biological effects that are relevant in OA, with an emerging interest in how these supplements may modulate the gut microbiome byacting as potential pre-biotics (Fig.3).The classical definition of a prebiotic is a food component that can change the activityor growth of the microorganisms found in the gastrointestinaltract.Changing the growth o f different members of the microbiome can have implications in human health via mod-ulation of the immune system and the production of metabolicbyproducts of the gut flora that have biological action in the host.
The gut microbiome is the community of bacteria that re- sides in the gastrointestinal tract, includes the metabolicbyproducts produced by the resident microbes. The amount of bacteria in and on the human body is far greater than thenumber of eukaryotic cells.The microbiome has a substantial impact on human health and clinical outcomes.The gut microbiome has been shown to affect multiple physiologicalpathways and disease states, including colon cancer, amyotro- phic lateral sclerosis, RA, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syn- drome (MetS), and Alzheimer ’s disease.It is implicated in numerous inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases such as in-flammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syn-drome, and it is known to influence various musculoskeletal diseases, OA, and osteoporosis (OP) [ 60–65].A recent study by Schott et al.(2018) investigated the role of the gutmicrobiome in the context of obesity-associated OA [ 66].
Obesity was induced using a high-fat diet with mice that were given a lean diet as a control. OA was induced using destabi-lization of the medial meniscus surgery.Mice were then sup- plemented either with oligofructose, a nondigestible prebiotic fiber, or cellulose, a control fiber.Results demonstrated thatthe gut microbiome of obese mice reverted to a state similar to that of the lean control mice after prebiotic supplementation.In the context of obesity, oligofructose supported the growthof key microflora, particularly Bifidobacterium pseudolongum .Furthermore, obese mice treated with oligofructose demonstrated cartilage preservation and an in-creased number of chondrocytes in the tibia and femur, as well as decreased OARSI scoring.No histological differences were observed in mice fed a low fat diet with or without prebioticsupplementation.
Both systemic and synovial inflammation in obese mice were also reduced by oligofructose supplementa- tion and the consequent changes in the microbiome. This re-port provided the first strong evidence for a link between the gut microbiome and OA [ 66].This connection between the microbiome and joint health may also explain why some in- dividuals respond to collagen hydrolyzate supplements while others do not.Interindividual differences in digestion and ab- sorption rate of collagen hydrolyzate peptides and amino acids could also influence a patient ’sr e s p o n s e .Perhaps the most intriguing explanation for interindividual differences in the digestion, uptake, and efficacy of collagenhydrolyzates and nutraceuticals in general is the substantial variability between the microbiomes of different individuals.Fig.
3 Possible mechanism of pre- or pre-biotic modulation by collagen derivatives78 Page 8 of 15 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 Countless intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including diet, genet- ics, exercise level, diurnal rhythm, and even time of day con- tribute to different microbiome states within the niche of anindividual gastrointestinal tract. Even when these factors are controlled, as in animal studies using defined diet, light cycle, and age matched controls, the specific microbiome fingerprintremains different between individual animals.In a recent mouse study of gut microbiome, OA, and nutraceuticals, different microbiome profiles resulted fromconsumption of standard chow, high fat, and lean diets, and overlay of supplementation with UC-II or GS led to signifi- cant shifts in the constituent microbes [ 67].
Although the microbiome of each animal was distinct from all other ani- mals, clear types were produced by the different supplements, with Veillonella ,Bifidobacteria , and Ruminococcus genera contributing substantially to these profiles. It is unsurprising that defined diet influences both the gut microbiome and OA outcomes in mice.What is intriguing isthat dietary supplementation wi th nutraceuticals like chondroi- tin sulfate (CS) causes shifts in the gut microbiome within thes a m ec o n t r o ld i e ti nm i c e[ 68].In these animals, CS supplemen- tation resulted in butyrogenic changes in the microbiome me- tabolism and lowered inflammatory LPS levels in circulationand caused a concomitant decrease in proinflammatory taxa a n di n c r e a s ei na n t i - i n f l a m m a tory taxa.Because OA has been s h o w nt ob ead i s e a s eo fi n f l a m m a tion, it is possible that the action of CS on OA is via the gut microbiome.
In human metabolism, degradation of CS is both variable and dictated in part by the innate gut microbiome. A 2016 study found that CS breakdown was caused by three different Bacteroides species in the gut found in all human participants.Even more interestingly, individuals in the study possessed at least two taxa that were not found in other study members that could also degrade CS [ 69].It appears that the gut microbiome contributes to the metabolism of CS, within different popula- tion groups as well as between individual members of the groups; based on this it is not surprising that nutraceutical response is variable in the published literature.In a study examining microbiome and OA changes caused by dietary supplementation with either GS orUC-II, a distinct microbiome profile was found for eachgroup.A low Bacteroidetes/F irmicutes ratio has been associated with a proinflammatory state in both miceand humans [ 70,71].
Compared to mice that were not given a nutraceutical, supplementation with either GS or UC-II resulted in a higher Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio [67]. Individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were different in animals given nutraceuticals compared to animals given control fibers; furthermore, OTUs were significantly different depending on whether GS or UC-II was provided.Overall, the study found that supple- mentation with either GS or UC-II resulted in OTU changes that could be associated with loweredinflammatory states; ingestion of UC-II caused more changes in OTU abundances compared to GS, but there were nutraceutical specific microbiome changes in thecase of GS and Rikenellaceae .Perhaps most crucially, dietary supplementation with either nutraceutical in-creased tibial total and uncalcified cartilage area, as wellas Safranin O chondrocytes, compared to the control fiber, in a post-traumatic OA (PTOA) model.
Collectively, these data implicate the gut microbiomeas a mediator of nutraceutical action on OA outcomes. Because of the microbiome and gastrointestinal tract rele- vance to nutraceuticals and OA, future collagen and OA re-search needs to implement the latest gastrointestinal models; these need to be scalable, fast, and physiologically relevant.Initiatives to make these digestion models more affordableand accessible have started [ 72–74].Future use of computer a controlled dynamic digestion model inoculated with humanfecal matter can be used to investigate the digestibility ofcollagen hydrolyzates and their effect on the microbiome.In such bioreactor models, the stomach, small intestine, and three colonic vessels (ascending, transverse, and descending) arecontinuously agitated, pH controlled, and the digesta are pro- pelled along the simulated gut model using peristaltic pumps.
As our understanding of the microbiome and its impacts on overall health and OA evolve, simulated gut model studies investigating supplements that are readily available to patientsare required to determine both the beneficial and potentially deleterious effects these products may have on the gastroin- testinal system and how they affect OA. Gastrointestinal mo dels provide a unique opportunity to test collagen hydrolyzate products, as well as other drugs.Thesemodels can be inoculated with dif ferent human gut microbiota, allowing the impact of nutraceuticals and newly developed drugs on the gastrointestinal tract to be investigated.These models could also utilize the microbiota of patients with vary-ing degrees of OA, first to determine if the microbiome between OA patients at different stages a re different, and then to inves- tigate the impact of new treatme nts.
This model could function as a pre-clinical tool where the safety and toxicity of new drugs and nutraceuticals can be determined. Challenges of Research with Nutraceuticals Regulations Due to the “non-medical ”origin of nutraceuticals, there is a lack of regulatory methods and proof of efficacy re- quirements in Europe and the USA.But like pharma-ceutical products, nutraceuticals should require strict regulations and evidence-based research that confirm ef- ficacy, safety, and benefits to the patient [ 14].Page 9 of 15 78 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 Measurement Control OA is lacking an established measurement –control system for an objective evaluation of pre-c linical changes potentially indi- cating an important windows of treatment opportunity.Recognizing OA in the early pre-OA or early OA phase isincreasingly accepted as being such a window of opportunity.
MRI has the capacity to diagnose OA in this early phase and DMOADs developed by Merck and Novartis have used thisimaging technique for the assess ment of structural progression [75]. For DMOADs, both functional and structural outcomes are considered mandatory by the FDA.Next to MRI,biochemical markers measured in synovial fluid, but preferably non-invasively, from urine, or from plasma or serum may aid the timing, registries and database buildingfollowed by outcome measuremen t and algorithm building to support joint-preserving treatments for OA in the field of life-style/nutrition, pharmacological interventions, and joint-preserving surgery.Ideally, such a measurement –control sys- tem is species independent to translate the same outcome mea-sures from animal studies to clinical implementation.In thislight, developments in the area of high-field MRI, mass spec- trometry, and a combination thereof, are highly promising.
Animal Studies Animal studies are generally slow, costly and predictions of bio-absorbability do not always align with human clinical data owing due to species differences in intestinal permeability and metabolic activity [ 76,77]. The bioavailability of food com- ponents is determined by first-pass metabolism, which in- volves absorption by enterocytes found in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by liver metabolism before entering the sys-temic circulation [ 78,79].Bioavailability studies of food com- ponents and pharmaceuticals using animal models have pre-viously established poor correlation between rats and humans.Due to these species differences in intestinal permeability and metabolic activity, in vitro digestion and cell culture models, rather than animal models, are often used to assess the diges-tion profile and intestinal transport of orally administered food components or drugs.
In vitro digestion models are often used to assess for nutrient digestion before first pass metabolism, ashuman trials are difficult and impractical for routine nutrient bioavailability assessments [ 80–82]. Previous and ongoing validation studies continue to support the use of in vitro di-gestion models for testing nutrient digestion, and for bioactive peptides, by comparing to in vivo results [ 82,83].One of the limitations of previous research on collagen products is that they have often used these products directly on tissues, such as cartilage, to determine their effects, but in a physiologicalcontext, these products first undergo digestion and first pass metabolism.Future research needs to consider more holistic and physiologically relevant approaches to validatemechanisms of action of collagen-based products for the treat- ment of OA.
Human studies Human studies provide the most accurate and valuable out- comes, although there are still several limitations and study design choices which should be taken into consideration. One of these parameters is the choice of test and control groups,which should be distinguishable from one another, and the selection of either of these groups must be based on specific demographic and population variables.For example, as nutri-tional requirements differ according to a person ’s age, the target population of a nutraceutical should be focused on aspecific age group.If the target population is the elderly, dif-ficulties arise as it is challenging to identify all risk factors, comorbidities, and possible interactions, as well as to model a study according to all these aspects.
The exposure tonutraceuticals and the interindividual variation of response are also crucial aspects, as well as the fact that nutraceuticals are subjected to intestinal bacterial metabolism which cangenerate active or inactive metabolites. Capping off the com- plexity are considerations around disease etiology.The OA syndrome is not driven by a single pathogenic mechanism,but rather can be initiated by various factors including age, obesity, genetics, and injury.Specific supplements may have efficacy in one context but not another, and so studies shouldconsider information about likely initiators of degeneration.To understand the effects of a nutraceutical with these vari- ables in mind, studies with large populations and elevatedfinancial expense are necessary [ 84].Other crucial features of a study to be considered are duration, timing, and budget.
The formulation in which a nutraceutical is manufactured c a na l s oh a v ea ni m p a c tr e l a t e dt ot h ep h a r m a c o k i n e t i c so ft h e relevant bioactives in terms of absorption, distribution, metab- olism, and excretion (ADME). The ADME can determinefactors such as dose, half-life, and frequency of intake of the supplement that impact bioactivities.Formulation may not necessarily cause adverse effects or be harmful to therapeuticoutcomes but could alter the absorption rate and efficacy of the nutraceutical.Formulation should be chosen according to the origin of the functional elements included in the prepara-tion, its solubility, resistance to pH changes, and impact of shifts in the microbiota on permeability and stability of the nutraceutical.
Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS) com- pared to simple and widely used formulations offer advan- tages by enhancing stability, providing sustained release,and protecting the compound(s) from physical or chemical degradation [ 85]. Many challenges surround the evaluation of nutraceutical efficacy, safety, and regulations.As interest and consumerconsumption increases, the lack of clear clinical evidence is still a limitation.To address this and ensure the best outcomes78 Page 10 of 15 Curr Rheumatol Rep (2021) 23: 78 for consumers, a variety of complementary research ap- proaches are needed.In that regard, in vitro studies can be used to provide proof of concept, for safety assessment, andto help understand how a supplement might impact on struc- ture and function.Appropriate animal models for OA can also aid in assessments of nutraceuticals in terms of potency, safe-ty, and mechanisms of action.
These studies can evaluate the impact of both acute and long-term nutraceutical supplemen- tation and control for confounding variables such as genetics,sex, and background diet. In vitro and in vivo preclinical stud- ies aid the determination of relevant biomarkers, outcome measures, and the experimental design for human nutraceuti-cal studies, which are crucial for validation.Clinical studies remain the most verifiable approach to evaluate how interin- dividual variabilities in gut microbiota and host response in-volving differing genetic, biochemical, and anatomical char- acteristics can impact the health promoting properties of nutraceuticals.It should be recognized, however, that thecomplexity of nutraceutical metabolism leads to a large vari- ety of metabolites that make it unlikely to characterize all pertinent features of metabolic activity.
Moreover, a wide va-riety of baseline lifestyle factors including nutritional status, and background dietary and exercise habits could lead to var- iable interindividual responses to nutraceutical supplementation. Future Innovations in Nutraceuticals By 2025, the collagen market is estimated to be valued at $6.63 billion, and in this year alone, U.S.consumers are ex- pected to spend around $122 million on collagen products.The largest component will be cosmetic collagen, but a sub- stantial portion of the emerging market will be collagen-based nutraceuticals for bones and joints.Patients with OA consumesupplements along with OTC products [ 11]; they hope for readily available, new, and innovative nutraceuticals.Thereis an opportunity to develop combination nutraceuticals incor-porating collagen ultra-hydrolyzates since supplements re- main very appealing for many patients dissatisfied with cur- rent conventional drugs.
Conclusions A growing body of work has accumulated to provide a scien-tific rationale for the use of oral collagen hydrolyzates to treatpatients with OA. However, evidence for their clinical effica- cy is lacking and mechanistic and targeted clinical research is required to determine if and how collagen hydrolyzates mayhelp to improve joint health [ 86,87].We need to determine which OA phenotypes and subpopulations are the most appro-priate for demonstrating the potential benefits of oral collagensupplements.Collagen hydrolyzates have demonstrated some evidence of efficacy in several small scale clinical trials, but more research is needed.Collagen hydrolyzates are likely tohave a much greater impact in patients with early OA com- pared to patients with advanced OA.Also, collagen hydroly- zates have the potential for use in a healthy population withoutOA, as a preventive and prophylactic measure.
Collagen hy- drolyzates are considered an attractive nutritional supplement for preventing bone and joint degeneration in early stages ofOA, but their ability to treat and reverse advanced joint disease remains highly speculative. Novel and innovative research continues to be published on collagen hydrolyzates and linkswith the microbiome, but more work is needed.We advocate new interdisciplinary collaborative initiatives, at the academic and industrial level, to develop new products and criticallyevaluate the impact of collagen-based nutraceutical supple- ments for patients with OA and related osteoarticular disorders.
