These patients often exhibit different types ofseizures and variable comorbidities. Recently, the PNPOgene has also been implicated in epilepsy in adults.It is unclear how thesephenotypic variations are linked to specific PNPOalleles and to what degree diet can modify their expression.Using CRISPR-Cas9,wegeneratedfourknock-in Drosophila alleles, h WT,hR116Q,hD33V, andhR95H, in which the endogenous Drosophila PNPO was re- placedbywild-typehuman PNPOcomplementaryDNA(cDNA)and three epilepsy-associated variants.We found that these knock-in flies exhibited a wide range of phenotypes, including devel-opmental impairments, abnormal locomotor activities, sponta-neous seizures, and shortened life span.These phenotypes areallele dependent, varying with the known biochemical severity ofthese mutations and our characterized molecular defects.
We alsoshowed that diet treatments further diversified the phenotypesamongalleles,andPLPsupplementationatlarvalandadultstagesprevented developmental impairments and seizures in adult flies, respectively. Furthermore, we found that h R95Hhad a significant dominant-negative effect, rendering heterozygous flies suscep-tible to seizures and premature death.Together, these resultsprovidebiologicalbasesforthevariousphenotypesresultingfrommultifunction of PNPO, specific molecular and/or genetic proper- ties of each PNPOvariant, and differential allele–diet interactions.gene–environment interaction | phenotypic variation | pyridox(am)ine 5′-phosphate oxidase | vitamin B6 | sugarlethal Pyridox(am)ine 5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO; Enzyme Com- mission Number 1.4.3.5) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of vitamin B6 (VB6) (1).Mutations in PNPO cancause neonatal epileptic encephalopathy, a devastating diseasethat usually leads to death if untreated (2).
Recently, PNPOmutations have also been reported in patients with infantile spasms and early-onset epilepsy (3–6), and the PNPO gene has been recognized as 1 of the 16 epilepsy genes involved in geneticgeneralized epilepsy in adults (7). The increasingly recognizedimpact of PNPO in epilepsy raises the question of how PNPO variants are implicated in different types of epilepsy and ages ofseizure onset.VB6 comprises pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, and their corresponding phosphorylated forms (i.e., pyridoxine5 ′-phosphate, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate, and pyridoxal 5′- phosphate [PLP]).Among them, PLP is the only active form,which is a cofactor for more than 140 enzymes, including thoserequired for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine,serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (8).Unlike plants, bacteria, and fungi, humans and other animals cannotsynthesize VB6 de novo, instead relying on dietary VB6, whichis converted to PLP by PNPO (1).
The amino acid sequenceand structure of PNPO are conserved well from Escherichia colito humans (9–11). In mammals, PNPO is highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and brain (12).The functional PNPOprotein is a homodimer, and it binds to two molecules of ﬂavinmononucleotide (FMN) as cofactors (13–15).T o date, more than 30 PNPO variants have been identiﬁed in neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and other epilepsy patientssince the ﬁrst report in 2005 (2, 16, 17).Biochemical studiesshow that different variants reduce the PNPO enzymatic activityto different levels, ranging from 0 to 83% (2, 3, 18, 19).Such Significance Bothgeneticandenvironmentalfactorscontributetoepilepsy.Understanding their contributions and interactions helps dis-ease management.However, it is often challenging to studygene–environment interaction in humans due to their het-erogeneous genetic background and less controllable envi-ronmental factors.

Whilethese in vitro studies show clear evidence that different PNPOmutations affect enzymatic activity to varying degrees, they donot explain the variation in seizure types, seizure onsets, andcomorbidities manifested by PNPO-deﬁcient patients carryingthe same mutation (3, 17). Furthermore, PNPO variants have never been studied in vivo for their molecular or functional de-fects.It remains unknown whether they can also indirectly affectthe gene’s function at transcriptional and/or translational levels.These molecular characterizations are crucial for understandingthe phenotypic variation from a molecular perspective.Lastly,the dietary contribution to the phenotypic variations has not beensystematically examined.Therefore, there is a need to develop invivo systems to better understand individual PNPO variants, their potential contributions to phenotypic variations, and the effect ofdiet on the phenotype expression associated with each variant.
Drosophila melanogaster has been proven to be a valuable model system to study human diseases, including epilepsy (22–26). Our previous studies have also demonstrated that the PNPO gene is functionally conserved between humans and ﬂies; similar to humans, PNPO deﬁciency in Drosophila also leads to seizures and premature death (27).Here, we generated four Drosophila knock-in (KI) strains carrying either wild-type (WT) human pyridox(am)ine 5 ′-phosphate oxidase ( hPNPO ) allele ( hWT)o r one of three hPNPO epilepsy-associated alleles hR116Q,hD33V,a n d hR95H.We examined KI ﬂies at the molecular, circuitry, behav- ioral, and organismal levels.In addition to the reported impairedenzymatic activity, we found that each mutant variant conferred a speciﬁc molecular effect; h D33Vdecreased messenger RNA (mRNA) level, hR95Hreduced protein stability, and hR116Qaltered the protein localization of PNPO in the brain.
Furthermore, we observed a wide range of phenotypes in KI ﬂies, includingdevelopmental impairments, behavioral hyper- or hypoactivity,spontaneous seizure discharges or abnormal ﬁring patterns, and shortened life span. The phenotypic variation is associated with the known biochemical severity of these mutations and our char-acterized molecular defects.We also showed that diet treatmentsfurther diversiﬁed the phenotypes among alleles, and PLP sup-plementation at larval or adult stages prevented developmentalimpairments and seizures in adult ﬂies, respectively.Finally, we found that h R95Hhad a signiﬁcant dominant-negative effect, and heterozygous ﬂies were prone to seizures upon electroconvulsivestimulation and showed increased lethality on the VB6-devoiddiet.Results Generation of KI Drosophila Strains Carrying h PNPO Variants Identi- ﬁed from Epilepsy Patients.hPNPO spans∼8 kbp in the genome and has 17 splice variants (28).
The most ubiquitously expressedvariant has seven exons and encodes a 261-amino acid protein(Fig. 1 A).In PNPO, two domains are required for the enzymatic activity; one is the oxidase domain located in the middle region,and the other one is the dimerization domain located at the Cterminus.Functional PNPO is a dimer; the monomer has noenzymatic activities (14).The Drosophila PNPO gene ( sugarlethal [sgll]) encodes two protein products using alternative transcriptional starts; theyshare the C terminus and differ at the N terminus, with one formcontaining nine extra amino acids (Fig.1 BandC) (10).The protein sequence of Drosophila PNPOs shares ∼45% identity and 75% similarity with hPNPO (Fig.1 C).Functionally, PNPO deﬁciency in ﬂies causes seizures and premature death as it doesin humans (16, 27).Both seizures and premature death can berescued by ubiquitous expression of WT hPNPO (16, 27), suggest- ing that the molecules and signaling pathways underlying PNPO Fig.

Although these mu- tations tend to spread across the hPNPO gene/protein, more variants are associated with oxidase and dimerization domains. Here, we generated four KI Drosophila alleles using CRISPR- Cas9, in which the Drosophila PNPO gene, sgll(10), was re- placed by hPNPO cDNAs (Fig.1 B).These four KI alleles were 2o f1 2 PNAS https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2115524119Chi et al.Drosophila carrying epilepsy-associated variants in the vitamin B6 metabolism gene PNPOdisplay allele- and diet-dependent phenotypes GENETICSdesignated as hR116Q,hD33V,hR95H,a n d hWT.The three mutant alleles, hR116Q,hD33V,a n d hR95H, were chosen to represent differ- ent severities of PNPO deﬁciency based on in vitro biochemical studies of their corresponding mutant proteins (hR116Q,hD33V, and hR95Hhereafter).The residual enzymatic activities of hR116Q, hD33V, and hR95Hare∼80, 40, and 20% of hWT, respectively (3, 18).The mutation in each allele was conﬁrmed by Sangersequencing (Fig.1 D).
All KI alleles were initially balanced over aTM6B, Hu, Tb chromosome ( TM6B hereafter) to circumvent potential homozygous lethality. Distinct Molecular Alterations Linked to Different hPNPO Epilepsy- Associated Variants.Other than reducing the enzymatic activity (2, 3, 18, 19), little is known about the molecular characteristicsofhPNPO variants.Thus, after establishing the KI lines, we ﬁrst studied whether these epilepsy-associated variants couldaffect hPNPO expression and localization using homozygous ﬂies ( SI Appendix , Figs.S1 and S2 ).The h R95Hallele was not included initially because hR95Hhomozygotes were lethal (see below).T o include all four KI alleles, we further crossed KI lines with w1118to generate KI/ sgll+ﬂies and performed western blotting and qRT-PCR using adult heads.We conﬁrmed thatthe antibody for hPNPO did not recognize Drosophila PNPO (SI Appendix , Fig.S3 ).
Results from western blot demonstrated that the R116Q mutation did not change the hPNPO protein level, whereas D33V and R95H signiﬁcantly reduced it (Fig. 2 A andBandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 AandB).Interestingly, multiple bands instead of a single band appeared on the blot.Themolecular nature of these bands is unclear.One possibilityis that given only that the sgll-RB form was replaced in the KI allele (Fig.1 B), a chimeric hPNPO protein could also be expressed, which contains the nine extra amino acids from sgll-RA in the front of the hPNPO protein.It is also possible that themultiple bands were due to protein modiﬁcations or proteolysis,as suggested in a previous study (14).The reduced hPNPO protein level associated with D33V or R95H mutations could be due to changes at the transcriptionalor translational level.We, therefore, examined the mRNA levelofhPNPO in each genotype using qRT-PCR.
T wo pairs of primers that speciﬁcally targeted the N- or C-terminal regions of hPNPO cDNA were used. Results from both primer pairs showed thatD33V but not R95H led to a reduced mRNA level (Fig.2 C andSI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 C).The reduced mRNA level associated with D33V was observed in ﬂies reared on both normal andsugar-only diets ( SI Appendix , Fig.S2 ), suggesting that it is likely Fig.2.Molecular characterization of each KI allele.( A) Western blot of hPNPO in an adult head homogenate from each KI/ sgll+line.n= 4 per genotype.In each batch, one sample from w1118flies ( sgll+/sgll+) is loaded as the antibody control.Tubulin is the loading control.The arrow indicates a band also seen in w1118flies, which most likely is a nonspecific band ( SI Appendix , Fig.S3).M.W.: molecular weight.( B) Quantification of hPNPO in A(the top band).Error bars represent mean ±SEM.The two-tailed Student’s ttest with Bonferroni’s correction compared with hWT/sgll+was used.* P< 0.05; ** P< 0.01.

Next, we examined the localization of hPNPO protein in the adult brain using immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-hPNPO antibody. Anti-Bruchpilot (Brp) antibody was used to visualize synapse-rich neuropils (31).We found that hWTwas ubiquitously expressed in the brain with the strongest stainingin the cell body rind, which comprises neuronal cell bodies andcertain types of glial cells (Fig.2 DandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 A) (32).The antibody is presumably speciﬁc to hPNPO as very faint staining was observed in w 1118control ﬂies ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 5 ).There was little overlap between Brp and hPNPO staining, sug- gesting that hWTis not enriched in the terminal structures.Con- sistently, no hPNPO staining was observed in ﬁber bundles, such as anterior optic tract, inferior ﬁber system, and medial anten- nal lobe (AL) tract ( SI Appendix , Fig.S4 A).Moderate hPNPO staining was also shown in areas surrounding neuropils.Oneprominent region is the area surrounding the AL (Fig.2 D).
The ALs are the primary centers for olfactory processing in ﬂies, and they are organized into individual glomeruli. Each glomeruluscontains synapses formed by three types of neurons: olfactoryreceptor neurons (ORNs), local interneurons (LNs), and projec- tion neurons (PNs).While the cell bodies of ORNs are far away from ALs, the cell bodies of LNs and PNs surround ALs.ThePNs extend their dendrites to glomeruli and receive excitatoryinput from ORNs to relay olfactory information to higher brain centers, such as the mushroom body calyx and the lateral horn of the protocerebrum; the LNs are interneurons, and most of themare GABAergic (33).Subcellularly, hPNPO mainly stayed inthe cell bodies of surrounding neurons ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 B).
Furthermore, the staining of hPNPO did not overlap with DAPI, a nucleus marker, suggesting that hPNPO is mainly cytosolic.Notably, compared with the strong staining of hPNPO in cellbodies, faint hPNPO staining was also observed in the glomeruli region. However, it does not seem to overlap with the Brp staining ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 B).Thus, the hPNPO staining in the glomerulus region was most likely from the dendrites of LNsor glial cells.A similar hPNPO staining pattern was observed in h D33Vbrains (Fig.2 D), suggesting that D33V does not affect the protein localization in the brain.In striking contrast, strong terminal staining for hPNPO was detected in hR116Qbrains (Fig.2 Dand E).The increased staining appeared to occur in all terminal structures in the brain, with the most dramatic change in the AL (SI Appendix ,F i g .S 6 ).Since the hPNPO protein level in hR116Qis comparable with that in hWT(Fig.
2 AandB), we speculate that the increased terminal staining is most likely caused by altered localization of hR116Qin the brain, at least in some cell types. T aken together, molecular characterization of hPNPO variants in KI ﬂies demonstrates that in addition to reducing the enzy- matic activity as shown in previous studies (2, 3, 18, 19), hPNPO variants can also affect the gene’s function through altering themRNA and/or protein level or the protein localization in thebrain.Distinct Developmental Effects Associated with Different hPNPO Variants.All balanced KI lines were viable and fertile.However, no homozygous KI adult ﬂies were observed from hR95H/TM6B breeding bottles.T o rule out the contribution of any off- target mutations, the KI line was backcrossed to w1118for ﬁve generations.No homozygous hR95Hpupae or adult ﬂies were observed after backcross, suggesting that the lethality was most likely due to the R95H mutation in hPNPO.
T o systematically study the effects of the R95H mutation as well as the two other mutations on development, we self-crossedeach KI line and examined the number of homozygous KI ﬂies in the F1 generation. The ratio of KI homozygous ﬂies in all ﬂies (homozygosity ratio) was further calculated.Consistent with our initial observations, no hR95Hhomozygotes were observed(Fig.3 A).A signiﬁcantly decreased homozygosity ratio was also found from hD33Vself-breeding.By contrast, the homozygosity ratio in hR116Qwas comparable with that in hWT.Thus, these three mutant alleles have differential effects on development.This conclusion was corroborated by complementation tests(SI Appendix , Fig.S7 ).Allele-Dependent Diet Modiﬁcations of Life Span in KI Flies.PLP is involved in a variety of biological processes (8), yet the potentialcumulative effect of chronic PNPO deﬁciency has never been studied.We examined whether hR116QandhD33Vcould affect the survival of adult ﬂies on the normal diet.
Survival data showed thathR116Qhad a slightly shortened life span compared with hWT (median: 71 vs. 74 d for hR116QandhWT, respectively; P< 0.01) (Fig.3 B).In comparison, the life span of hD33Vwas much shorter (median: 56 d; P< 0.001).The lethality of hR116QandhD33V ﬂies correlated well with the residual enzymatic activity of hR116Q andhD33Vmeasured by in vitro studies (3, 18).T ogether, these studies demonstrate that even mild PNPO deﬁciency can havea long-term deleterious consequence, even in the presence ofdietary VB6.We have previously reported that PNPO-deﬁcient ﬂies ( sgll 95) are short lived on the sugar-only diet (i.e., VB6-devoid diet) (27), suggesting that the sugar-only diet is useful for exacerbating PNPO deﬁciency.We thus generated homozygous (two same KI alleles), heterozygous (one hWTallele and one mutant allele), and transheterozygous (two mutant alleles) ﬂies using four KI alleles and examined their survival on sugar.
We found that the mostdramatic lethal phenotype among these nine genotypes was from hD33V/hR95Hﬂies (Fig. 3 C), of which ∼75% died by day 11.The Fig.3.Developmental and survival phenotypes of KI flies from various genotypes.( A) Generation of homozygous flies from each KI line.The χ2 test of homogeneity compared with hWT/TM6B(the gray line) is shown.(B) Survival of homozygous flies on the normal diet.n= 63 to 102, log-rank test compared with hWT.(C) Survival of flies from various genotypes on the sugar-only diet.n= 102 to 218, log-rank test compared with hWT.Survival of each genotype on day 11 is also shown in the lollipop plot in Right.n.s., P> 0.05.* P< 0.05; ** P< 0.01; *** P< 0.001.4o f1 2 PNAS https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2115524119Chi et al.
Drosophila carrying epilepsy-associated variants in the vitamin B6 metabolism gene PNPOdisplay allele- and diet-dependent phenotypes GENETICSsigniﬁcant lethality in hD33V/hR95Hﬂies was not surprising since based on in vitro residual enzymatic activity studies, hD33V/hR95H has the most severe PNPO deﬁciency. We also observed lethality from hR116Q/hR95HandhWT/hR95Hﬂies; about 15% of them died by day 11 (Fig.3 C), suggesting that hR95His indeed the most severe allele among all three mutant alleles.The fact that hWT/hR95H showed lethality suggests that hR95Hmay cause haploinsufﬁciency or have a dominant-negative effect, which is unexpected because PNPO has been considered as autosomal recessive in heritance (https://omim.org ).These two possibilities were further studied (see below).Overall, these studies demonstrate that both PNPO variants and dietary conditions can affect survival of KI ﬂies.Allele-Dependent Diet Modiﬁcations of Locomotor Behaviors of KI Flies.
The hR116Qand hD33Vhomozygous ﬂies did not exhibit noticeable behavioral deﬁcits when reared on the normal diet(the cornmeal–yeast–molasses [CYM] media). Consistent withthis observation, mutant homozygous ﬂies traveled a similar total distance in an open-ﬁeld arena, with comparable speed, per-centage of active time, and speed correlation coefﬁcient (SCC) compared with h WThomozygotes ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 8 A–E).However, when eclosed ﬂies were reared on sugar for 4 to 6 d( F i g .4 A),hR116Qhomozygotes exhibited hyperactivity; they traveled farther than hWTand had an increased average speed (Fig.4 B–E).The increased average speed and total traveled distance were not observed in hD33Vhomozygotes in the same breeding and testing conditions (Fig.4 B–E).
Interestingly, when ﬁles were bred on the other standard diet, the Frankel &Brosseau’s (FB) media, in which yeast extract and nonfat dry milkwere used to replace the dried yeast in the CYM media (34, 35), both h R116QandhD33Vhomozygous ﬂies exhibited hyperactivity (SI Appendix , Fig. S8 F–J).The difference was maintained when eclosed ﬂies were further reared on sugar for 4 to 6 d (Fig.4 F–J).Therefore, diet plays a signiﬁcant role in modifying the behaviors ofhR116QandhD33Vhomozygous ﬂies.Fig.4.Behavioral analyses of KI flies in an open-field arena.( AandF) Breeding and testing conditions and representative tracks from each genotype.Flies were eclosed (E) on either the CYM or FB diet and then, transferred to the sugar-only diet (4% Suc).( B–E) Total distance traveled, percentage of active time, average speed, and SCC ( Materials and Methods has calculation details), respectively, of flies from various genotypes generated and tested in A.n=5 0t o 75 flies.

The hD33V/hR95Hﬂies, however, were less active in both testing con- ditions, and some even exhibited tortious walking paths whenreared on sugar (a representative track is in Fig. 4 A) and con- sequently, had low SCCs.The average SCC of h D33V/hR95Hﬂies is, however, comparable with that of hWT(Fig.4 E).The fact that the hD33V/hR95Hﬂies exhibited behavioral deﬁcits even on the normal diet suggests that their residual PNPO enzymatic activityis insufﬁcient to convert dietary VB6 to PLP to maintain normalbehaviors.When bred on the FB media, h WT/hR95Hﬂies were more ac- tive than hWThomozygotes in both sugar-only and FB testing conditions (Fig.4 G–J andSI Appendix ,F i g .S 8 G–J), which re- sembles hR116QandhD33Vhomozygotes in the same conditions.The different behaviors of hWT/hR95H,hR116Q,o rhD33Vﬂies on different media are likely due to the mild PNPO deﬁciency inthem and its interaction with different diets.
Consistent with thisnotion, h D33V/hR95Hﬂies, which have much more severe PNPO deﬁciency than them, exhibited hypoactivity and tortious walkingpaths on both media (Fig. 4 and Movie S1 ).T aken together, behavioral analyses of KI ﬂies on different dietary conditions demonstrate that diet can potentially interactwith PNPO deﬁciency to modify the locomotor behaviors of KIﬂies, and the effect of diet–allele interactions becomes prominentwhen ﬂies have mild PNPO deﬁciency.Spontaneous Seizures in KI Flies with Severe PNPO Deﬁciency.The spectrum of behavioral phenotypes associated with KI linesprompted us to examine motor unit activity patterns and identifyspontaneous seizure-associated spike discharges in the respectivelines.We utilized a tethered ﬂy preparation (Fig.5 A) to monitor dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM) activity in intact, behavingﬂies.
During ﬂight, these muscles power the “down stroke” ofthe wing, and the isometric nature of their contractions facilitatesprolonged recordings with minimal muscle damage. Importantly,the innervating DLM motor neuron (DLMn) serves as an outputfor several motor programs (e.g., ﬂight, courtship song, andgrooming activity) (26, 36–38).Several studies have utilizedaberrant spiking in this motor unit to monitor spontaneous (39)and evoked (40) seizure activity, including our previous analyses of the original sgll 95mutant (27).We found that hWThomozygotes reared on sugar displayed occasional grooming-related spiking(Fig.5 AandMovie S2 ), largely consistent with activity patterns in other control ﬂies (41).In the h R116QandhD33Vmutants reared on the same diet, we mostly observed similar grooming-associatedactivity patterns, with a marginal increase in the average ﬁring rate in h D33Vﬂies compared with hWTcontrols (Fig.5 B).
The increased average ﬁring in hD33Vﬂies was due to a small subset ofhD33Vindividuals (3 of 12) showing a peculiar and highly stereotypic pattern of repeated DLM spike bursts (Fig. 5 Aand Movie S2 ).This bursting did not have clear behavioral correlates and was distinct from previously reported spontaneous seizure activity in sgll95mutants (27).In contrast to the relatively mild phenotypes displayed by homozygous KI lines, we found ongoing spontaneous seizure activity in hD33V/hR95Htransheterozygotes, manifesting as high- frequency spike burst discharges (Fig.5 Aand Movie S2 ), with overall DLM ﬁring rates for hD33V/hR95Hsubstantially greater than hWTorhWT/hR95Hﬂies reared on the same media (Fig.5 B).T o determine if this aberrant spiking activity originated from theCNS or endogenously from the motor unit, we blocked centralexcitatory neurotransmission and monitored the effect on spiking activity.
In ﬂies, acetylcholine is the primary excitatory neuro-transmitter in the CNS (42), while glutamate is the transmitter atthe neuromuscular junction (43). We applied the nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor blocker mecamylamine using a rapid systemicinjection protocol (41) and found that the spike discharges in h D33V/hR95Hwere abolished (Fig.5 C), indicating that aberrant CNS activity drove the seizure-associated motor unit dischargesin these ﬂies.During seizure-associated discharges in h D33V/hR95Hmutants, bursts in hD33V, and grooming-associated activity in hWTand other KI ﬂies, the DLM spiking intervals were highly variable,with instantaneous ﬁring rates (deﬁned as the reciprocal of the interspike interval [ISI –1]) ranging from ∼1 Hz to nearly 50 Hz.However, these activity patterns could be readily distinguishedand were remarkably characteristic within mutant ﬂies.
T o quan-titatively delineate seizure-associated activity in KI ﬂies fromgrooming-related spiking, we employed a nonlinear dynamicalsystems approach we had previously used to describe ﬁring pat- terns in the sgll 95mutants and other hyperexcitable ﬂies (Fig. 5 D) (27, 41).For each spike in the recording, we plotted the spike’s instantaneous ﬁring rate (ISI–1) against the instantaneous coef- ﬁcient of variation (CV 2)(Materials and Methods has the def- inition).High CV 2values indicate irregular ﬁring, while low values indicate rhythmic activity.Previously, we have shown that seizure-related bursting in sgll95mutants corresponded to a self- similar “looping” trajectory in the phase–space analysis, whilegrooming activity displayed a distinctive trajectory limited to high CV 2values (>0.5).Based on the ISI–1–CV 2plots (representa- tive trajectories are shown in Fig.
5 D), the orbiting trajectories ofhD33Vbursting and hD33V/hR95Hspike discharges were readily distinguished from grooming-related behavior and from one an- other. Furthermore, the trajectories of hD33V/hR95Hﬁring were qualitatively similar to spontaneous seizures in sgll95mutants (27), suggesting a shared neural mechanism underlying the aber-rant activity.Reduced GABAergic Function in KI Mutant Flies.Next, we asked what neurotransmission system(s) was responsible for the spon-taneous seizures in hPNPO KI mutants.T o provide an initial glance at excitatory cholinergic signaling, we examined proper-ties of the giant ﬁber (GF) jump-and-ﬂight escape pathway, adescending circuit with identiﬁed neurons as well as cholinergic,glutamatergic, and electrical synapses (44).Mutations disrupt-ing neuronal excitability (45), cholinergic transmission (46), andgap junctions (47) lead to profound disruptions in GF pathway performance.
In h WTﬂies, direct stimulation of the GF neuron leads to a DLM spike with a stereotypic latency of 1.41 ±0.04 ms (Fig. 5 E), similar to previously reported WT and control strains (i.e., “short latency” responses) (45, 48).We found that the GF latencies in hR116QandhD33Vwere comparable with hWT (1.42±0.08 and 1.46 ±0.04 ms, respectively) (Fig.5 E).Further- more, using a repetitive stimulation protocol across a wide range of frequencies (20 to 200 Hz), we found that hR116QandhD33V were able to follow high-frequency stimulation to a similar degree ashWT(Fig.5 F).T aken together, these observations suggest that the function of both excitatory cholinergic transmission andelectrical synapses is largely maintained in the KI mutants.We further asked whether the PNPO mutations led to changes in GABAergic signaling given that PLP , the product of PNPO, isrequired for the GABA synthesis.
In WT ﬂies, injection of thenoncompetitive GABA Areceptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX; concentration >50 μM) induces a stereotypic sequence of ﬂight- like rhythmic DLM spiking ( ∼10 Hz) followed by spike bursts exceeding 100 Hz (41, 49). We reasoned that if GABAergictone was reduced in KI ﬂies, injection of PTX at subthreshold 6o f1 2 PNAS https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2115524119Chi et al.Drosophila carrying epilepsy-associated variants in the vitamin B6 metabolism gene PNPOdisplay allele- and diet-dependent phenotypes GENETICS Fig.5.Electrophysiological correlates of seizures-related activity in KI flies.( A) Tethered fly preparation ( Materials and Methods has details) and representative traces of spontaneous activity in DLM flight muscle spiking flies from each genotype reared on the sugar-only diet.Firing in hWT,hR116Q, andhD33V(the trace below the fly image) and in hWT/hR95His related to grooming behavior.

concentrations would trigger abnormal DLM spiking activity inhR116Qand hD33Vbut not hWT. Indeed, following injection of 30 μM PTX, none (zero of ﬁve) of the hWTﬂies displayed abnormal DLM spiking (Fig.5 GandH).In contrast, two of ﬁvehR116Qand ﬁve of six hD33Vﬂies displayed continuous DLM spiking following PTX injection (Fig.5 GandH).In fact, we observed burst ﬁring in hD33Vindividuals reminiscent of the spontaneous seizure phenotype in hD33V/hR95Hﬂies, as revealed by similar looping trajectories in the ISI–1–CV 2plots (Fig.5 I).These experimental ﬁndings suggest thar a reduced GABAergictone, perhaps arising from disrupted GABA synthesis, underlies the excitability and behavioral phenotypes seen in the h R116Qand hD33Vﬂies.PLP Is Required for Both Development and Function of Adult Brain.NohR95Hhomozygous ﬂies were generated on the normal diet(Fig.3 A), suggesting that the PNPO activity in these homozy- gotes is insufﬁcient to convert dietary VB6 to PLP to supportdevelopment.
Thus, PLP supplementation should rescue thedevelopmental impairment. We further asked whether there isa basal level requirement for PLP to support development.T oanswer the question, we supplemented breeders with varyingdoses of PLP , ranging from 0 to 400 μg/mL.We found a dose-dependent rescue associated with PLP supplementation.Speciﬁcally, we observed a complete rescue with 40 or 400 μg/mL of PLP , a partial rescue with 4 μg/mL, and no rescue with doses below 4 μg/mL (Fig.6 A).T o examine whether PLP was also indispensable for adult ﬂies, we maintained h R95Hhomozygous ﬂies (developed with PLP supplementation; 400 μg/mL) on sugar with or without continued PLP supplementation (400 μg/mL).With PLP supplementation hR95Hmutants survived for several weeks (Fig.6 B) (median life Chi et al.Drosophila carrying epilepsy-associated variants in the vitamin B6 metabolism gene PNPOdisplay allele- and diet-dependent phenotypesPNAS 7o f1 2 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2115524119 Fig.

Compared with hR95Hhomozygotes without PLP supplementation, hR95Hhomozygotes with PLP sup- plementation for 2 d showed signiﬁcantly improved levels intotal distance traveled, percentage of active time, average speed, and SCC (Fig. 6 D–G), demonstrating that PLP deﬁciency is responsible for the low behavioral performance of h R95Hhomozy- gous ﬂies.The improvement of the behavioral performance de- clined with age, which correlates well with the increased lethality (Fig.6 B).Consistent with our previous ﬁndings that PNPO deﬁciency leads to increased spontaneous ﬁring and seizure discharges (27) (Fig.5), hR95Hhomozygotes on sugar also exhibited clear spontaneous seizure discharges in the tethered ﬂy preparation (Fig.6 Hand Movie S4 ).Remarkably, these seizure-associated discharges were completely suppressed by PLP supplementation, as demonstrated by greatly reduced median ﬁring rate (Fig.
6 I) (1.9 to 0.5 Hz for ﬂies on sugar and sugar only supplementedwith PLP , respectively) and the alteration from burst-associated trajectories to grooming-associated patterns in the ISI –1–CV 2 plots (Fig. 6 J).T aken together, results from stage-speciﬁc PLP supplemen- tation demonstrate that PLP is required for both development and normal brain function in adult ﬂies.Notably, PLP deﬁciency in larval stages will lead to a dose-dependent developmentalimpairment; the higher the level of a deﬁciency, the more severe the impairment.hWT/hR95HFlies Are Susceptible to Electroconvulsive Seizures Due to a Dominant-Negative Effect of hR95H.We observed an unexpected lethality from hWT/hR95Hﬂies when reared on sugar (Fig.3 C).T o ascertain whether the lethality was due to haploinsufﬁciency or a dominant-negative effect of hR95Hon hWT, we compared the survival rate of hWT/hR95Hﬂies with that of hWT/Dfﬂies in which thesgllgene is deleted in the Dfline.
Since there is only one hPNPO allele in hWT/Dfﬂies, we reasoned that if the lethality was due to haploinsufﬁciency, survival of hWT/hR95Hﬂies would be similar to hWT/Df. If the lethality was due to a dominant-negative effect, hWT/hR95Hwould exhibit worse survival than hWT/Dfﬂies.As shown in Fig.7 A, the median survival rates are 19 and 27 d for hWT/hR95HandhWT/Df, respectively ( P< 0.001), demonstrating a dominant-negative effect of hR95H.Functional PNPO is a dimerized protein (Fig.7 B) (14), so the dominant-negative effect of hR95Hon hWTwas likely mediated through the formation of a heterodimer between them.How- ever, a reduced hPNPO protein level was observed in hR95H/sgll+ ﬂies (Fig.2 A), suggesting that the monomer or homodimer of hR95His not stable.How could the dominant-negative effect be possible if hR95His unstable?One possibility was that hR95H was stabilized by forming a heterodimer with hWTinhWT/hR95H ﬂies.
The stabilization was not observed in hR95H/sgll+ﬂies be- cause hR95His less likely to form a heterodimer with SGLL due to their differences in the length and amino acid sequences (Fig. 1 C).If hR95Hwas indeed stabilized in hWT/hR95Hﬂies, we would expect the hPNPO protein level in hWT/hR95Hto be twice as high as that in hWT/Dfsince there are two alleles of hPNPO inhWT/hR95Hand one in hWT/Df.That is exactly what we observed from western blots (Fig.7 CandD).Thus, the dominant-negative effect of hR95His likely mediated through forming a heterodimer with hWT.8o f1 2 PNAS https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2115524119Chi et al.Drosophila carrying epilepsy-associated variants in the vitamin B6 metabolism gene PNPOdisplay allele- and diet-dependent phenotypes GENETICS Fig.7.ThehR95Hallele has a dominant-negative effect on the hWTallele.(A) Survival of hWT/hR95Hand hWT/Dfflies on the sugar-only diet.n= 133 to 136.The log-rank test was used.*** P< 0.001.

However, these ﬂies did not show spontaneous seizures (Fig. 5 AandB).T o determine whether hWT/hR95Hﬂies were prone to seizures, we stimulated them with high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS).HFSacross the brain can induce stereotypic electroconvulsiveseizure (ECS) discharges in ﬂies (Fig.7 Eand Movie S5 ) (40, 50).Compared with control ﬂies, seizure-prone ﬂies usually require lower stimulation intensities to induce seizures (25, 26).Many seizure-prone mutants have thus been identiﬁed andcharacterized (26, 37, 38, 40, 50, 51).By applying a range from 30 to 80 V of HFS intensities to h WT/hR95Hheterozygous and hWT homozygous ﬂies, we found a substantial reduction in the ECS stimulation threshold in hWT/hR95Hcompared with hWT.When hWT/hR95HandhWTﬂies were stimulated with a low voltage (30 V), seizures were already induced in 50% of hWT/hR95Hﬂies, while no seizures were observed in hWT(Fig.7 F).
The increased sensitivity inhWT/hR95Hwas maintained when the stimulation intensity was gradually increased. At 80 V , essentially all hWT/hR95Hﬂies showed ECS discharges, while only about 60% of hWTwere affected.Thus, the dominant-negative effect of hR95Hconfers the susceptibility of hWT/hR95Hﬂies to HFS-induced seizures.Discussion Studying metabolic genes presents unique opportunities to uncover the contribution of gene–environment interactions tohuman health conditions and can offer potential treatmentoptions for diseases.Y et, it is challenging to study mutationsof such genes in humans since they often lead to lethality during development or rare diseases due to the functional essentialityof metabolic genes.Here, we generated a series of KI Drosophila models carrying hPNPO variants and examined these epilepsy- associated variants at molecular, circuitry, behavioral, andorganismal levels.
This genetically tractable model system andwell-controlled dietary conditions have enabled the functionaland molecular characterization of three epilepsy-associatedPNPO alleles with vastly different phenotypes. Our results reveal thatPNPO has multiple biological functions; that different PNPO variants have distinct molecular properties; and that individualPNPO mutations, diet, and allele–diet interactions all contribute to the ﬁnal phenotype expression.Our data demonstrate how the diet’s effect on the phenotype expression depends on PNPO alleles, with more evident outcome in genotypes showing milder deﬁciency of PNPO activity.Forexample, with speciﬁed dietary breeding and testing conditions, h R116Q,hD33V,o rhWT/hR95Hﬂies exhibited readily detectable be- havioral outcomes, whereas hD33V/hR95Hstayed relatively invari- ant (Fig.4 and SI Appendix , Fig.S8 ).Notably, a less variable phenotype is also known for patients carrying severe PNPOmutations.
The seizure onsets in patients with severe PNPOmutations (e.g., R95H) range from hours to weeks comparedwith the wide variation spanning from hours to years in patientswith mild mutations (e.g., R116Q) (16). The less profound effectof diet in KI ﬂies or patients with severe PNPO deﬁciency ispresumably due to the diminished capability of mutant PNPOsin converting dietary VB6 to PLP .On the other hand, although mild PNPO mutants retain a capacity to convert dietary VB6 to PLP to a greater extent andit is less likely for them to cause acute deleterious effects, the fact that h R116Qﬂies exhibited a shortened life span on the normal diet (Fig.3 B) suggests that the deleterious effect of mild PNPO deﬁciency can be cumulative.While R95H and D33V mutationsare rare in the general population, R116Q is relatively common;∼10% are carriers, and 1% are homozygous (52).
Therefore, it will be important to examine whether mild PNPO deﬁciency caused by R116Q can be exacerbated by other genetic and/orenvironmental factors to cause epilepsy or other diseases inhumans. Developmental delay is one common symptom manifested by PNPO-deﬁcient patients (3, 17, 19, 53), raising the question ofwhether speciﬁc developmental impairments lead to seizures.By providing ﬂies with PLP during either the larval or adultstages, we have demonstrated that developmental impairmentsand seizures in adults are dissociable (Fig.6).Our data alsoindicate that prenatal PLP supplementation may be beneﬁcial forthe development of fetuses who carry severe PNPO mutations.A major ﬁnding from this study is the dominant-negative effect of the R95H mutation.Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy caused by PNPO deﬁciency is generally thought to be anautosomal recessive disease (Online Mendelian Inheritance inMan no.610090), implying that PNPO mutant carriers do notshow any overt phenotype.
Indeed, in all reported PNPO deﬁ-ciency cases, 78% are homozygous for a speciﬁc mutation, and21% are compound heterozygotes (16), except for one patientreported to be a heterozygote (3). Y et, in KI ﬂies, we found a readily detectable dominant-negative effect from the h R95Hallele (Fig.7).The dominant-negative effect is presumably associated with heterodimer formation between hR95Hand hWT.Structural studies have shown that amino acid R95 (arginine 95) is requiredfor the cofactor FMN binding (14, 54) and thus, PNPO enzymeactivity (14).An altered FMN binding site may lead to globalconformation changes and hence, a partially or fully inactiveenzyme.It is tempting to predict that mutations that do notimpede dimerization but affect FMN binding can have adominant-negative effect.Therefore, human carriers of such Chi et al.
Drosophila carrying epilepsy-associated variants in the vitamin B6 metabolism gene PNPOdisplay allele- and diet-dependent phenotypesPNAS 9o f1 2 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2115524119 a category of PNPO mutations could be susceptible to epilepsy and related disorders. We ﬁnd a unique pattern of spontaneous DLM burst ﬁrings in some hD33Vﬂies.The individual variability could be due to many factors, including stochastic events in the developmental pro-cesses into adults (Fig.3 A).Notably, distinct electroencephalo- gram (EEG) patterns have been reported in patients carrying theD33V mutation, who often exhibit a unique pattern of tempo- ral sharp waves or multifocal sharp waves instead of the burst suppression in the majority of PNPO-deﬁcient patients (55).Themolecular and neural mechanisms associated with this peculiarmutation underlying unique ﬁring or EEG pattern remain to beelucidated in both Drosophila and humans.
The amino acid D33 (aspartate 33) is located in the N terminus of the PNPO protein,and the N terminus of PNPO is often not retained in crystalsamples (Fig. 7 B) (14); thus, it is often challenging to examine D33V in structural studies.Our molecular studies on h D33VKI ﬂies show a decrease in the mRNA level and consequently, theprotein level of PNPO (Fig.2 A–C ).However, it seems unlikely that the decreased PNPO protein level is a major determining factor for the distinct ﬁring in h D33Vﬂies since a decreased PNPO protein level was also observed in hR95Hﬂies (Fig.2 A), which exhibit only regular seizure discharges (Fig.6 H–J).It is worth noting that hR95Hﬂies have a higher level of protein decrease and a greater level of enzymatic activity loss than hD33Vﬂies; thus, there is a possibility that ﬁring patterns are associated with thedegree of PNPO deﬁciency.
Future studies should investigatewhether the D33V mutant protein alters neuronal or circuitfunctions in unique ways and whether different extents of PNPOdeﬁciency can affect the various categories of neural function ina severity-dependent manner. The molecular and functional consequences of R116Q have been controversial.R116Q was ﬁrst reported in patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (3), suggesting that it is likelya severe mutation.Later clinical reports show that unlike seizuresin patients carrying other PNPO mutations, seizures in R116Qpatients can occur beyond the neonatal stage (3–5), indicatingthat R116Q is more likely to be a relatively mild mutation.Themolecular consequence of R116Q is also inconclusive.An earlierin vitro study showed that R116Q decreases the enzyme activityto 83% of the WT protein (3).In contrast, two recent studies report decreases to ∼40 and∼1% of the WT activity instead (4, 56).
Our in vivo studies indicate that R116Q is likely a mildmutation (Figs. 3 Aand 5 AandB) and raise the possibility that genetic background or environmental factors can contributeto the above variability in data derived from R116Q patients(3).However, despite mild behavioral phenotype, at the cellularlevel, R116Q profoundly increases the terminal localization ofhPNPO protein in the ﬂy CNS (Fig.2 DandE).Whether this altered localization of h R116Qhas a subtle effect on neuronal function is unknown.The neural mechanisms underlying PNPO deﬁciency-induced seizures remain to be determined.Our previous studies on spike pattern analyses from sgll95andsgllknockdown ﬂies have sug- gested that GABA dysfunction contributes to PNPO deﬁciency- induced seizures (27).In this study, we show that hD33Vﬂies are more vulnerable to GABA Areceptor blockade (Fig.5 G), suggesting that these ﬂies may have a reduced GABAergic tone,presumably arising from decreased GABA synthesis.
In agree- ment with these results, reduced GABA levels have been recently reported in a zebraﬁsh PNPO knockout model (57). There- fore, PNPO deﬁciency probably leads to a reduced GABAergictone, which decreases the ﬁring threshold and/or promotes syn-chronous ﬁring.It should be noted that PLP exhibits considerable functional complexities that can complicate the inference of the neurotrans-mitter system responsible for the seizures and may account forthe variable biochemical measurements among PNPO-deﬁcient patients (17).In addition to being a cofactor and involved in thesynthesis of several neurotransmitters, PLP has other cellularfunctions that can potentially modify the eventual expressionof seizures, including altering immune function and acting asan adenosine triphosphate antagonist at P2 purinoceptors (58).One interesting question is why seizures in PNPO-deﬁcient pa-tients generally do not respond to available antiepileptic drugs,including those targeting GABA signaling (59).
One possibilityis that GABA dysfunction leads to initiation of seizure-proneconditions, which may be functionally compensated by subse-quent remodeling of neuron circuitry and modiﬁed involvementof other neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin.This notion is partially supported by the fact that some PNPO-deﬁcient patients show initial responses to GABA-related drugs(5, 18, 19, 60), although seizures in them ultimately becomedrug resistant. Thus, future investigations into the complexity ofneuronal network dynamics, the role of various PLP-dependentneurotransmitters, and other interactive biological functions ofPLP are required to elucidate the process in generating PNPOdeﬁciency-induced seizures.In summary, our studies uncover a diversity of molecular defects of PNPO variants, reveal the role of the PNPO allele– diet interaction in the phenotype expression, and highlight thecontribution of PNPO deﬁciency to epilepsy in general.
Thesedata provide biological bases for understanding phenotypicvariations in PNPO deﬁciency patients and have signiﬁcantclinical implications in developing treatment strategies. Thesestudies also demonstrate that KI Drosophila models are valuable for systematically analyzing the functional and molecular effectsassociated with each PNPO allele identiﬁed in epilepsy patients.Materials and Methods Generation of KI Strains.Four different KI strains were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (61).The WT hPNPOcDNA was amplified from the human brain cDNA library (TaKaRa; catalog no.637242) (27).Threemutations were introduced separately by mutagenesis.The single guideRNAs, Cas9 mRNAs, and donor constructs were injected into embryos from flies with a genotype of w 1118/FM7a; Bc/CyO; TM3/TM6B, Hu, Tb (http://www.fungene.tech/ )(SI Appendix ).Drosophila Husbandry.Flies were generated on either standard CYM or FB media (34).
