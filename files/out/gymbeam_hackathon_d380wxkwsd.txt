Poor dietary intake with nutritional deficiency and overweight have been described to increase the risk of IBS.The aim of the present study was to compare weight and circulating levels of micronutrients in IBS compared with healthy controls.Design Cross-sectional study.Methods Patients diagnosed with IBS and healthy volunteers were recruited.
Participants had to complete a dietary diary book and the questionnaires Rome IV, IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), and visual analog scale for IBS (VAS- IBS). Weight and height were measured, and blood samples were drawn.C-reactive protein (CRP), cobalamin, folate, iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D were analyzed.Differences were calculated between groups and generalized linear model for regressions was adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR).Results IBS patients ( n = 260) were elder than controls ( n = 50) (44.00 (33.25-56.00) vs.37.85 (30.18–45.48) years; p = 0.012).After adjustment for age, both weight (β: 5.880; 95% CI: 1.433–10.327; p = 0.010, FDR = 0.020) and body mass index (BMI) (β: 2.02; 95% CI: 0.68–3.36; p = 0.003, FDR = 0.012) were higher in patients.Among IBS participants, 48.1% were overweight/obese compared with 26.0% in controls ( p = 0.007).Diarrhea-predominated IBS had highest weight (p < 0.001) and BMI ( p = 0.077).
CRP and cobalamin were higher in patients than controls ( p = 0.010 vs. p = 0.007), whereas folate was highest in controls ( p = 0.001).IBS patients had lower intake of vegetables ( p = 0.026), dairy products ( p = 0.004), and cereals ( p = 0.010) compared with controls.Despite 21.5% of IBS patients were taking vitamin D supplements, 23.65% of them had vitamin D levels below 50 nmol/L, compared with 26.0% observed in the control group ( p = 0.720).Vitamin D levels were lower in overweight than in normal weight IBS patients (60 (48–73) nmol/L vs.65 (53–78) nmol/L, p = 0.022).Vitamin D correlated with cobalamin and folate but correlated inversely with TIBC and BMI.IBS patients had a high degree of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, which were inversely associated with iron levels.Extraintestinal symptoms were associated with increased BMI.Conclusion IBS patients were often overweight or obese, with low vitamin D levels.
High burden of extraintestinal symptoms were associated with overweight and lower iron levels.Overweight and vitamin D deficiency are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome - a cross-sectional study Bodil Roth1 and Bodil Ohlsson1,2* Page 2 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 Introduction The etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown, but several factors such as female sex, dietary habits, psychological factors, gastrointestinal (GI) motil - ity, visceral hypersensitivity, gut-brain axis dysfunction, low-grade intestinal inflammation, impaired epithelial barrier integrity, and gut microbiota alterations have been discussed as risk factors for the disease [ 1, 2]. Comorbidities with depression, anxiety, and pain from other organs are common in IBS [ 3–5].
Food intake is often a trigger to aggravated GI symptoms, and both a starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) and a diet with low levels of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) have been shown to markedly improve GI symptoms, extraintesti - nal symptoms, and psychological well-being [ 6–9]. Patients with IBS/disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) have been found to have a low intake and circu - lating levels of several micronutrients [ 6, 10].This may be explained by poor food habits in IBS with high consump - tion of sugar and processed food [ 8, 11, 12].A history of several restrictive diets, such as the low FODMAPs diet, to control abdominal pain and symptoms may lead to lower intakes of fruits, vegetables, and micronutrients [8, 9, 13].Poor food habits for several years may lead to cognitive dysfunction, mental illness, and several organic conditions [ 14–16].
Both iron and vitamin D deficiency have become worldwide health issues [ 17, 18]. Iron defi - ciency and anemia are well-established causes of chronic fatigue [ 19].Vitamin D deficiency may be involved in the development of central hypersensitivity and trigger both IBS symptoms and impaired psychological well- being [ 20–22], and is associated with many chronic dis - eases [ 23, 24].Overweight and obesity are also growing health issues in the world, leading to several inflamma - tory and endocrine changes which can increase the risk for chronic diseases including IBS [ 25].An association between vitamin D deficiency and overweight/obesity has been described [ 26, 27].Our hypothesis was that overweight and low circulat - ing levels of micronutrients may be of importance for experience of symptoms and psychological well-being in IBS.
The aim of the present study was to examine weight and plasma/serum levels of micronutrients in IBS com - pared to healthy controls and whether these factors were associated with aggravated GI or extraintestinal symp - toms and dietary habits.Materials and methods Patients Patients with IBS were recruited to participate in a dietary intervention which took place at two different time points. The inclusion criteria for the dietary inter - ventions were a diagnosis of IBS and age 18–70 years.Exclusion criteria were insufficient symptoms, i.e., < 175 scores on irritable bowel syndrome-severity scoring sys - tem (IBS-SSS) [ 28], alcohol or drug abuses, current eat - ing disturbances, pregnancy, presence of any organic GI disease, severe GI surgery in the past, severe organic and psychiatric diseases, severe food allergy or on gluten- free-, vegan-, low FODMAP-, or low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diets.
The first cohort was included January 2018-February 2019, which is described in detail previously [ 6, 7]. Briefly, lists were provided over all subjects who had received an IBS diagnosis (K58.0 or K58.9 according to the Interna - tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems – ICD-10) in primary healthcare cen - ters (PCC) or at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology during 2015–2017.In total, 1,679 unique IBS patients were identified.Invitation letters were randomly sent to 679 patients, followed by a phone call a couple of weeks later.Initially, 145 patients were willing to par - ticipate, but 40 patients were later excluded because they did not show up, were not willing to participate at later time point, or did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.Thus, 105 patients (23 (21.9%) men) were finally included in the study, corresponding to 15% inclusion rate (Fig.1).
The second recruitment process took place between December 2021 and September 2023 as described in detail [ 29]. Briefly, a data search was performed at Clini - cal Studies Sweden-Regional node for Southern Sweden from medical records of the County of Skåne for patients who had received an IBS diagnosis 2019–2022 accord - ing to the revised ICD-10 codes K58.1, K58.2, K58.3, and K58.9 [ 30].Of the 3,587 patients in the area close to Malmö, 744 were randomly contacted by a written letter to inform about the study, providing all contact details to both investigators and encouraged to call or email the investigators whether they were interested of the study.Out of these, 58 were willing to participate in the study.One written referral was obtained from a private health - care center and two phone call referrals from the Depart - ment of Gastroenterology were achieved.
Eight patients contacted the investigators since they had been encour - aged by the dietician or general practitioner (GP) at the Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05192603 (Date of registration 11/29/2021) and NCT03306381 (Date of registration 09/18/2017), respectively. Keywords Extraintestinal symptoms, Gastrointestinal symptoms, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Micronutrients, Vitamin D, Weight Page 3 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 PCC to participate.Nine patients contacted the inves - tigators due to information leaflets in the waiting room at their PCC and four patients after recommendations from friends or relatives.Of these, 16 fulfilled the inclu - sion criteria.Two different campaigns in social media were performed by a professional company to recruit subjects with a diagnosis of IBS given by their physician (Trialy, Gothenburg, Sweden).
The 218 patients who had assigned to participate in the study were contacted by phone by one of the investigators (BR), which led to that 140 patients were willing to participate and did not have any exclusion criteria. Out of all patients, some did not come to the first-time appointment ( n = 53), did not fulfill the inclusion criteria of 175 scores in total IBS- SSS ( n = 3), or fulfilled any exclusion criteria ( n = 3) at the baseline assessment (Fig.1).Finally, 155 IBS patients (72.4% of randomized cases; 48 (18.5%) men) could enter the dietary intervention (Fig.1).This means an inclusion rate of 42.7% in the group recruited from social media and 6.5% in the group recruited from medical records.Control subjects Healthy controls were recruited among hospital staff and medical students at Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, through personal invitation and advertisement.The controls were not allowed to have any current chronic or acute illness or GI symptoms.
Intake of multivitamins and hormonal contraceptive medicines was accepted, as well as temporary use of medications, such as seasonal allergy medicines and pain killers. Study design and clinical examination Both patients and controls completed the study ques - tionnaire with a diary book, and the questionnaires Rome IV, IBS-SSS, and visual analog scale for irritable bowel syndrome (VAS-IBS).All were examined for height and weight and body mass index (BMI) was cal - culated.BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 was defined as overweight and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was defined as obesity, according to the classification from the World Health Organization (WHO) [ 31].Blood samples were drawn in a non-fasting state, and sent to the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Skåne University Hospital, for analyses.
Questionnaires Study questionnaire All study participants were asked to complete a ques - tionnaire regarding sociodemographic factors, smoking habits, weekly alcohol intake, minutes of physical activ - ity per week leading to short of breath, pregnancies and Fig. 1 Flow chart over the recruitment process of patients with irritable bowel syndrome for randomization to either a diet with low content of ferment - able oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyol (FODMAP) or starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD).LCHF = low carbohydrate high fat diet Page 4 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 childbirth, medical history, drug treatments, and family history.The IBS patients also had to answer questions about previous and current dietary modifications due to GI symptoms.All liquid and solid food intake was regis - tered for 4 days (Wednesday-Saturday) [ 6].Rome IV questionnaire The Rome IV questionnaire was developed to diagnose DGBI [ 32].
Questions No 40–48 in the Swedish ver - sion of the questionnaire was used, after having received license from The Rome Foundation, Inc. Raleigh, NC, USA [ 33].Irritable bowel syndrome-severity scoring system IBS-SSS estimates abdominal pain, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, and the impact of bowel habits on daily life using visual analog scales (VAS) rang - ing from absent (0 mm) to very severe (100 mm) symp - toms.The number of days with abdominal pain in the last 10 days was reported.The maximum achievable score is 500.Scores ranging 75–174 indicate mild disease, 175– 299 indicate moderate disease, and ≥ 300 indicate severe disease.Extraintestinal symptoms (nausea, difficulties to eat a whole meal, headache, back pain, fatigue, belching/ excess wind, reflux, urinary urgency, leg pain, and mus - cle/joint pain) were estimated on VAS scales with maxi - mal achievable score of 500 [ 28].
Visual analog scale for irritable bowel syndrome The VAS-IBS covers the symptoms abdominal pain, diar - rhea, constipation, bloating and flatulence, vomiting and nausea, psychological well-being, and intestinal symp - toms’ influence on daily life, ranging from absent (0 mm) to very severe (100 mm) symptoms. The item psychologi - cal well-being has been shown to strongly correlate with anxiety in close relations, self-esteeism, and coping skills [34].The values are inverted from the original format and validated to measure changes over time, with reference values for healthy controls [ 35, 36].Laboratory analyses C-reactive protein (CRP), cobalamin, folate, iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D were analyzed in plasma of patients and serum in controls according to clinical routines at the Depart - ment of Clinical Chemistry [ 37].Reference values for healthy controls are available from the Department of Clinical Chemistry [ 37].
Due to changes in analysis rou - tines at the laboratory, CRP , cobalamin, folate, and ferri - tin were only comparable between controls and the first IBS cohort.Statistical analyses The statistical calculations were performed in IBM SPSS, version 29. Data were not normally distributed accord - ing to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and presented as median (interquartile ranges) or number (percent - ages).Age was categorized into age group < 29 years, 30–44 years, and > 45 years, according to the Public Health Agency of Sweden [ 38].To assure that the two IBS cohorts could be merged, characteristics of the two cohorts were compared and calculated, before com - parisons of the whole IBS cohort and controls.Mann- Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman’s test were used for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test was used for dichotomous variables.
Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to calculate differences between healthy volunteers and patients (predictor) with weight (adjusted for age) and laboratory analyses (adjusted for age and weight) as dependent variables, and to calculate differences in IBS patients regarding weight, BMI, and circulating levels of CRP and micronutrients (predictors) with GI and extraintestinal symptoms as dependent vari - ables, adjusted for age and weight (laboratory analyses). Values are given as β and 95% confidence interval (CI).To adjust for multiple comparisons in the GLM calcu - lations, crude p-values as well as the p-values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) set at 5% according to the Benjamin-Hochberg method were performed [ 39].The FDR-adjusted p-values were the main results.P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results Basal characteristics Altogether, 260 IBS patients were included who fulfilled the Rome IV criteria [ 1].
Of these, 90 had mixed IBS (IBS-M), 70 had diarrhea-predominated IBS (IBS-D), 46 had constipation-predominated IBS (IBS-C), and 10 had unspecified IBS (IBS-U). Forty-one had unspeci - fied functional bowel disorder (FBD), since they suffered from abdominal pain at least weekly, but without clear association between pain and altered bowel habits.Three patients had not completed the Rome IV questionnaire.The prevalence of IBS subgroups differed between sexes, with most men having IBS-D (40.0%) and most women having IBS-M (37.7%) ( p = 0.040).The age ( p = 0.094), sex distribution ( p = 0.257), weight ( p = 0.862), education ( p = 0.488), smoking habits (p = 0.984), alcohol intake ( p = 0.661), or physical activ - ity ( p = 0.636) were equal between the two IBS cohorts.In the latter cohort, more were married/living together (p < 0.001) and working full time or being students with fewer retirements ( p = 0.036) (Table 1).
There were no dif - ferences regarding the severity of specific GI symptoms in VAS-IBS or total extraintestinal IBS-SSS, and the total Page 5 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 Table 1 Basal characteristics Parameters Controls N = 50IBS 2018 N = 105IBS 2022 N = 155IBS patients N = 260P-value* P-value** Age (year) 37.85 (30.18–45.48) 46.00 (34.50–57.00)42.00 (32.00–55.00)44.00 (33.25-56.00)0.094 0.012 Gender (male/female) (n ,%) 13 (26)/37 (74) 23 (22)/82(78) 25 (16)/130(84) 48 (18.5)/212 (81.5) 0.257 0.244 Weight (kg) Missing64.6 (56.8–75.9) 71.4 (63.0-82.5) 669.2 (63.0-82.9) 70.5 (63.0-82.8) 60.862 0.002 BMI (kg/m2) Missing22.6 (20.8–25.2) 24.3 (22.3–28.0) 725.0 (22.6–28.2) 124.8 (22.4–27.8) 80.854 < 0.001 Education (n ,%) 0.488 0.017 Missing 2 1 3 Primary school 5 (4.8) 7 (4.5) 12 (4.6) Secondary school 3 (6.0) 23 (21.9) 23 (14.8) 46 (17.7) Education after secondary school 9 (18.0) 23 (21.9) 37 (23.9) 60 (23.1) Examination at university 38 (76.0) 52 (49.5) 87 (56.1) 139 (53.5) Occupation (n ,%) 0.036 0.038 Missing 3 1 4 Working full time 35 (70.0) 53 (50.5) 93 (60.0) 146 (56.2) Working 99 − 51% 8 (16.0) 13 (12.4) 15 (9.7) 28 (10.8) Working 50% 6 (5.7) 2 (1.3) 8 (3.1) Studying 7 (14.0) 5 (4.8) 20 (12.9) 25 (9.6) Sick leave 5 (4.8) 5 (3.2) 10 (3.8) Unemployment 3 (2.9) 5 (3.2) 8 (3.1) Retirement 16 (15.2) 14 (9.0) 30 (11.5) Other 1 (1.0) 0 1 (0.4) Marital status (n ,%) < 0.001 0.237 Missing 2 1 3 Living alone 13 (26.0) 41 (39.0) 30 (19.4) 71 (27.6) Living together 37 (74.0) 62 (59.0) 110 (71.0) 172 (66.2) Other 17 (6.5) Smoking (n ,%) 0.984 0.091 Never 36 (72.0) 54 (51.4) 84 (54.2) 138 (53.1) Former 10 (20.0) 37 (35.2) 54 (34.8) 91 (35.0) Present un regular 1 (2.0) 5 (4.8) 8 (5.2) 13 (5.0) Present regular 3 (6.0) 6 (5.7) 8 (5.2) 14 (5.4) Alcohol intake for 1 week (standard glass) (n ,%) 0.661 0.192 Missing 2 1 3 < 1 17 (34.0) 46 (43.8) 67 (43.2) 113 (43.5) 1–4 28 (56.0) 40 (38.1) 57 (36.8) 97 (37.3) 5–9 4 (8.0) 12 (11.4) 26 (16.8) 38 (14.6) 10–14 1 (2.0) 3 (2.9) 3 (1.9) 6 (2.3) ≥ 15 2 (1.9) 1 (0.6) 3 (1.2) Physical activity for 1 week (n ,%) 0.636 0.251 Missing 2 1 3 No time 3 (6.0) 11 (10.5) 18 (11.6) 29 (11.2) < 30 min 4 (8.0) 24 (22.9) 25 (16.1) 49 (18.8) 30–60 min 13 (26.0) 16 (15.2) 30 (19.4) 46 (17.7) 60–90 min 7 (14.0) 12 (11.4) 24 (15.5) 36 (13.8) 90–120 min 6 (11.8) 14 (13.3) 16 (10.3) 30 (11.5) < 120 min 17 (34.0) 26 (24.8) 41 (26.5) 67 (25.8) Physical activity means activity that leads to short of breath.
Mann-Whitney U-test for comparisons between the two IBS cohorts* and between controls and the whole IBS cohort**. Values are given as number and percentages and median and interquartile range.P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant Page 6 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 IBS-SSS were equal in the first and second cohort (310 (248–353) vs.300 (238–352), p = 0.352).Controls had more education at university level and were more often working full time with no sick leave and no retirements (Table 1).The patients had severe GI symptoms (Table 2), whereas the controls had low degree of symptoms within the reference values for healthy vol - unteers [ 36].The highest scored item on VAS-IBS was psychological well-being which was graded to 5 (0–22) mm.The most common comorbidities in IBS were allergy (13.1%), eczema (9.2%), and reflux/hiatus hernia (8.8%).
Eating disturbances was not asked for in the first cohort, but 18.1% of the IBS patients from the latter cohort had a history of any eating disturbances. No one had any actual eating disturbances.The most often used drugs were paracetamol (38.1%), non-steroid anti-inflamma - tory drugs (NSAID) (35.0%), and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (24.6%).IBS patients used several supplements such as minerals (13.5%), multivitamins (11.5%), and vitamin B/folic acid (8.8%).As much as 21.5% of the IBS partici - pants used any kind of vitamin D supplements, includ - ing pure vitamin D supplements (15.4%).Also, probiotics were frequently used (13.1%) (Table 3).Among controls, allergy (8.0%), eczema (6.0%), and exercise-induced asthma (4.0%) were found, and the most frequently used drug was anti-conception combina - tion pills (8.0%), with no use of vitamin or mineral sup - plement (Table 3).Weight and BMI The patients with IBS were elder than controls (44.00 (33.25-56.00) years vs.
37.85 (30.18–45.48) years, p = 0.012) and weighed more with higher BMI (Table 1). The difference remained after adjustment for age regard - ing weight (β: 5.880; 95% CI: 1.433–10.327; p = 0.010, FDR = 0.020), as well as for BMI (β: 2.02; 95% CI: 0.68– 3.36; p = 0.003, FDR = 0.012) (Fig.2).Among IBS par - ticipants, 127 patients (48.8%) were normal weight, 90 (34.6%) were overweight, and 35 (13.5%) were obese, whereas among controls, 37 subjects (74.0%) were normal weight, 11 (22.0%) overweight and 2 (4.0%) obese ( p = 0.007).When stratified into age groups, IBS patients had higher BMI than controls in age 18–29 years ( p = 0.021), with overweight/obesity in 47.8% in IBS compared with 9.1% in controls ( p = 0.037).In age 30–44 years, corresponding figures were 42.4% vs.26.9%, p = 0.176, and in the age above 45 years the prevalence was 55.4% vs.38.5%, p = 0.261.
Weight ( p < 0.001) and BMI ( p = 0.077) differed among IBS subgroups, with high - est weight and BMI in patients with IBS-D (78.3 (67.0- 89.6) kg and 26.2 (22.7–29.6) kg/m2, respectively) and lowest in IBS-C (66.0 (62.8–75.8) kg and 24.1 (22.2–26.2) kg/m2, respectively) (Fig. 3).In a sensitivity analysis including only women, the weight was still highest in IBS-D (72.0 (64.4–86.2) kg, p = 0.019).There were no dif - ferences in weight depending on any current diets (data not shown).Laboratory analyses More patients (18.1%) than controls (6.0%) had CRP lev - els above reference values ( p = 0.049).IBS patients had higher cobalamin levels and lower folate levels than con - trols, although all controls were within reference values in contrast to IBS patients (Table 4).
After adjustment for age and weight, levels of ferritin (β: 31.498; 95%: -2.559- 65.554, p = 0.070, FDR = 0.070) and TIBC levels (β: -3.254; 95%: -6.447-(-0.061), p = 0.046, FDR = 0.061) were equal between patients and controls. Most patients and controls had vitamin D levels below reference values (Table 4).

P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant Page 10 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 lactose free diet (41.9%), and vegetarian diet (9.6%), the only significant finding was a higher level of serum TIBC in the group with vegetarian diet compared with those eating animal products (65 (63–71) µmol/L vs. 61 (55– 68) µmol/L, p = 0.019).This could not be explained by different ages, since there was no age difference between those who were on vegetarian diet or not ( p = 0.295).When stratified for vitamin and mineral supplements in IBS, higher levels of circulating vitamin D were found in those who used supplements with vitamin D (71 (53–83) nmol/L vs.62 (50–73) nmol/L, p = 0.05), mul - tivitamins (72 (57–91) nmol/L vs.61 (49–73) nmol/L, p = 0.002), vitamin D and/or multivitamins (71 (56–86) vs.61 (49–72), p = 0.001) and minerals (68 (60–87) nmol/L vs.61 (49–73) nmol/L, p < 0.001) than those who did not use nutritional supplements (Fig.5).
Correlations In the whole study cohort, BMI correlated positively with CRP ( p < 0.001) and ferritin ( p < 0.001) and correlated inversely with iron ( p = 0.023), vitamin D ( p = 0.018), and transferrin saturation ( p = 0.031). Weight also correlated with CRP ( p < 0.001) and ferritin ( p < 0.001) (Table 7).When examining only the patient group, the inverse cor - relation between BMI and vitamin D was strengthened (rs=-0.166, p = 0.009).CRP correlated inversely with folate ( p = 0.003), iron ( p = 0.001), and transferrin saturation ( p = 0.001).Analyses reflecting the iron content correlated inversely with TIBC.Vitamin D correlated positively with folate (p = 0.014) and cobalamin ( p < 0.001), but inversely with TIBC ( p = 0.003) (Table 7).Since age correlated with weight, and age and weight correlated with several micronutrient levels and symp - toms, calculations between weight, micronutrient levels, and symptoms in the IBS patients were adjusted for these variables as appropriate.
Weight was inversely associ - ated with constipation, but BMI was mostly associated with aggravated extraintestinal symptoms such as head - ache, back pain, fatigue, leg pain, and muscle/joint pain, which remained statistically significant after FDR adjust - ment (Table 8). The GI symptom most often associated with micronutrients was bloating and flatulence, which was inversely associated with iron and transferrin satu - ration, but positively associated with TIBC.The inverse associations between iron and vomiting and nausea and total IBS-SSS were the only significant associations of GI symptoms which remained after FDR.Regarding extrain - testinal symptoms, iron was inversely associated with total extraintestinal IBS-SSS (Table 8).Discussion The main finding of the present study was that patients with IBS had higher CRP levels and were more often overweight or obese compared with healthy individu - als, especially IBS-D and in younger ages.Despite Fig.

Although the recruitment process was different in the two cohorts, with more patients from PCC and a third health care center in the first cohort, and more from social media in the latter cohort, the differences between the cohorts were limited. Some of the differ - ences between controls and IBS patients may depend on the slightly higher age in patients, which reflect both the increased degree of education through the years in the population, and occupation with more retired subjects among patients.The difference in prevalence of over - weight and obesity was most pronounced in younger age groups, but the difference in the whole cohort remained when adjusted for age.In the overall Swedish population during the same time, 28.3% of people 16–29 years have overweight or obesity, rendering that the prevalence of overweight in the youngest IBS group was 69% higher than in the general population [ 38].
The prevalence of overweight/obesity is 45.8% in the whole population [ 38], compared with 48.1% in our total IBS population. Overweight and obesity are risk factors to develop IBS according to a recent systematic review [ 40].In align - ment, the prevalence of IBS in obesity is as high as 31% [41, 42].A correlation between immunological mol - ecules and BMI in IBS patients suggest that the inflam - matory factors induced in obesity could contribute to IBS symptoms [ 43].The fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), another chronic pain syndrome, is also associated with overweight and obesity, with more aggravated associated symptoms such as morning stiffness, headache, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and IBS in overweight/obese sub - jects than in normal weight subjects [ 44].Thus, recent research show that obesity is associated with a general enhanced pain sensitivity [ 44].
Probably due to the over - weight, IBS patients have a significantly higher frequency of prediabetes, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, than healthy controls [ 45]. The presence of overweight, hyper - insulinemia, and prediabetes may lead to polyneuropathy with ensuing symptoms prior development of overt type 2 diabetes [ 46, 47].Another aspect is that IBS-related symptoms, such as increased symptoms after fiber intake, could contribute to difficulties to follow weight-loss pro - grams and a healthy eating pattern, thus resulting in the failure of weight-loss [ 48].Vitamin D is mainly synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydroxycholesterol when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light [ 24].Vitamin D receptors are present on almost all human cells [ 24].The low levels of vitamin D in the society may depend on less outdoor activities in the mod - ern society with more use of sunscreen and less intake of dairy products.
Further, oily fishes for sale are mainly farmed and contain less vitamin D than wild-caught fish [17]. According to a meta-analysis of 24,600 subjects, there is an increased relative risk for association between vitamin D deficiency and obesity [ 27], in agreement with our findings of lower vitamin D levels in the overweight patients.In a systematic review, most of the included studies showed that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk to develop obesity in adults and elder subjects [ 26].The relationship between vitamin D and obesity is bidi - rectional [ 49].Several mechanisms may explain the association between overweight and vitamin D deficiency.Obese patients may have less outdoor activities and more hours in front of computer or television, which reduces the possibility of skin exposure to sunlight and thereby lim - its the endogenous vitamin D production [ 50].Vitamin D is fat-soluble and absorbed by adipose tissue.
Vitamin D is released from the adipose tissue at a much slower rate, proportional to the concentration [ 51]. Vitamin D insufficiency may favor adiposity by increased levels of parathyroid hormones (PTH) and calcium inflow in adipocytes and lead to excessive differentiation between preadipocytes and adipocytes [ 52].High expression of vitamin D receptors in the adipose tissue may play a role in the development of the metabolic syndrome [ 53].A rat model showed how a vitamin D insufficient diet led to significant increase in body weight compared to a vita - min D adequate diet [ 54].The negative effects of vitamin D deficiency on adipose tissue expansion and inflamma - tory processes with secretion of proinflammatory adi - pokines along with the development of obesity, suggest a beneficial role of vitamin D on adipocyte metabolism [54].Hypothetically, vitamin D could be a possible treat - ment to prevent or reduce obesity.
The elevated CRP levels in the IBS patients are in align - ment with importance of inflammation for development of visceral hypersensitivity and IBS [ 1, 3]. In obese sub - jects, an association has been described between low vitamin D levels and inflammation [ 55].The combina - tion of low vitamin D levels and overweight/obesity in our present cohort may thus have contributed to the development of IBS.
Vitamin D deficiency may trig - ger IBS symptoms [ 22], through several immunological mechanisms aggravating both peripheral and central pain Page 13 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 Table 8 Associations between circulating micronutrient levels and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome Weight BMI Cobalamin Iron TIBC Transferrin saturation VAS-IBS Constipation -0.53(-0.80-(-0.26) p < 0.001, FDR = 0.019-1.07(-1.96-(-0.16)) p = 0.021, FDR = 0.0540.03(0.01–0.06) p = 0.018,FDR = 0.107 Bloating and flatulence -0.19(-0.37-0) p = 0.050, FDR = 0.150-0.54(-0.97-(-0.12)) p = 0.012, FDR = 0.0540.26(0.00-0.53) p = 0.050, FDR = 0.150-12.44(- 20.78-(-4.11)) p = 0.003, FDR = 0.054 Vomiting and nausea -0.967(-1.41-(-0.52)) p < 0.001, FDR = 0.018 Influence on daily life -0.46(-0.85-(-0.04)) p = 0.030, FDR = 0.105 Psychological well-being 0.36(0.05–0.66) p = 0.022, FDR = 0.108 IBS-SSS Headache 1.03(0.25–1.80) p = 0.010, FDR = 0.030-0.56(-1.11-(-0.20) p = 0.042, FDR = 0.108 Back pain 0.33(0.06–0.59) p = 0.016, FDR = 0.0721.54(0.67–2.41) p < 0.001, FDR = 0.0090.55(0.18–0.92) p = 0.004, FDR = 0.072 Fatigue 0.26(0.03–0.49) p = 0.029, FDR = 0.1041.09(0.33–1.84) p = 0.005, FDR = 0.018-0.56(-1.08-(-0.04) p = 0.035, FDR = 0.1050.36(0.04–0.68) p = 0.030, FDR = 0.108 Reflux 0.47(0.12–0.83) p = 0.009, FDR = 0.081 Leg pain 0.26(0.06–0.46) p = 0.009, FDR = 0.0720.94(0.28–1.59) p = 0.005, FDR = 0.0189.84(0.93– 8.76) p = 0.030, FDR = 0.213 Muscle/joint pain 0.33(0.06–0.59) p = 0.015, FDR = 0.0721.59(0.73–2.44) p < 0.001, FDR = 0.0090.04(0.01–0.07) p = 0.007, FDR = 0.063 Total IBS-SSS 0.09 (0.03–0.16) p = 0.006, FDR = 0.063-2.23(-3.65-(-0.81)) p = 0.002, FDR = 0.018 Total extraintestinal IBS-SSS 3.20(1.08–5.32) p = 0.003, FDR = 0.018-2.07 (-3.54-(-0.60)) p = 0.006, FDR = 0.0361.05 (0.14–1.96) p = 0.024, FDR = 0.108 Analyses of IBS patients with significant associations.
Specific gastrointestinal symptoms were measured by visual analog scale for irritable bowel syndrome (VAS-IBS) [ 35]. IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) assessed total gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms [ 28].Generalized linear model with gastrointestinal symptoms as dependent variable and weight, body mass index (BMI), and micronutrients as predictors, adjusted for age and weight (micronutrients).Values given as β and 95% confidence interval (CI).Crude p-values as well as the p-values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) set at 5% according to the Benjamini-Hochberg method [ 39] were performed for the calculations.The FDR-adjusted p-values were the main results.P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant Page 14 of 16 Roth and Ohlsson BMC Gastroenterology (2024) 24:296 stimulation leading to chronic pain and discomfort [ 21, 56].
Randomized controlled trials have shown improve - ment in IBS symptoms and health-related quality of life after vitamin D supplements [ 57, 58]. The mechanisms may be modulation of inflammatory mechanisms, since vitamin D associated inversely with BMI and inflamma - tory biomarkers, whereas BMI associated positively with a variety of inflammatory biomarkers [ 59].The effect of vitamin D on other health aspects such as depression and fatigue may be another reason to improved symptoms and quality of life [ 58].Furthermore, vitamin D affects mucosal homeostasis, with increased expressions of tight junctions and preserved structural integrity, decreas - ing the risk for increased permeability and improving the regulation of gut microbiota composition and func - tion [ 60, 61].The IBS patients in the current study had lower intake of dairy products but used several vitamin D supplements, which may have modified their experienced symptoms.
We have previously published that several IBS patients have poor dietary habits with high intake of sugar and processed food and low intake of fruits and vegetables [62]. In addition, a high frequency of self-prescribed elimination diets was found, which can further deterio - rate micronutrient intake.Vitamin D may be a marker of malnutrition and poor lifestyle habits, since it cor - related with BMI, folate, cobalamin, and TIBC.Others have shown that TIBC was the only iron index that was associated with vitamin D deficiency [ 63].Thus, vitamin D and TIBC may be the most important analyses in this context.In the current study, TIBC was the only analysis affected in vegetarian diet.The low vitamin D levels also in controls suggest that several in the society have insuf - ficient intake of many micronutrients and/or low num - ber of outdoor activities.Other studies have found lower levels of vitamin D in IBS patients compared with non- IBS patients [ 64].
Blood samples were mainly collected in the spring in controls and more throughout the year in the patients, which means that controls could have had higher levels compared with IBS if sample collection had been more equal regarding season. Furthermore, the frequent use of vitamin and mineral supplements in the IBS group compensates for the poor nutritional intake by food.If IBS patients had not used so many supple - ments, they should have had lower values than controls, as observed when comparing vitamin D levels in users or not of vitamin D and minerals.On the other hand, the lower levels of vitamin D in IBS patients may partly be explained by overweight and obesity [ 26, 27, 48, 50].PPI was only sparsely used by controls but often used by IBS patients.
The risk of malnutrition with lower levels of cir - culating micronutrients during PPI treatment has been debated for a long time, but no clear conclusions about the PPI effects have been possible to draw in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ 65, 66]. There are several micronutrients we never measure, and which are not replaced by vitamin D or other vitamin supplements.Those other micronutrients may also be of great importance for symptom development and the pro - cess towards visceral hypersensitivity and chronic pain.Furthermore, environmental exposures, such as air pol - lutants and microbial exposure, have also been linked to IBS development and gut dysbiosis, and could affect vis - ceral hypersensitivity [ 67].This study has several limitations, one being the cross- sectional character of the study, without possibilities to examine causality.At the time point for inclusion, the controls had less weight and BMI, but were also younger.
These differences may be confounders in the results described. However, age and weight were adjusted for in the statistical calculations, and participants were divided into age groups for weight comparisons.The question remains whether controls, with their lower vitamin D levels, will develop more overweight and IBS later in life.The small control cohort, with controls from hospi - tal staff and students is a limitation increasing the risk of Type II errors but is explained by the difficulties to recruit controls.However, the use of existing reference values for GI symptoms and blood samples is a strength [ 36, 37].The diary books were not completed by all participants, which is a limitation.Furthermore, the registered food items do not necessarily mean the actual intake.Another limitation of the study is that the controls did not pro - vide information about ongoing adherence to varying diets.
Therefore, the influence of current diets on labora - tory levels could not be examined in the control group. The completion of the symptom questionnaires may be affected by other factors, e.g., psychological factors, and not only the symptoms.However, only validated ques - tionnaires were used, to ensure that the tool reliably and accurately measures what it is intended to measure.Conclusions In conclusion, IBS patients were often overweight or obese with low vitamin D levels.This illustrates the com - plexity of IBS and the multifactorial nature of its symp - toms, including the potential contributions of nutritional deficiencies and comorbid conditions.Further research is needed to explore these associations in greater detail and longitudinal studies must be conducted to establish causative links.
Improved awareness of the importance of healthy dietary habits is necessary and treatment of IBS should maybe also include weight-reducing dietary and supplemental treatment of vitamins and mineral deficiencies.
