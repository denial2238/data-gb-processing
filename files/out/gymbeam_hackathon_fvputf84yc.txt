We aimed to assess the effect of whey protein supplementation alone or with vitamin D on lean mass (LM), strength, and function in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases.Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on sarcopenia outcomes in healthy and sarcopenic orfrail older adults were included.Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for LM, muscle strength, and physical function data.The analysis showed that whey protein supplementation had no effect on LM and muscle strength; nevertheless, a signi ﬁcant improvement was found in physical function (SMD ¼0.561; 95% con ﬁdence interval [CIs]: 0.256, 0.865, n¼33), particularly gait speed (GS).
On the contrary, whey protein supplementation signi ﬁcantly improved LM (SMD ¼0.982; 95% CI: 0.228, 1.736; n¼11), appendicular lean mass and physical function (SMD ¼1.211; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.834; n¼16), and GS in sarcopenic/frail older adults. By contrast, co-supplementation with vitamin D enhanced LM gains (SMD ¼0.993; 95% CI: 0.112, 1.874; n¼11), muscle strength (SMD ¼2.005; 95% CI: 0.975, 3.035; n¼ 11), and physical function (SMD ¼3.038; 95% CI: 2.196, 3.879; n¼18) signi ﬁcantly.Muscle strength and physical function improvements after whey protein supplementation plus vitamin D were observed without resistance exercise (RE) and short study duration subgroups.Moreover, the combination of whey protein and vitamin D with RE did not enhance the effect of RE.Whey protein supplementation improved LM and function in sarcopenic/frail older adults but had no positive effect in healthy older persons.
By contrast, our meta-analysis showed that co-supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D is effective, particularly in healthy older adults, which is likely owing, wepropose, to the correction of vitamin D insuf ﬁciency or de ﬁciency. The trial was registered at https://inplasy.com as INPLASY202240167.Keywords : resistance exercise, frailty, muscle, mobility, physical function Statements of Signi ﬁcance This meta-analysis examined the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on lean mass and sarcopenia-related out- comes.We report that whey and vitamin D supplementation could augment lean mass and sarcopenia-related outcomes in certain populations andsome circumstances.These are novel ﬁndings because whey protein and vitamin D are frequently included ingredients in oral nutritional sup- plements targeted at older persons requiring skeletal muscle function.

It is associated with falls, fractures, disability, frailty, and an increased risk of chronic metabolic diseases.Peopleclassi ﬁed as sarcopenic are more frequent users of health care systems [ 1–3].Guidelines for sarcopenia treatment [ 4] include incorporating resistance exercise (RE), optimizing proteinintake, and addressing insuf ﬁciency or de ﬁciency of vitamin D; however, there is a lack of clarity regarding the effective com-bination of these variables.Higher habitual protein intakes areassociated with lean mass (LM) preservation and improvedmuscle function in older adults [ 5,6].
A recent meta-analysis showed that protein intakes of 1.2 –1.59 g/kg/d added to RE training positively affected LBM and function in older adults [ 7]. Whey protein is an easily digestible high-quality protein con-taining all essential amino acids, particularly leucine, a keyactivator of muscle protein synthesis [ 8].Vitamin D has multiple effects on the muscle, such as regu- lation of gene expression, differentiation, neuromuscular func-tion, and production of anti-in ﬂammatory cytokines [ 9,10].Studies have also shown that optimizing vitamin D status isimportant in maintaining muscle mass and function in olderadults [ 11], and vitamin D status is related to muscle mass and strength changes [ 10].Notably, the normalization of circulating vitamin D concentration from de ﬁcient or insuf ﬁcient to replete may be critical in dictating the ef ﬁcacy of protein (or other amino acids) supplementation [ 12,13].
Although some in- terventions, such as whey protein supplementation and vitaminD optimization, are suggested as effective ways to protect againstsarcopenia, the ef ﬁcacy of such interventions is unclear. Although several systematic reviews on different populations and interventions have been published in recent years [ 14–17], a conclusion regarding whether whey protein supplementationalone or with vitamin D is bene ﬁcial for sarcopenia-related outcomes in older people is unknown.This systematic reviewand meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D and with or without RE on LM, muscle strength, and physical func-tion in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty.
Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was developed ac- cording to the guidelines laid out in the Cochrane Handbook forSystematic Reviews of Interventions [ 18] and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) report [ 19]. The study protocol was registered in the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY; registration number: INPLASY202240167).All research team members agreed on thestudy ’s steps: identi ﬁcation, screening, data extraction, and analysis.Eligibility criteria Inclusion/exclusion criteria based on the PICOS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and setting) of the study aredetailed in Table 1 .
To be considered eligible for inclusion,studies were required to be an RCT investigating the effects of whey protein supplementation or whey protein and vitamin Dco-supplementation (with or without exercise training) onmeasures of sarcopenia in older adults with or without sarco-penia or frailty (older than 60 years) and without any other overtdisease that may affect the outcome. Randomized controlledtrials (parallel or crossover design) published in English wereincluded.Nonhuman studies (animal, in vitro, and in vivostudies), cross-sectional studies, reviews, gray literature (book chapters, abstracts in conferences, editorials, letters, and semi- nars), studies without any control groups or with protein-basedcontrol groups, studies with a special diet, and studies lackinginformation for extracting mean and standard deviation [SD; orstandard error (SE)] were excluded.
No restriction was consid-ered on the type of whey protein and its dosage, interventionduration, measurement tools, and type or duration of RE. Itshould be noted that although we did not limit the type andduration of RE, only those RCTs were included in which bothintervention and control groups were exposed to the same RE.Systematic search strategy A comprehensive literature search was performed for RCT investigating the effects of whey protein supplementation onsarcopenia measures up to June 2022.

Nasimi et al. Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 762 –773 763 as PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, were searched to ﬁnd eligible articles.The search strategy was mentioned in the studyprotocol (available on https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022 -4-0167/ ) and the supplementary ﬁle“search strategy.”Refer- ences were imported to the software Endnote X8 for removingduplicates and screening.Screening, data extraction, and outcome measures Studies were screened for eligibility criteria, such as study design, whey protein supplementation intervention, partici-pant’s condition, control group, and measures of sarcopenia, such as LBM, strength, or physical function.The titles and ab- stracts were reviewed in duplicate by members of the reviewteam (NN, ZG), and any, if marked for inclusion by eitherreviewer, were reviewed as a full text.Two people conductedfull-text inclusion independently (NN, ZG).All disagreementswere resolved through discussions.
One investigator (NN)extracted data, which were checked for accuracy by a secondinvestigator (SJ). Data on study characteristics, population de-tails, intervention and control conditions, and numerical data forthe outcomes of LM [total lean mass (TLM) and appendicularlean mass (ALM)], muscle strength (upper body and lower body strength), and physical function were extracted.Muscle strength outcomes included upper body strength [handgrip strength(HGS)] or lower body strength (leg press or knee extension).Physical function outcomes were as follows: gait speed (GS; inmeters per second), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)score, or other physical tests with units of seconds, such as timeup-and-go, time chair stand balance test, sit-to-stand, andwalking time.Because different studies used multiple tests tomeasure such outcomes, we used all information reported formuscle mass, strength, and physical function outcomes.
The GetData Graph Digitizer ( http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/ ) was used to extract data from the ﬁgures when the data were not available in the tables, text, or after multiple attempts to contactauthors. Quality assessment and risk of bias The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the qualityof evidence for the study outcomes.Six criteria were considered:risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publicationbias, and effect size.A GRADE rating summary was generatedusing the GRADEpro platform ( https://gdt.gradepro.org/ ).The risk of bias was assessed using a Revised Cochrane Risk of Biastool for randomized trials (RoB2) and ROBVIS-1 tool [ 20].All included studies were evaluated for sources of bias in selection,performance, detection, attrition, and selective reporting.On thebasis of the guidelines, studies were classi ﬁed into low-risk, with some concerns, and high-risk categories.
All risk-of-bias assess- ments were performed in duplicate (NN, MA). Statistical analysis The mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) of change as the effect size with their corresponding SEs were calculated from the primary studies.The 3-level random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size andthe 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs).The SD of change was calculated using the following formula:SDchange ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ SD 2 PreþSD2 Post/C0ðSD Pre/C2SD PostÞq Similar to the previous meta-analysis [ 7], for pooling of physical function outcomes, the direction of effect was adjusted toensure consistency of the outcome responses, that is, a reductionin GS measured in seconds to perform the task re ﬂects a better outcome.By contrast, increasing GS measured in meter per sec- ond re ﬂects a positive outcome.
Similarly, a reduction in sit-to-stand test (seconds), 5-chair repetition test (seconds), andtimed up-and-go test (in seconds) are considered positive re-sponses, whereas an increase in 1-leg standing test (seconds) andSPPB score re ﬂects a positive outcome. Therefore, when a decrement in the absolute variable was considered the positive orbeneﬁcial outcome, we multiplied the δvalues by /C01.This approach normalizes all effect sizes, meaning all SMDs are posi-tive and re ﬂect improvements.All data were extracted and included in the analysis for studies that evaluated sarcopenia outcomes using various methods.Statistical heterogeneity was examined using Cochran Q test and I 2statistic.We interpreted I2 of 30% to 60% as moderate and 60% to 90% as substantial het- erogeneity.
A subgroup analysis was conducted to determine thesources of heterogeneity according to the measurements, RE(with and without), the dose of supplementation ( /C2020 g and >20 g), and intervention duration ( /C2012 weeks and >12 weeks). A sensitivity analysis based on the leave-1-out method was con-ducted to investigate whether the results were robust.Begg rankcorrelation test, Egger linear regression test, and funnel plots wereused to detect publication bias.All analyses were performed using the metafor package in R v.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org/ ).Results Literature search and study selection The results of the literature search are shown in Figure 1 .Three databases were searched, and 1712 records were identi- ﬁed.
After screening for duplicate and nonrelevant studies, 89 articles were selected for full-text reviewing and eligibility.Accordingly, 59 studies were excluded owing to the followingreasons: using multi-ingredient supplementation (i.e., wheyprotein and vitamin D, other components such as vitamin E, andomega-3 lipids), applying particular diet therapy besides thesupplementation, studying postmenopausal women in the agerange of 50 –55 years, and using protein-based placebo in the control group. Finally, 30 RCTs remained at the end of thescreening process, including 22 studies evaluating whey proteinsupplementation alone and 8 studies assessing whey protein plus vitamin D supplementation.A meta-analysis was performed separately on each group of studies.Study characteristics for RCTs The summary information from the included studies is presented in Supplemental Table S1 .
The studies were per- formed in Brazil [ 21–25], United States [ 26–29], United Kingdom [ 30,31], Europe [ 11,32–42], Canada [ 43], Australia [44], China [ 45], Korea [ 46], Japan [ 47,48], and Taiwan [ 49]. These studies were published between 2012 and 2022.Theparticipants in the studies were healthy [ 21,23,25,27,30–33, 36,37,39,42–44,47,48], sarcopenic [ 11,24,35,40,41,45,49],N.Nasimi et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 762 –773 764 frail [ 22,38,46], and mobility-limited [ 26,28,29,34]o l d e r adults (aged 60 years or older) .The intervention duration ranged from 12 weeks to 2 years and 8 weeks to 24 weeks inwhey protein and combined whey protein and vitamin Dstudies, respectively.
The dose of whey protein varied from 15to 40 g/d (68% of the studies prescribed >20 g/d) in the studies evaluating whey protein supplementation and from 8.5 to 40 g/d (38% of the studies speci ﬁed>20 g/d) in studies related to the whey protein plus vitamin D supplementation.Moreover, the dose of vitamin D ranged from 100 to 800 IU.The placebo or control groups received carbohydrate-basednutrients such as maltodextrin, corn starch, collagen, ornothing. However, studies differed on isocaloric or non-isocaloric placebo in the control groups.Furthermore, 20studies (66% of all included RCTs) had RE in both interventionand control groups [ 21–25,28–31,34–38,40–43,47,48], including 15 of 22 trials of whey protein supplementation and 5 of 8 trials of whey and vitamin D co-supplementation.Almost all included studies (28/30) evaluated LM changes regarding TLM [ 21,22,24,26–30,33,34,36–38,40,43,45,49] and ALM [ 11,21–25,29–32,36,37,39,41,42,44–46 ,48,49].
Data regarding the effect of whey protein supplementation alone orwith vitamin D on muscle strength were extracted from 17studies for HGS [ 11,22,31,32,35,38–49] and 20 studies for lower body strength, such as knee extension [ 21–25,28–34,36–38,43, 44,47,48] and leg press [ 11,22,31,32,35,38–42,44–49]. Changes in physical function were extracted from 22 studies, includingSPPB [ 11,28–32,35,36,39,45,46], GS (in meters per second) [ 11, 28–30,32,34,42,43,45–47,49], and other physical tests (sec- onds) [ 11,22 ,24,28,32,33,36,37,39,42–46,48].Fat mass was also reported in 14 studies [ 21,24,26–32,36,40,42,43,49].Meta-analysis Effect of whey protein supplementation on LM All included studies showed that whey protein supplemen- tation had no signi ﬁcant effect on LM (SMD ¼0.165; 95% CI: /C00.154, 0.484; n¼31) ( Table 2 ;Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure S2 ).
On the contrary, the subgroup analysis showed that whey protein supplementation signi ﬁcantly improved LM in sarcopenic/frail older adults (SMD ¼0.982; 95% CI: 0.228, 1.736; n¼11) ( Table 2 ;Supplemental Figure S3 ). The results from other subgroup analyses, including TLM/ALM, RE, wheydose, and study duration, showed no signi ﬁcant effect.Analyses also showed that the changes in LM were mostly related tochanges in ALM compared with those to TLM (SMD ¼0.374; 95% CI: /C00.036, 0.784; n¼15 vs.SMD ¼/C00.038; 95% CI: /C00.528, 0.452; n¼16, respectively) ( Supplemental Table S1 ), although this was not statistically signi ﬁcant.The separate analysis of TLM and ALM are also summarized in Supplemental Tables S4 and S5 , respectively.The results indi- cated that whey protein supplementation did not signi ﬁcantly affect TLM (MD ¼/C00.069; 95% CI: /C00.499, 0.362; n¼16) (Supplemental Figure S4 ) or ALM (MD ¼0.166; 95% CI: /C00.093, FIGURE 1.

However, when per- forming the analysis in the subgroup with RE, the positive effectof whey protein supplementation on strength was detected in thesubgroup in which both intervention and control groups wereexposed to RE (SMD ¼0.238; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.474; n¼21) (Supplemental Figure S9 ) compared with that in the subgroup without RE. Moreover, whey protein at doses higher than 20 gimproved muscle strength (SMD ¼0.252; 95% CI: 0.051, 0.453;TABLE 2 Effect of whey protein supplementation on changes in LM Groups/subgroups Effect size (SMD)95% CI No.

In addition, after analyzing the effects on lower body strength, whey protein supplementa-tion was ineffective in increasing strength (MD ¼1.187; 95% CI: /C00.861, 3.235; n¼21) ( Supplemental Table S7 ;Supplemental Figure S12 ). Effect of whey protein supplementation on physical function The analysis revealed that whey protein supplementation improved physical performance (SMD ¼0.561; 95% CI: 0.256, 0.865; n¼33) ( Table 4 ;Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure S13 ).Moreover, signi ﬁcant effects were found when considering sarcopenic or frail participants (SMD ¼1.211; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.834; n¼16) ( Supplemental Figure S14 ), GS (SMD ¼1.00; 95% CI: 0.218, 1.782; n¼9), without RE (SMD ¼1.551; 95% CI: 0.834, 2.267; n¼14) ( Supplemental Figure S15 ) ,d o s el o w e rt h a n2 0go fw h e yp r o t e i ns u p p l e m e n t (SMD ¼3.379; 95% CI: 1.765, 4.994; n¼7) (Supplemental Figure S16 ), and study duration of >12 weeks (SMD ¼1.042; 95% CI: 0.503, 1.582; n¼18) ( Supplemental Figure S17 ).
Effects of whey protein supplementation on SBBP, GS, andother physical tests are presented in Supplemental Tables S8 –S10. The analysis considering all RCTs showed no signiﬁcant main effects in SPPB (MD ¼0.186; 95% CI: /C00.507, 0.879; n¼7) (Supplemental Figure S18 )a n do t h e rp h y s i c a l tests (MD ¼0.209; 95% CI: /C00.434, 0.853; n¼17) ( Supple- mental Figure S20 ).There was no effect of whey protein supplementation on GS (MD ¼0.061; 95% CI: /C00.001, 0.122; n¼9) (Supplemental Table S9 ;Supplemental Figure S19 ).However, a subgroup analysis by RE and >20 g doses of whey protein showed that GS was higher in participants supple-mented with whey protein (MD ¼0.034; 95% CI: 0.004, 0.064; n¼5, and MD ¼0.047; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.076; n¼4, respectively).Furthermore, a signi ﬁcant effect was found for subgroups of sarcopenic or frail participants (MD ¼0.051; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.086; n¼5) and study duration /C2012 weeks (MD¼0.064; 95% CI: 0.034, 0.095; n¼5).
In addition, results showed that supplementation with whey had no signi ﬁcanteffect on fat mass (MD ¼/C00.033; 95% CI: /C00.465, 0.398; n¼ 12) ( Supplemental Table S11 ). Effect of whey protein and vitamin D supplementation on LM Contrary to the nonsigni ﬁcant effect of whey protein supple- mentation on LM, whey protein plus vitamin D co-supplementationpositively affected LM (SMD ¼0.993; 95% CI: 0.112, 1.874; n¼ 11).Moreover, there was a signi ﬁcant main effect in subgrouping regarding study duration /C2012 weeks (SMD ¼1.651; 95% CI: 0.118, 3.183; n¼7) (Supplemental Table S12 ;Supplemental Figure S21 ).However, no signi ﬁcant effect was observed after subgrouping participants ( Supplemental Figure S22 ).
Effect of whey protein and vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength The effect of whey protein plus vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength was signi ﬁcant when all RCTs were analyzed (SMD ¼2.005; 95% CI: 0.975, 3.035; n¼11) ( Supplemental Table S13 ;Supplemental Figure S23 ). This effect was also found in the subgroups of HGS (SMD ¼2.943; 95% CI: 1.431, 4.455; n ¼8), without RE (SMD ¼2.800; 95% CI: 1.075, 4.526; n¼5), and study duration /C2012 weeks (SMD ¼3.078; 95% CI: 1.299, 4.857; n¼8).This effect was also seen in the participant sub- group, whereas the effect size in the healthy group was higherthan that in the sarcopenic or frail group (SMD ¼2.386.95% CI 0.741, 4.032; n¼6, vs.SMD ¼1.722; 95% CI: 0.170, 3.274; n¼ 5) (Supplemental Table S13 ;Supplemental Figure S24 ).
Effect of whey protein and vitamin D supplementation on physical function The evidence showed that whey protein and vitamin D sup- plementation positively affected physical function changes (SMD¼3.038; 95% CI: 2.196, 3.879; n¼18) ( Supplemental Table S14 ;Supplemental Figure S25 ). A similar effect was also found in both participant subgroups, whereas the subgroup with healthy older adults showed a greater effect size than the sub- group with sarcopenic or frail older adults (SMD ¼4.290; 95% CI: 2.713, 5.867; n¼10, vs.SMD ¼1.666; 95% CI: 0.676, 2.656; n¼6) (Supplemental Table S14 ;Supplemental Figure S26 ).Moreover, the subgroup analysis considering SPPB (SMD ¼ TABLE 3 Effect of whey protein supplementation on changes in muscle strength Groups/subgroups Effect size (SMD)95% CI No.

Contrary to the results obtained from the ef- fect of whey protein on GS, whey protein plus vitamin D sup-plementation had no positive effect on GS.Risk of bias and heterogeneity of the included studies The summary of the risk-of-bias analysis and traf ﬁc light ﬁgure of each domain of the risk-of-bias assessment are shown inSupplemental Figure S1A,B .
The risk-of-bias analysis demon- strated that selection bias was reported in 6 studies, 5 studieswith some concerns, and 1 high-risk study owing to the lack ofinformation regarding randomization or allocation methods.Regarding performance bias, 6 studies were scored as havingsome concerns, and 2 had a high risk of bias. Regarding the thirddomain, 2 studies were identi ﬁed with some risk of detection bias due to missing data.Almost half of the studies (15 RCTs)reported a risk of attrition bias due to a lack of informationregarding outcome assessor awareness of the intervention received.Furthermore, all included studies provided clear results for all outcomes per the prespeci ﬁed analysis plan and were considered at low risk of reporting bias.Heterogeneity for theTABLE 4 Effect of whey protein supplementation on changes in physical function Groups/subgroups Effect size (SMD)95% CI No.

Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 762 –773 768 main effects of whey protein supplementation alone and with vitamin D on all evaluated sarcopenia outcomes was consider-ably high ( I 2>80%; P<0.0001) ( Tables 2 –4). A potential source of heterogeneity is the difference between study partici-pants, healthy [ 15,17,19,21,24–27,30,31,33,36–38,41,42], sar- copenic [ 9,18,29,34,35,39,43], frail [ 16,32,40], and mobility-limited [ 20,22,23,28] older adults.However, differ- ences in duration of the studies and the range of supplementdoses tested might have contributed as sources of heterogeneity(Supplemental Table S1 ).After excluding studies from all ana- lyses using the leave-1-out method, there were no signi ﬁcant changes in all our ﬁndings (data not shown).Quality of evidence The GRADEpro evidence pro ﬁle rating results for changes in sarcopenia measures with whey protein supplementation aloneor with vitamin D in healthy older adults are presented in Sup- plemental Tables S2 and S3 .
In the studies reporting the effect of whey protein supplementation, the GRADE rating was found tobe low and very low for included variables. Studies reporting theeffects of whey protein and vitamin D supplementation were alsoof low and very low quality.The funnel plots for LM, musclestrength, muscle function, TLM, ALM, HGS, lower body strength,SPPB, GS, and other physical tests for whey protein supple-mentation and LM, muscle strength, and function for co- supplementation of whey protein and vitamin D are shown in Supplemental Figures S27 –S39.Asymmetry was found in the pooled models.Discussion We examined the effects of whey protein with and without vitamin D supplementation on measures relevant to sarcopenia.We found that whey protein supplementation did not increaseLM in healthy older participants but did affect LM in sarco-penic or frail older persons.
The result of this meta-analysisconcurs with a recent analysis on protein supplementation,showing that the changes in LM were largely (if not exclu-sively) related to the effects of RE rather than protein supple-mentation [ 7]. Many trials have con ﬁrmed that recommending protein supplementation as a stand-alone intervention for olderadults has no signi ﬁcant effects on muscle mass or strength [21,22,30,33].Our results are noteworthy because older adults exhibit impaired muscle anabolism in response to proteinintake [ 50,51].However, in a subgroup analysis, whey protein supplementation signi ﬁcantly improved LM in sarcopenic or frail older adults (particularly ALM).Older adults with low LMmay have higher requirements for protein, which could un-derpin the effects of whey protein in sarcopenic or frail persons[52].The effect of vitamin D plus whey protein on increasing LM was signi ﬁcant.This result was pronounced in the subgroups with a study duration of /C2012 weeks.Bauer et al.
[ 11] reported an effect of co-supplementation with whey protein with vitamin D on LM. We propose that correcting vitamin D de ﬁciency or insufﬁciency likely underpins this co-supplementation effect [53].Vitamin D can improve muscle mass through genomic and nongenomic pathways [ 54].The main mechanisms of the anabolic effects of vitamin D on muscle anabolism are not fullyunderstood; nevertheless, its positive in ﬂuence on muscle pro- tein anabolism has been shown [ 53,55].Analyzing all included RCTs showed no signi ﬁcant change in muscle strength gains with whey protein supplementation;however, signi ﬁcant increases were seen in subgroups who engaged in RE and consumed whey protein doses higher than 20 g.In another meta-analysis, the effects of protein supplementa- tion on muscle strength were mainly observed in RE-trainedparticipants [ 56].
According to 2 other studies, improvement in muscle strength after whey protein ingestion was enhanced inthose with RE, which is in line with the results of previous work[57,58]. Resistance training enhances functional capacity and muscle strength [ 59] due to the anabolic responses to RE sepa- rate from dietary supplementation [ 60,61].Training or exercise is an important inducer of muscle hypertrophy, particularly inolder adults [ 62].Other studies have shown that higher protein doses of 30 –35 g of whey protein may positively affect muscle protein synthesis [ 63,64], indicating that higher doses may be advantageous, particularly in older persons [ 65].Our analysis showed that co-supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D signi ﬁ cantly affected muscle strength gains.This ﬁnding is in contrast to the effect of whey protein supplementation alone.
Signi ﬁcant results were also seen in the subgroups without RE in studies lasting 12 weeks or less, high-lighting the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the shortterm. However, we did not observe an effect of supplementationwhen RE was used, which is due to the much greater in ﬂuence of RE in improving LM and strength [ 66].Because both the control and intervention groups were exposed to RE, the nutritional supplement-mediated effect is markedly attenuated, orcompletely obscured, by the RE training-mediated effect.However, whey protein supplementation improved physical function signi ﬁcantly, which was mainly related to the changes in GS.Results were pronounced in the subgroups without RE,with lower doses of whey protein ( <20 g), in sarcopenic or frail older adults, and studies with durations of >12 weeks.We are unsure how whey protein supplementation would promote suchan effect, but it may relate to subtle changes in LM or a previ-ously unrecognized mechanism.
Supplementation with vitamin D plus whey protein signi ﬁ- cantly improved physical function. This ﬁnding was also conﬁrmed by a study reviewing the effect of nutrition supple- mentation (containing protein and vitamin D) on physical per-formance in older people [ 67].In that meta-analysis, the effects of nutritional supplementation were mainly pronounced onphysical outcomes rather than muscle strength [ 67].In line with this study, in another review, vitamin D plus protein supple-mentation did not affect LM in sarcopenic or frail participants[68].There is an idea that muscle mass and strength changes do not happen concurrently with changes in physical function.Instead, other mechanisms could improve physical function, such as neural adaptations, enhanced metabolic function, andnonhypertrophic remodeling of the contractile machinery [ 69, 70].
In subgroup analyses, the change was signi ﬁcant in SPPB and other physical tests in the subgroups consuming lower dosesof whey ( <20 g), without RE, and in studies of shorter durations (<12 weeks). Physical function could be affected by protein or vitamin D ingestion.Optimizing vitamin D status is an importantfactor affecting muscle mass and function [ 71], and it can boostN.Nasimi et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 762 –773 769 muscle strength and function by improving muscle anabolism when combined with leucine [ 53].One of our main ﬁndings is that whey protein plus vitamin D affected muscle strength and physical function in the subgroupwithout RE.This result contrasts with some data showing abeneﬁcial effect of whey protein plus RE [ 72].However, this was not observed in our meta-analysis because the effects were seen in those without RE.The differences between our results andothers [ 72] could be for various reasons.
Our analysis showed that most of the effects of whey protein supplementation onmuscle strength and function are shown in longer durations(>12 weeks) studies. However, the effects of whey protein plus vitamin D supplementation were observed in shorter-durationstudies ( /C2012 weeks).We propose that these ﬁndings are related to the fact that short-term supplementation with vitaminD corrects de ﬁcient or insuf ﬁcient levels of the vitamin and ex- erts its bene ﬁcial effects similarly rapidly [ 73].Nonetheless, heterogeneity was found to be very high, and the overall quality of the evidence was low or very low for most outcomes in thisdomain.We need to acknowledge the limitations of our meta-analysis.Various nonuniform muscle strength and physical functionmeasures were used in different studies, making the comparisonor interpretation unclear.The same is true for using multiplemethods for measuring LM, which may have added to the highdegree of heterogeneity in some domains we analyzed.
Moderateto high heterogeneity seems to be a persistent ﬁnding in meta- analyses involving protein ingestion studies depending on the outcome; for example, an I 2of 72% for LM in Tagawa et al. [ 74]; anI2of 20% for LM and 50% –60% for strength and physical function in Nunes et al.[ 7]; an I2of 50% –56% for strength in Tagawa et al.[ 75]; and an I2of 90% or more for strength and physical function in Chang et al.[ 15].We also found asymmetry in the funnel plots of the pooled model, although this is likelyrelated more to heterogeneity than publication bias.Subgroup-level analyses resulted in some domains containingfewer studies, and thus smaller populations, and should beinterpreted cautiously.The overall quality of the evidence wasmostly low or very low; hence, our ﬁndings need to be inter- preted with this caveat in mind.
A strength of our analysis was the comprehensive and simultaneous assessment of the effects ofwhey protein or combined whey and vitamin D supplementationon all sarcopenia measures in healthy and sarcopenic or frailolder adults. In summary, whey protein supplementation did not increase LM, even when combined with RE in healthy older adults but didimprove LM (mainly ALM) in sarcopenic or frail older adults.Similarly, whey protein supplementation did not affect musclestrength, but improvements were seen with higher doses of whey(>20 g) when combined with RE.Longer duration ( >12 weeks) whey protein supplementation signi ﬁcantly improved physical function, particularly GS, but the addition of RE superseded theeffects of the protein supplementation and supplementationprovided no further bene ﬁt.Nonetheless, in all domains, the quality of evidence was low.
However, whey protein did affectsarcopenia-related measures when combined with a vitamin Dsupplement, showing improved LM in the short term ( <12 weeks). Whey protein plus vitamin D co-supplementationincreased LM, muscle strength, and physical function in non-RE supplementation.We hypothesize that this effect was dueto correcting de ﬁcient/insuf ﬁcient vitamin D status.Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the exact mechanismsof action of vitamin D combined with whey protein on sarco-penia measures and muscle protein anabolism, particularly invarious durations or doses.Funding There were no speci ﬁc sources of funding for this work.EAN is a tier 2 Research Productivity Fellow supported by the Bra-zilian National Council for Scienti ﬁc and Technological Devel- opment (CNPq) (grant number 308584/2019-8).SMP is a tier 1 Canada Research Chair and acknowledges the funding from that agency.
