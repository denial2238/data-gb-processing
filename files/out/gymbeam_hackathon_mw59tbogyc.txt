Viruses areacellular parasites andobligately relyonhost cellmachinery forreproduction.Previous studies have indicated metabolomic changes in endothelial cellmodels andsera ofanimal models andpatients withdengue fever.To probe theimmunometabol icmechanism ofDENV infection, here, wereport themetabolo- miclandscape ofahuman macrophage cellmodel ofDENV infection anditsantibody- dependent enhancement.DENV infection ofTHP-1-derived macrophage scaused 202 metabolic variants, ofwhich amino acids occupied 23.7%, fatty acids 21.78%, carbohy- drates 10.4%, organic acids 13.37%, andcarnitines 10.4%.
These metabolomic changes indicated anoverall anabolic signature, which wascharacterized bytheglobal exhaustion ofamino acids, increases ofcellular fatty acids, carbohydrates andpentoses, but decreases ofacylcarnitine. Significant activation ofmetabolic pathways ofglycolysis, pentose phosphate, amino acidmetabolism, andtricarboxylic acidcycle collectively sup- porttheoverall anabolism tomeet metabolic demands ofDENV replication andimmune activation byviralinfection.Totally 88of202metabolic variants were significantly changed byDENV infection, 36ofwhich metthestatistical standard (P<0.05, VIP>1.5) of differentially expressed metabolites, which were thepredominantly decreased variants of acylcarnitine andtheincreased variants offatty acids andcarbohydrates.Remarkably, 11differentially expressed metabolites were significantly distinct between DENV only infection andantibody-dependen tenhancem entofviralinfection.

Our findings revealed ashift towards utilization ofamino acids and increased produc- tion ofcarbohydrates and fatty acids, indicating anoverall boost incellular activity—a sig- nature response tothevirus’s replication demands and immune system activation triggered bytheinfection. Specifically, weidentified 88metabolic changes induced by DENV, with 36showing notable statistical significance, highlighting decreased acylcarni- tine and increased fatty acids and carbohydrates asprominent alterations.Importantly, ourstudy identified 11distinct metabolites significantly different between DENV infec- tion alone and itsenhancement byantibodies.These results strongly suggest that thevirus notonly facilitates itsreplication butalso orchestrates anabolic processes that integrate viral growth with thehost immune responses.
Understanding these metabolic dynamics during DENV infection could offer valuable insights forpotential therapeutic interventions incombating thisprevalent and impactful disease. Introduction Dengue fever isthemost prevalent arthropod-transmitted viral disease worldwide and the incidence hasrisen sharply inrecent decades [1].Over thepast 20years, thenumber ofdengue cases reported toWHO hasincreased more than eightfold, approximately 3.9billion people in 129countries areatriskofdengue virus (DENV) infection with 70% oftheinfected population inAsia [2,3].DENV isthecausative agent ofdengue fever and contains 4different serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2 DENV-3, and DENV-4).They naturally infect mononuclear phagocyte lineage including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) [4,5] viathecell-surface mole- cules orreceptors.
Their infection causes disease symptoms ranging from dengue fever (DF), a form ofself-limited febrile illness, todengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syn- drome (DSS) [6].Viral virulence isanimportant riskfactor forsevere disease, and certain DENV-2 and DENV-3 genotypes aremore often associated with DHF [7–10], inparticular, theSoutheast Asia genotype ofDENV-2 replicates tohigher titers inhuman macrophages and DCs [11,12] and may lead toincreased viral pathogenicity inhumans [9]. Primary infection ofasingle serotype ofDENV tends tocause mild dengue fever, while the secondary infection with aheterotypic DENV serotype wasfound tobeassociated with severe dengue disease.The mechanism ofsevere dengue disease isnotfully understood and iscur- rently hypothesized byextrinsic and intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) theo- ries.
The extrinsic ADE theory states that antibodies produced during primary DENV infection cross-bind tosecondary infected heterologous dengue viruses toform aviral anti- gen-antibody complex that facilitates virus entry bybinding toIgG Fcγreceptor (FcγR) onthe PLOS NEGL ECTED TRO PICAL DIS EASESMetabolic profile ofDENV-infe ctedmacropha ge PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease s|https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pn td.00119 23February 2,2024 2/21roleinstudy design, dataanalysis andmanus cript preparation. Competing interests :Theauthors have declared thatnocompeting interests exist.cellsurface, resulting inhigh viral load infection that aggravates disease severity.The intrinsic ADE theory suggests that FcγR-mediated viral infection modulates intracellular immune effec- tors that promote virus replication and release [13,14].
Furthermore, antibody-dependent DENV infection activates intracellular signaling pathways distinct from canonical receptor- mediated endocytosis, increasing theexpression ofhost dependency factors associated with RNA splicing, mitochondrial respiratory chain function, intracellular vesicle transport rate, and ribosome gene expression [15,16]. Viral infection induces anintegrative process ofinnate and adaptive immune responses that couples metabolism interms ofenergy support and building blocks supply [17].Metabo- lites yielded incellular metabolism arethebiochemical footprints capable ofrevealing thestate ofthecellinaspecific time frame, and themetabolomics analysis isoneoftheapproaches to disclose metabolite alternations and dissect intracellular molecular mechanisms ofpathophysi- ological activities.
Since thefirst metabolomic study onserum samples from patients with pri- mary DENV infection in2013 [18], several metabolomics studies have been performed on various samples ofcellmodel [19] and animal model [20] ofDENV infection and samples of patients with DF,DHF and/or DSS [21–24] toexplore metabolic mechanism, diagnostic bio- markers, and druggable metabolic targets ofDENV infections. Although themetabolomic findings vary indifferent studies duetothedifferences incelltype, disease stage, genetic and nutrition background, themajorly altered metabolites were identified asfree fatty acids, acyl- carnitine, phospholipids, amino acids, purines, pyrimidine, bileacids from different metabolic pathways, particularly thelipid metabolic pathways.Despite several previous metabolomics studies onDENV infection, little isknown about thealterations occurring inintracellular metabolic pathways inhuman immune cells during DENV infection.
Particularly, human monocytes and macrophages, which arethemain targets ofnatural DENV infections, play acentral role during DENV immunopathogenesis, aswell as host anti-viral immunity [25–28]. Elucidating thecomprehensive metabolic changes inmono- cytes/macrophages may shed light ontheimmunometabolic mechanisms involved inimmune cellresponsiveness upon DENV infection.Toprobe theimmunometabolic mechanism ofDENV infection, wethus studied themeta- bolomic profiles ofDENV infection inimmune cells using ahuman monocytic cellmodel of DENV infection under non-ADE and ADE conditions.The general outcomes disclosed an anabolic signature ofdengue virus infection, which isevidenced bytheincreases inlipid bio- synthesis, carbohydrates, and pentoses and theexhaustion ofamino acids and acylcarnitine.
Materials andmethods Cells and virus THP-1 cells were grown inRoswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI-1640, Gibco, NY, USA) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Auckland, New Zealand), 50U/ml penicillin and 50μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, NY, USA) at 37˚C with 5%CO 2.THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages byincubation with 100ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for48h.DENV-2 (strain 16681, pro- vided byDr.Claire Huang, Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, Ft.Collins, CO, USA) wasgrown inC6/36Aedesalbopictus cells and titrated onVero cells byafocus-forming assay.
DENV infection inmacrophages ForDENV only infection (non-ADE), DENV-2 wasadded toTHP-1-derived macrophages (MOI =20)for2h.Infected cells were then washed once and cultured inRPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for24h.Cells were detached from plates byEDTA treatment and PLOS NEGL ECTED TRO PICAL DIS EASESMetabolic profile ofDENV-infe ctedmacropha ge PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease s|https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pn td.00119 23February 2,2024 3/21 washed with PBS forfurther metabolomic analysis (sixreplicates). ForADE infection, the heat-inactivated convalescent serum from apatient with DENV-3 infection wasdiluted at 1:4000 and then incubated with thesame volume ofDENV-2 (6×107PFU/ml) for1hatroom temperature.The virus/serum mixture wassubsequently added toTHP-1-derived macro- phages (MOI =20)for2hat37˚C.Infected cells were then washed once and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for24hat37˚C.
Cells were collected forfur- ther analysis ofmetabolome profiles (sixreplicates). Todetect DENV infectivity, infected cells were collected and fixed with 4%PFA.Viral replication wasevaluated byintracellular staining with DENV-2 NS1 immunized mouse serum [29] for30min at4˚C, followed byincubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated toAlexa Fluor 568(Abcam, Cambridge, UN) foranother 30min at4˚C.The percentage ofinfected cells wasdetermined byflow cytometry using an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo software version 10.4.Targeted metabolomics quantification The targeted metabolomics quantification analysis wasperformed using Q300 Kit(Metabo- Profile, Shanghai, China) according toadetailed procedure [30].The Q300 kitdetects multiple trans-quantitative metabolites such asamino acids, phenols, phenyl orbenzyl derivatives, indoles, organic acids, fatty acids, sugars andbileacids inbiological samples onthesame micro- titer plate.
This kitadopts L_Arginine_15N2, Hippuric acid_D5, TCDCA_D9, D_Glucose_D7, Carnitine_D3, C50_D9, Citric acid_D4, one-to-one standard, andother internal standards. The method hasbeen patented (CN109298115B), published [30], andcited byother studies [31–33].Tovalidate thestability andreproducibility ofthechromatographic separation oflow concentrations ofmetabolites that may have large coefficient ofvariation (CV) values, weper- formed Principal component analysis (PCA) onquality control (QC) samples atthesame time, thefirst principal component (PC1) results indicated overall stable oftheQC(S1Fig).Chemicals and preparation ofstock solutions.Metabolite compound standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA), Steraloids Inc.(Newport, RI,USA) andTRC Chemicals (Toronto, ON, Canada).
The stock solution foreach compound wasprepared bydis- solving theindividual standard inwater, methanol, sodium hydroxide, orhydrochloric acid ata concentration of5.0mg/mL, andcalibration stock solution wasmade bymixing appropriate amount ofeach stock solution. Optima LC/MS grade formic acid wasobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA), andOptima LC/MS grade methanol, acetonitrile, andisopropanol were pur- chased from Thermo-Fisher Scientific (FairLawn, NJ,USA).Ultrapure water wasproduced bya Mill-Q Reference system equipped with aLC-MS Pakfilter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).Metabolite extraction.About 5×106cells ofeach sample insafelock Eppendorf tube were mixed with pre-chilled zirconium oxide beads in20μLofdeionized water and were homoge- nized for3min.Metabolites were extracted byadding 150μLofmethanol containing internal standard and homogenizing foranother 3min, thehomogenate wascentrifugated at18000 g for20min.
The supernatant wastransferred toa96-well plate and subjected tofollowing pro- cedures onanEppendorf epMotion Workstation (Eppendorf Inc., Humburg, Germany): 20μLoffreshly prepared derivative reagents were added toeach well, then, 96-well plate was sealed, derivatized at30˚C for60min, evaporated for2h,and reconstituted byadding 330μL ofice-cold 50% methanol. The plate wasthen cold-down at-20˚C for20min and followed by 4000 gcentrifugation at4˚C for30min.135μLofsupernatant wastransferred toanew 96-well plate with 10μLinternal standards ineach well.Serial dilutions ofderivatized stock standards were added toblank wells, and theplate wassealed forLC-MS analysis within 48h.UPLC-MS/MS quantitative analysis ofmetabolites.

Acomprehensive setofrigorous quality control/assurance (QC/QA) procedures wasemployed toensure aconsistently high quality of analytical results, including quality controls ofthetestmixtures, internal standards, pooled biological samples, conditioning samples, and solvent blank samples.The cellsamples were analyzed inrandom group pairs, together with QCsamples, calibrators, and blank samples, to diminish analytical bias.Metabolite concentration insamples wasdetermined bycalibration curve ofstandard samples.
Forquality control ofmetabolomic analysis, thetestmixtures ofstandards with amass pro- filecovering themass range used forsample analysis were analyzed atthebeginning andendof each batch runtoensure instrument performance within laboratory specifications (retention time stability, chromatographic peak shape, andpeak signal intensity). The retention time shift waswithin 4secandthedifference ofpeak intensity waswithin 15% forLC-MS.The internal standards were added tothetestsamples inorder tomonitor analytical variations during the entire sample preparation andanalysis processes.The pooled QCsamples were prepared by mixing aliquots ofthestudy samples andwere injected atregular intervals (after every 14test samples forLC-MS) throughout theanalytical run.Reagent blank samples were themixture of solvents used forsample preparation andwere also used towash thecolumn andremove cumu- lative matrix effects throughout thestudy.
The calibrators consisted ofablank sample (matrix sample without internal standard), azero sample (matrix sample with internal standard), anda series ofseven concentrations covering theexpected range forthemetabolites incellsamples. The lower limit ofquantification (LLOQ) andtheupper limit ofquantification (ULOQ) were thelowest andhighest concentrations ofthestandard curve that were measured with acceptable accuracy andprecision using Q300 Kit[30] asdescribed above.Inbrief, theaccuracy ofquanti- tation wasassessed bydetermining therecoveries ofstandard metabolites, andrecovery ranging from 80% to120% andCVlessthan 15% wasdefined asacceptable accuracy.Allmetabolite concentration wasnormalized aspmol/million cells.Statistics The rawdata generated byUPLC-MS/MS were processed forpeak integration, calibration, and quantitation using MassLynx software (v4.1, Waters, Milford, MA, USA).
The multivari- atestatistical analyses including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least square dis- criminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), random forest, and support vector machine learning and theunivariate statistical analyses including student t-test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (U-test), ANOVA, and correlation analysis were performed byiMAP platform (v1.0; MetaboProfile, Shanghai, China). The vari- able importance inprojection (VIP) wasobtained based ontheOPLS-DA model, and metabo- lites with VIP�1and Pvalue<0.05 (univariate analyses were based onwhether thedata were normally distributed) were determined asstatistically significant.The Z-Score, also known as thestandard score, wasused todetermine how many standard deviations anentity isaway from themean ofthecontrol group.
Arbitrary fold change (FC) cut-offs of>2and significance p-values of<0.05 were used tojudge thesignificant difference ofdifferentially expressed metabolites. Toinvestigate thebiological meaning ofdifferentially expressed metabolites, metabolite-associated pathway enrichment analysis wasperformed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 with KEGG(Kyoto Encyclopedia ofGenes and Genomes)database [34].Athreshold of p<0.05 wasused forconsidering thefunction orpathway tobeimpactful.Pvalues were determined bytwodifferent pathway analysis methods: thehypergeometric test[35] and the pathway impact value [36].

This celllineissusceptible toDENV infection, and also expresses FcγRI and FcγRII onthecellsurface [40], representing asuitable cell-based model forDENV and ADE infections.The cellmodel ofDENV only infection (non-ADE) and ADE infection wasestablished as schemed inFig1A.Intracellular viral antigens were stained with anti-DENV NS1 antibody and were analyzed byflow cytometry.
Incomparison with themock-infected cells (Fig 1B), theDENV-2 only infection resulted inacellinfection rate of39.3% (Fig 1C), while inthepres- ence ofantiserum (ADE), infected cells were increased upto69.4% (Fig 1D), which wasabout twice ashigh asvirus only infection. Overview ofmetabolic changes ofdengue virus infection Intracellular metabolomic changes after virus-free (control), DENV-2 only infection (non- ADE), orADE infection (DENV-2-antiserum complex) were quantitatively analyzed byultra- high liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Atotal of202altered metabolites were detected, ofwhich were amino acids (23.76%), fatty acids (21.78%), organic acids (13.37%), carbohydrates (10.4%), and carnitines (10.4%) (Fig 2Aand S1Table).
Metabolite class statistics showed that amino acid contents displayed themost metabolite detection fre- quency (62.17%), which wasfollowed bycarbohydrates (18.53%), organic acids (10.51%), Fig1.THP-1 derived macroph agecellmodel forDENV and ADE infections.

12ofthe18varied pathways were shared bynon-ADE and ADE infections, therest6varied pathways were specific tonon-ADE infection, which were beta-alanine metab- olism, pentose phosphate pathway, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (Fig 2F). The differences inmetabolic pathways may distinguish metabolic prediction ofnon- ADE from ADE infections.Among thechanged metabolic pathways, theanabolic pathways ofaminoacyl-tRNA (P=1.86E-05) and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (P=8.07E-05) were themost significant, highlighting theanabolism ofviral proteins (Fig 2E).
Other highly activated meta- bolic pathways were glycolysis that supports energy demand during infection process, thepen- tose phosphate pathway, abranch oftheglycolysis that provides ribose fornucleic acid synthesis, and thetricarboxylic acid cycle reactions that converges aerobic oxidation ofmeta- bolic substrates (sugars, fatty acids and amino acids), aswell asthemutual transformation between intermediate metabolites, which iscrosslinked with metabolism pathways ofamino acids, glucose, and fatty acids. Ingeneral, allthese metabolites change collectively accord with ahighly anabolic response toDENV infection.Dengue virus infection significantly consumes cellular amino acids Asindicated inFig2E,enrichment analysis ofpathways reveals arelatively numerous enrich- ment ofamino acid pathways, including essential amino acids such asvaline, leucine, isoleu- cine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and histidine.This suggests that amino acids have a substantial impact.
DENV infection changed thecellular contents of48amino acids and their derivatives (Fig 3A), 20ofwhich reached significant (fold change (FC)>2,P<0.05) including 16decreases inDENV only infection, 10decreases and 3increases inADE infection (Fig 3B). These significant variants included 8essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine), 3conditionally non-essential amino acids (arginine, serine, and tyrosine), 1non-essential amino acids (alanine), and 8amino acid derivatives (4-hydroxyproline, acetylglycine, creatine, GABA, kynurenine, methylcysteine, N-acetyaspartic acid, and sarcosine).Among them, 7variants were specifically produced by DENV only, 4byADE, and 9were co-produced byboth DENV only and ADE infections (Fig 3C).Most oftheir contents were significantly reduced, except that 3(4-hydroxyproline, lysine, and methylcysteine) were elevated byADE infection (S3Fig).
Dengue virus infection generally increases cellular carbohydrate contents Both non-ADE and ADE ofDENV infections resulted in23carbohydrate variants (Fig 4A) and significantly co-produced 13variants (FC>2, P<0.05), including one12-carbon com- pound (melibiose), four 6-carbon compounds (glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose, and fructose 6-phosphate), four 5-carbon compounds (ribulose, ribose 5-phosphate, xylulose, xylose), and four 3-carbon compounds (glyceraldehyde, glyceric acid, pyruvate, and lactic acid) (Fig 4Band 4C). The contents ofglyceric acid, pyruvate, lactic acid and melibiose were significantly decreased, whereas, theothers were significantly increased.These variants arethe primary components ofglycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (Figs 4Dand S4).

The rest17variants were produced byboth non-ADE and ADE infections (Fig 5C). Remarkably, 6shared variants (adrenic acid, arachidonate, dihomo-gamma-linole- nate, DHA, DPA, and EPA) participate inthepathway ofunsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis, and allwere increased.Among theDENV only infection-specific variants, except for2-methy- 4-pentenoic acid, theother 4variants were significantly increased (FC>2, P<0.05).However, among the6ADE-specific variants, 3were significantly decreased (decanoic acid, octanoic acid, tridecanoic acid) and other 3were increased (S5Fig).Dengue virus infection significantly reduces cellular acylcarnitine contents Carnitine isanon-essential amino acid and aquaternary ammonium compound, and itsfatty acid ester acylcarnitine plays akeyrole inlipid β-oxidation.DENV infection ledto21carnitine variants, ofthem 14carnitine variants were significant (FC>2,P<0.05) (Fig 6A).

One variant (methylmalonylcarnitine) wasspecific toDENV only infection, while twovariants (dodecanoylcarnitine and valerylcarnitine) were specific toADE infection (Fig 6C). The content ofDENV only infection-produced methylma- lonylcarnitine wassignificantly decreased, whereas, thecontent ofADE infection-produced dodecanoylcarnitine wasreduced butvalerylcarnitine wasincreased (S6Fig).The general reduction ofcarnitine contents indicates inhibition offatty acid catabolism that supports lipid anabolism tomeet theneed ofactive viral replications.Effect ofdengue virus infection oncellular organic acid contents Intracellular organic acids aremetabolic intermediates ofvarious metabolic substrates (carbo- hydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids).DENV infection produced 27variants oforganic acids, 17ofthem reached significant (FC>2,P<0.05), including 8decreased and 9increased vari- ants (Figs 7Aand S7).
DENV only infection induced significant decreases in6and increases in9variants (including hydroxypropionic acid, glutaric acid, aconitic acid, acetoacetic acid, citric acid, isocitric acid, oxalic acid, oxoglutaric acid, and malonic acid), three ofthem (aconi- ticacid, citric acid, and isocitric acid) hadasimilar degree ofincrease; whereas, ADE infection resulted insignificant decreases in7and increases in7variants (Fig 7B). Among thesignifi- cantly changed variants, 3(hydroxypropionic acid, malonic acid, and guanidoacetic acid) were generated byDENV only infection, 2variants (alpha-ketoisovaleric acid and 3-methyl-2-oxo- pentanoic acid) byADE infection, and 12(acetoacetic acid, aconitic acid, citric acid, glutaric acid, isocitric acid, ketoleucine, lactic acid, methylmalonic acid, oxalic acid, 2-oxoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, succinic acid) were shared byboth DENV only and ADE infections (Fig 7C).Fig4.Dengue virus infection general lyincrease scellular carbohydrate contents.

Remarkably, thechanges ofAMP and GMP contents have physiological significance, they areoneofthecellular energy statuses aswell assignaling molecules. Their reduction in response tonon-ADE orADE DENV infection indicates ahigher cellular energy status and alternations ofseveral signaling pathways that govern many cellular physiological events such asmetabolism, protein synthesis, secretion, calcium homeostasis, and gene transcription.For example, thelowcellular level ofAMP, i.e.,ahigh ATP/AMP ratio, inhibits AMPK signaling butactivates PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which collectively activate mTOR signaling path- way topromote protein synthesis (Fig 8D).Differentially expressed metabolites ofdengue virus infection Inorder toidentify thedifferential metabolites with diagnostic significance, thevariants with p<0.05 insingle-dimensional tests and variable projection importance (VIP)>1.5 inmultidi- mensional statistics were selected asdifferentially expressed metabolites.
According tothissta- tistic standard, totally 36variants were differentially expressed metabolites inDENV infection, 11ofthem were decreased and 25were increased (S2Table). Todistinguish non-ADE from ADE infection, thedecrease incaproic acid and increases inribose 5-phosphate, TCDCA, and xylose were specifically differentially expressed metabolites inDENV only infection.Whereas, thedecreases inbutyric acid, SAH, 9E-tetradecenoic acid and theincreases innicotinic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and DPA were specifically differentially expressed metabolites inADE infection (Fig 9A).The elevated metabolic markers were mainly fatty acids and carbo- hydrates, while thereduced metabolic markers were mainly carnitines (Fig 9Band 9C).Discussion Although viruses differ greatly between species and category, they areobligate intracellular pathogens and must depend onmetabolic processes ofhost cells forreproduction.

Inaddition, they arekeyprecursors forsyntheses ofhor- mones and low-molecular weight nitrogenous substances such aspurines, pyrimidines, coen- zymes, and thebiogenic amines [41], and each ofthem isbiologically important. Amino acids arealso thecellsignaling molecules, and their changes inconcentration aretimely sensed by mTOR complex, which isthecheckpoint molecule oftheanabolism signaling pathway [42,43].The global consumption ofcellular amino acids prompts biosynthesis ofaminoacyl-tRNA that supports protein anabolism ofDENV infection.Importantly, degradation oftheessential amino acid tryptophan produces immunosuppressive intermediates, such askynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid, facilitating theimmune escape ofviral infections [23,44,45].Secondly, theincrease inlevels ofcellular fatty acids indicated anactive lipid biosynthesis.Fatty acids play awide range ofphysiological roles [46].
They arenotonly oneofthemajor sources ofcellular fuelandenergy storage, butalso theprecursors ofhormones andlipids to participate inbiological signaling pathways. Ofparticular importance isthat fatty acids arethe constituents ofplasma membrane [18,21,47,48], making them necessary forreplication cycle of dengue virus.Pharmacologically targeting host lipid synthesis caninhibit viral replication [49].Remarkably, thepolyunsaturated fatty acids contributed over 60% ofthesignificant variants of fatty acids during DENV only andADE infections, andmost ofthem areinvolved inthepath- way ofunsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis tomeet thedemands oftheactive biosynthesis of viral envelope.Inaddition, carnitine isanon-essential amino acid andaquaternary ammonium compound.Itsfatty acid ester acylcarnitine plays akeyrole inlipid metabolism andtransfer cytosolic fatty acids into mitochondria bycarnitine palmitoyltransferase 1,which istherate- limiting step offatty acid β-oxidation [50].
Significant decreases inshort-, medium- andlong- chain fatty acid-esterified carnitines indicate therepression offatty acid catabolism, leading to theaccumulation ofcellular fatty acids. The importance oflipid biosynthesis inmaintenance of dengue viral replication hasalso been highlighted inmosquito vector cells [51].Thirdly, thegeneral increase inlevels ofcellular carbohydrates inferred their active metabo- lism.Carbohydrates arecatabolized viaglycolysis and pentose phosphorylation pathways (PPP).The aerobic glycolysis ofcarbohydrates produces energy tomeet theneed ofanabolism [52] and hasbeen significantly involved indengue virus infection [53].Through thePPP path- way, thebreakdown ofcarbohydrates produces precursors necessary forthebiosynthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, one-carbon units, reducing molecules, and antioxidants [54].This process ispivotal inanabolism and serves asametabolic biomarker forviral pathogenesis [55].
However, therole ofthepentose phosphate pathway varies with viral species, probably dueto their difference insensitivity tooxidative stress; forexample, itpromotes influenza virus but inhibits DENV and SARS-CoV-2 viral replications [56–58]. Finally, dengue viral infection dominantly activates metabolically anabolic pathways.In addition totheabove-described glycolysis and PPP pathways, which provide energy, building blocks and antioxidants foranabolism, other activated metabolic pathways include thepath- ways foramino acid catabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and tri- carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which isanessential metabolic network that connects aerobic metabolism ofcarbohydrate, fat,and protein (amino acid) [59].The dynamics ofthemetabolic intermediates ofTCA cycle reflect fluctuations ofintracellular metabolic pathways during den- guevirus infection.

The current immunometabolic concept hasbeen advanced tostate theintersec- tion between immunology and biochemistry bywhich metabolic pathways regulate immune cellgrowth, differentiation and function [61].
Pathogen infection triggers ananabolic cytokine storm response through Toll-like receptors (TLR)-mediated immune activation and simulta- neously reprograms metabolism byactivating glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, which provide immune cytokine storm with energy and building materials forbiosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins [62]. Distinct from bacterial infection, viral infection relies onthe activation ofanabolic pathways inhost cells forviral replications.Thus, theanabolic feature of macrophages integrates theviral production and immune activation against viral infection.Usually, thesignificant metabolic variants have clinical significance ofdiagnosis and predic- tion ofoutcomes.
Although theexvivo study isnotsuitable toexplore clinically related bio- markers, based onthestatistical standard ofp<0.05 and VIP>1.5, 36variants from carbohydrate, fat,and carnitine metabolism met thestandard asdifferentially expressed metabolites, and 11variants displayed between thenon-ADE from ADE infection ofdengue virus. However, their diagnostic and disease progression predictive significance needs tobe validated infuture clinical studies.The disturbed metabolic profile ofmonocyte/macrophage byDENV infection inthecur- rent study ismostly consistent with previous studies onserum ofdengue fever patients and humanized mice model ofdengue infection [18,20–22], which displayed anoverall decrease inlevels ofamino acids and increase inlevels offatty acids include polyunsaturated fatty acids.These common metabolic changes inexvivo andinvivo settings may benecessary to meet themetabolic demands ofviral replication and host defense response.
However, the exceptions were that DNEV infection ofmonocytes/macroph ages induced aglobal reduc- tion ofacylcarnitines rather than theincrease inserum metabolomics ofdengue fever patients, and that thepatient serum studies consistently showed active phospholipid catabo- lism, which didnotshow upinthecurrent study onmonocyte/macrophages. The metabolic dissimilarity may beattributed tothefact that changes inserum contents refract theorches- trated response ofmultiple organ systems including theimmune system and thecentral metabolic organs liver and muscle.Theseinvivo studies have associated themetabolic changes with vital organ dysfunctions, disease development phases and severity, and were restorable upon disease recovery.Insummary, thecurrent study disclosed ananabolism signature ofdengue viral infection inmacrophages, highlighting theintegration ofimmune system and metabolism during the process ofviral infection.
However, ourstudy met limitations tovalidate thefindings viain vivo experiments duetothelack ofsuitable animal models ofDENV-ADE infection inimmu- nocompetent mice. Inaddition, patients with different serotypes ofDENV infection indeed displayed different metabolic changes [24], thus themetabolic profiles ofimmune cells bydif- ferent serotypes ofDENV infection should beclarified infuture studies.Supporting information S1Fig.Multivariate Control Chart.The PC1 results indicated overall stable oftheQC.The horizontal coordinate istheorder inwhich allsamples were tested, and thevertical coordinate isthePC1 scores.Each black dotinthegraph represents asample, and yellow dots represent quality control samples.(TIF) PLOS NEGL ECTED TRO PICAL DIS EASESMetabolic profile ofDENV-infe ctedmacropha ge PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease s|https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pn td.00119 23February 2,2024 16/21 S2Fig.The proportion ofvarious metabolites bymetabolite class statistic analysis.(TIF) S3Fig.
