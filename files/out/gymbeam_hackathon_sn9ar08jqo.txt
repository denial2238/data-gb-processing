Cooked samples were mixed with ferric iron and either extracted with acid or digested with pepsin and pancreatin.

Iron absorption can be influenced by a variety of dietarycomponents but it is well accepted that the most effectiveenhancers of absorption are ascorbic acid and muscle tissue[2,3]. The effect of muscle has become known as the ‚Äúmeat factor.‚Äù The mechanism of the meat effect remains controversial even after decades of research, largely with in vitrosys- tems.Much research suggests that peptides, derived fromenzymatic digestion of muscle proteins, chelate iron thatwould otherwise be insoluble in the upper intestine.In vitro studies have indicated that cysteine and histidine residuesin peptides could act as iron chelators [ 4‚Äì6].Peptides could also reduce ferric iron to the more soluble and bioavailableferrousformthroughtheactionofcysteineresidues[ 7].Both ofthesemechanismscanleadtoincreasedlevelsofdialyzableiron.Some studies have suggested that a nonprotein muscle componentmaybeinvolved[ 8].
A l lr e s e a r c hi n v o l v i n gh u m a ns u b j e c t s( a n dm o s to ft h e in vitrostudies) have used cooked meat or fish as the source material.However,theeffectofcooking persehasreceivedlit- tleattentiondespitetheknowledgethatheatcausesoxidation ofmuscleproteinsulfhydryls[ 9]a ndtha tsulfh y drylsa r ethe structures most often thought to be responsible for the meat effect. We have already shown that heating a homogenized, stirred, muscle slurry in a water bath reduced formation ofdialyzable iron [ 10].However, those data cannot be used to estimate the effects of cooking intact tissue portions.Cooking is a more complex physical phenomenon than simply heating a slurry since it involves severe temperature gradients, dehydration reactions, browning reactions, andvarying alterations in protein structure.
Since it is the only practical way of consuming meat, it is important that its effect(s)beevaluatedandunderstood.Hindawi Publishing Corporation International Journal of Food Science Volume 2014, Article ID 345751, 6 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/345751 2 InternationalJournalofFoodScience Accordingly, we have investigated the effects of cooking on the production of iron binding components during bothextractionanddigestion.Sincecookingmethodsvarybothint e m p e r a t u r ea n di nt h em e t h o do fh e a t i n g ,w eh a v es t u d i e dtheeffectsofcookingchickenbreastmusclebyfourdifferentprocedures, to a common internal temperature of 165 ‚àòF (74‚àòC), generally accepted as ‚Äúdone.‚Äù We used chicken breast asasourceofmuscleduetoitslowendogenousironcontent.We used dialyzable iron as an indicator of iron species thatmay be bioavailable.
Dialyzable iron correlates well withhumanbioavailabilityinsystemssuchasthese,whereorganicacids that chelate iron but do not promote absorption areabsent[11]. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Materials.Skinless, boneless chicken breast, chilled but notfrozen,wasobtainedfromalocalsupermarket.Dialysis membranes were from Spectrum Labs, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA.For digestions to measure dialyzableiron, Spectra/Por 1 membranes with a diameter of 20.4mmandmolecularweightcutoff(MWCO)of6‚Äì8kDawereused.All membranes were soaked in 5mM EDTA for 2hrs andrinsedseveraltimeswithdistilled,deionizedwaterbeforeuse.Pepsin (P 7012), pancreatin (P 1750), bile extract, PIPES buffer, 5,5 Û∏Ä†dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), and ferrozine were fromSigmaChemical(St.Louis,MOUSA).Ironreferencesolutioncontaining 1000ppm ferric iron was from Fisher Chemical,Fairlawn, NJ.All other chemicals were of reagent grade.Distilled,deionizedwaterwasusedthroughout.2.2.Sample Preparation.
After trimming to remove visible fat, a single chicken breast was divided into portions of ‚àº100g of muscle, each 7-8cm in diameter. A portion of raw chicken was chopped into small pieces of about 4mm 3.The chopped sample was then packed in an airtight bagand stored at‚àí40 ‚àòC.The other portions were cooked to an internal temperature of 165‚àòF( 7 4‚àòC), as measured by a probe, by one of the following four procedures.Boiling: theportion was heated in boiling water.Baking: the portionw a sh e a t e do nag l a s sb a k i n gs h e e ti na no v e ns e ta t3 6 5 ‚àòF and turned over every ten minutes to ensure even heating.Saut¬¥eing:aportionwasplacedinthreetablespoonsofcanola oil heated to a temperature of ‚â•400 ‚àòFi nas t a i n l e s ss t e e l pan; the portion was turned over every ten minutes.

Fried samples were then patted with paper towels to remove excess oil and then dipped in hexane to remove further surface oil.Once cold,sampleswereweighedandgroundinaspiceblendertoasize of‚àº2-3mm 3.Allsampleswereindividuallywellmixedanda portion was analyzed for protein content using the Kjeldahlmethod[12].Thesampleswerepackedinanair-tightbagand storedfrozenat‚àí40 ‚àòC.2.3.Methods.All glassware was soaked in 2N HCl and then rinsedseveraltimeswithdistilled,deionizedwaterbeforeuse.2.3.1.Digestions.The digestion procedure was based on the methodoriginallydescribedbyMilleretal.[ 13]andincluded modifications designed to reduce the amount of extraneousiron and control the final pH.
The details of the procedurehavealreadybeendescribed[ 14]. Aportionofthawedchickenmusclecontaining2.0gpro- tein was homogenized in 80mL water for 3 minutes, in one- minute bursts.After addition of ferric iron (37.5 ùúámoles/2g protein) and adjustment to pH 2 at 37 ‚àòC, the samples were digested at 37‚àòC with pepsin (pH 2) for 2 hours.Adjustment of pH after the pepsin digestion was made with a dialysisbag (6‚Äì8kDa MWCO) containing sufficient NaHCO 3to neutralize the titratable acidity [ 14].This was followed by digestion with pancreatin/bile/PIPES buffer (pH 6.5) foranother 2 hours, as previously described [ 14].The final pH afterpancreatindigestionwas6.5 ¬±0.1.2.3.2.Controls.An iron-only control was run using the procedures described above but using water in place of thechickensample.2.3.3.Extractions.
Extracted (nondigested) samples were prepared with chicken muscle and iron using the proceduredescribed under Section2.3.1 but with omitting the prote- olyticenzymes.Accordingly,thesamplewasextractedatpH2 for two hours and then partially neutralized with sodiumbicarbonate and then extracted for 2hrs to reach a final pHof 6.5¬±0.1. 2.3.4.Analysis.After the digestion procedure, the dialyzate and retentate were centrifuged at 1.750 √ógf o r1 0 m i nt o remove insoluble iron.Aliquots of the supernatants con-taining soluble iron were mixed 1:1 with reducing proteinprecipitant and separately 1:1 with nonreducing proteinprecipitant [ 14] and then left overnight.The next day the samples were centrifuged again to remove insoluble protein.Thefinalsupernatantswereanalyzedforproteinandiron.Protein was measured by the Biuret method [ 15]u s i n g bovineserumalbuminasastandard.
Total and ferrous iron was measured spectrophotomet- rically with ferrozine as previously described [ 14]u s i n ga standard curve generated using FeC1 3(0‚Äì5mg/mL) in the presenceofhydroxylaminehydrochloride. Total sulfhydryls and histidine content were measured spectrophotometrically after protein denaturation as previ-ouslydescribed[ 10].Nonprotein sulfhydryls were determined by homogeniz- ing muscle samples containing 2.0g protein with 100mLcold 0.01N HCl containing 0.01mM EDTA for 5min.Thehomogenate was centrifuged at 3000 √ógf o r1 0m i na n dt h e supernatantwascollected.Adialysistube(6‚Äì8kDaMWCO)containing 20mL 0.01N HCl, 0.01mM EDTA, was placedi nt h es u p e r n a t a n ta n dd i a l y s i sw a sa l l o w e dt oc o n t i n u ef o r4 h ra t4 ‚àòC in a shaking Erlenmeyer flask.

ferrous iron species; the ferric is likely to be chelated, while thelattermusthavebeenreducedbymusclecomponents. Dialyzable iron levels after extraction were lower for all cooking methods.However, the values were still greaterthanthecontrol,indicatingthatcookinghadnotcompletelydestroyedthemusclecomponentsresponsible.Thenatureof InternationalJournalofFoodScience 5 these components is uncertain but they must be heat labile andsome,atleast,musthavereducingpower.Earlierreportssuggestthatglutathione[ 17]orglycosaminoglycans[ 8]could function as extractable sources of dialyzable iron.Cookingreducedthelevelsofnonproteinsulfhydryls,whichinmuscleare known to be principally glutathione [ 9], and this could well account for the reduced levels of dialyzable ferrous iron after extraction.After extraction there was little differencein dialyzable iron levels between cooking methods, exceptfor the saut ¬¥eed sample where dialyzable ferrous iron was significantly lower.
The saut ¬¥e e ds a m p l ew a ss u b j e c t e dt ot h e highest external temperature because it was in contact withth ep a ns u rf a c eth a tw a sa bo v e400 ‚àòF; this extreme heat may explainthelowervaluesobserved. The effect of cooking on levels of dialyzable iron after digestionwas even more marked than the effect after extrac- t i o n .Th ed e c r e a s e sa r es u c ht h a td i a l y z a b l ei r o nl e v e l sw e r esimilartotheiron-onlycontrolandindicatethatcookinghadlargelydestroyedtheenhancingeffectofchickenmusclepro-teins.Therewasnosignificantdifferencebetweenremaininglevels of dialyzable iron and remaining levels of dialyzable ferrous iron in the same cooked samples, indicating that essentially all the dialyzable iron was ferrous.This indicatedthat cooking affected components that chelate ferric iron aswellasthosethatreduceferricironandthattheeffectontheformerwasespeciallymarked.

The results show the opposite, whichimplies that the decreased levels of dialyzable iron cannotbe accounted for simply by destruction of those amino acid residues.By comparing the levels of dialyzable iron after digestion with the levels after extraction ,a ss h o w ni n Figure6,i ti s possibleto estimatebydifference thedialyzableironresulting from the proteolytic part of the digestion process.
It is clearthat in the cooked samples the levels of dialyzable iron after extraction anddigestionwereessentiallythesame(themeans differ by less than oneùúág iron) except for the deep fried sample;inthatsampletherewasadifferenceof3 ùúágbutitwas still less than the difference in the iron-only control (5 ùúág).Thiscomparisonindicatesthatwhereasproteolyticdigestion o ft h er a ws a m p l el e dt oal a r g ei n c r e a s ei nd i a l y z a b l ei r o ntherewaslittleornoeffectofdigestioninthecookedsamples;thatis,theeffectwasmostlynegatedbycooking. Levels of dialyzable iron after cooking were very similar forallcookingtreatmentsdespitethedifferencesintempera-turetowhichthesampleswereexposedduringcooking.Thisindicates that the internal temperature reached, which wasthe same for all samples, may be the more important factorindeterminingtheeventuallevelsofdialyzableiron.
The effect of cooking on levels of dialyzable protein variedaccordingtothetreatment.Decreaseddigestionwould lead to decreased levels of peptides and since these may be responsible for iron chelation they could contribute to lower dialyzable iron. However, reduced dialyzable proteinlevels were observed onlyfor thesaut ¬¥eedsample,soitseems unlikely that impaired protein digestion was an important factorfortheothersamples.Ourfindingsfortheeffectofcookingareinclearcontrast to other studies that reported the effect of cooking ondialyzable iron.
Kapsokefalou and Miller [ 18]r e p o r t e dt h a t cooking beef by broiling and microwaving had no effect on dialyzable ferrous iron levels after digestion, whereas we foundamarkedreductionforalltreatments.Theyfoundthat broiling caused a‚àº25% reduction in total dialyzable iron, to levelsthatwerestillsignificantlyhigherthanthecontrol.Wefound that all cooking methods reduced dialyzable iron tolevels that were not different from the control, except for thebakedsamplethatwasslightlyhigher. S√∏rensen et al.[ 19] determined the effect of heating pork meat, at temperatures in the range 60‚Äì120 ‚àòC, on the production of dialyzable ferrous iron from exogenous ferricchloride.They found that increasing heat treatment led toincreased dialyzable ferrous iron after pepsin digestion and suggested that this might be due to increased accessibilityto proteolysis.
However, after a pepsin-pancreatin digestionthey found only very low levels of dialyzable iron in rawmuscleandnoeffectofheattreatment.Incontrast,wefoundhigh levels of dialyzable iron in raw muscle and a markedreductionaftercooking.S√∏rensenetal.[ 19]alsoreportedthat heating pork at 70 ‚àòCa n d9 0‚àòCc a u s e da ni n c r e a s ei nt h i o l groups, whereas we found that all cooking methods causedadecr easeinthiols. 5.Conclusions The dialyzable iron obtained using cooked chicken muscle is derived mostly from dialyzable source molecules that are extractable in acid, but it is markedly reduced compared toraw muscle.Cooking negates the ability of digested muscle proteins to produce iron-binding peptides that contribute to the formation of dialyzable iron, though the mechanismof the heating effect is uncertain.
Consequently, in systems where dialyzable iron is a reasonable proxy for iron bioavail- ability, cooking chicken muscle would markedly reduce the effect of ‚Äúthe meat factor,‚Äù mostly through its negative effect onthemuscleproteins. 6 InternationalJournalofFoodScience Conflict of Interests The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regardingthepublicationofthispaper.Acknowledgment ThismaterialwasbasedonworksupportedbytheCoopera-tiveStateResearch,Extension,EducationService,USDepart-mentofAgriculture,MassachusettsAgriculturalExperimentStation,underProjectno.956.References [1] C.E.Carpenter and A.W.Mahoney, ‚ÄúContributions of heme andnonhemeirontohumannutrition,‚Äù CriticalReviewsinFood ScienceandNutrition ,vol.3 1,no .4,p p .3 3 3‚Äì367 ,1 99 2.[2] E.Bjorn-Rasmussen and L.Hallberg, ‚ÄúEffect of animal pro- teins on the absorption of food iron in man,‚Äù Nutrition and Metabolism ,vol.23,no.3,pp.192‚Äì202,1979.
