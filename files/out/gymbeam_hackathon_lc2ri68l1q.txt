We herebypresent a patient with advanced HIV and disseminatedMAC who developed severe calcitriol-induced hypercalce-mia in the setting of high dose vitamin D supplementation.Case description: A 48-year-old male with advanced HIV (CD4 count <20 cells/mm^3) presented for evaluation of ab- dominal pain and constipation, and was found to have se-vere hypercalcemia of 14.8 mg/dL. Five months prior, hehad restarted anti-retroviral therapy (ART) after having been out of care for over a year and was diagnosed with dis- seminated MAC for which he was on azithromycin and eth-ambutol.Cultures drawn during this admission werenegative for MAC.
Hypercalcemia was possibly due to para-doxical immune reconstitution in ﬂammatory syndrome (IRIS) and with appropriate management his calcium levelrapidly normalized to 9.7 mg/dL and remained stable untilA244 | Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A244 the recent admission. He represented one year later with a calcium level of 13.8 mg/dL with suppressed parathyroid hormone levels, which was refractory to bisphosphonate therapy, therefore was empirically initiated on dexametha-sone.By day 4, his calcium levels improved signi ﬁcantly and was discharged on a taper regimen.Cultures collectedthis admission later revealed ongoing MAC infection, whichraised concern for treatment failure and calcitriol-inducedhypercalcemia.
Calcitriol levels were elevated at 105 pg/mL, which further supported this hypothesis.Additionally, prior to admission he had been prescribedergocalciferol 50,000 units weekly for 8 weeks, after whichhe was transitioned to 2,000 units daily. This likely exacer-bated the calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia by providingsudden availability of substrate, 25-OH vitamin D, for theactivated macrophages.Conclusion: ART has reduced the incidence of opportunistic infections such as MAC, how-ever mortality remains high.Vigilant monitoring for com-plications, particularly life-threatening calcitriol-inducedhypercalcemia and timely use of corticosteroids, is crucial.This case also highlights the need for careful oversight inhigh-dose vitamin D supplementation for individuals withgranulomatous disease and vitamin D dysregulation.
