RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Does long-term creatine supplementation impair kidney function in resistance-trained individuals consuming a high-protein diet?Rebeca Lugaresi1, Marco Leme1, Vítor de Salles Painelli1, Igor Hisashi Murai1, Hamilton Roschel1,2,4, Marcelo Tatit Sapienza3, Antonio Herbert Lancha Junior1and Bruno Gualano1,2* Abstract Background: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of creatine supplementation on kidney function in resistance-trained individuals ingesting a high-protein diet.Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed.The participants were randomly allocated to receive either creatine (20 g/d for 5 d followed by 5 g/d throughout the trial) or placebo for 12 weeks.All of the participants were engaged in resistance training and consumed a high-protein diet (i.e., ≥1.2 g/Kg/d).Subjects were assessed at baseline (Pre) and after 12 weeks (Post).Glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance.
Additionally, blood samples and a 24-h urine collection were obtained for other kidney function assessments. Results: No significant differences were observed for51Cr-EDTA clearance throughout the trial (Creatine: Pre 101.42 ± 13.11, Post 108.78 ± 14.41 mL/min/1.73m2; Placebo: Pre 103.29 ± 17.64, Post 106.68 ± 16.05 mL/min/1.73m2;g r o u px time interaction: F = 0.21, p = 0.64).Creatinine clearance, serum and urinary urea, electrolytes, proteinuria, and albuminuria remained virtually unchanged.Conclusions: A 12-week creatine supplementation protocol did not affect kidney function in resistance-trained healthy individuals consuming a high-protein diet; thus reinforcing the safety of this dietary supplement.
Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01817673 Keywords: Glomerular filtration rate,51Cr-EDTA clearance, Side effects Background Creatine supplementation has been recognized as one of the most efficient dietary supplements capable of increasing muscle strength and lean mass [ 1 ] ,a sw e l la sh i g h - i n t e n s i t y exercise performance [2]. However, the indiscriminateuse of this supplement has raised concerns regarding its safety, especially in relation to kidney function [3].Despite the increasing number of publications show- ing that creatine supplementation may not affect kidney function in humans [4-10], it has been recommendedthat the chronic effects of creatine supplementation should be better examined in some specific populations[3].In this regard, there is an empirical claim that creatine supplementation might pose a risk at those consuming protein in excess.
In fact, there is compelling evidence in-dicating that high-protein diets can accelerate renal deteri- oration in individuals with chronic kidney disease [11], although it is unknown whether this holds true in healthypersons [12]. Resistance-trained practitioners often consume a high- protein diet along with creatine supplements in an attemptto enhance power/strength and lean mass.The alleged “kidney overload ”caused by creatine (and its by-product creatinine) and excessive protein ingestion merits furtherinvestigation.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of creatine supplementation on kidney * Correspondence: gualano@usp.br 1School of Physical Education and Sport - Laboratory of Applied Nutrition and Metabolism, University of Sao Paulo, Av Mello de Moraes, 65, Sao Paulo, SP 05508-030, Brazil 2School of Medicine –Division of Rheumatology, University of Sao Paulo, Av Mello de Moraes, 65, Sao Paulo, SP 05508-030, BrazilFull list of author information is available at the end of the article © 2013 Lugaresi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In most of the previous human studies involving creatine supplementation, kidney function wasassessed via serum creatinine or its derivative equations.However, the spontaneous co nversion of creatine into creatinine [13] may falsely suggest decreased kidneyfunction in creatine-supple mented individuals [8].To overcome this potential drawback, we used a gold standard method - 51Chromium-ethylenediamine tetra- acetic acid (51Cr-EDTA) clearance - to accurately measure glomerular filtration rate in this study.Methods Subjects Young healthy males who regularly engaged in resistance training for at least 1 year and were ingesting a high- protein diet ( ≥1.2 g/Kg/d; which is a usual prescription to resistance-trained practitioners [14]) were eligible to par-ticipate.
The exclusion criteria included: vegetarian diet, use of creatine supplements in the past 6 months, chronic kidney disease, and use of anabolic steroids. The partici-pants were advised to maintain their habitual diet.Partici- pants ’characteristics are presented in Table 1.The study was approved by the Ethical Advisory Committee fromthe School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo.All of the participants signed the informed consent.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov asNCT01817673.Experimental protocol A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between July 2011 and February 2013 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.The participants were randomlyassigned to receive either creatine or placebo in a double- blind fashion.All of the participants continued with their usual resistance training routines throughout the study.The participants were assessed at baseline (Pre) and after 12 weeks (Post).
51Cr-EDTA clearance was performed to measure the glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, bloodsamples and twenty-four-hour urine collection were obtained following a 12-h overnight fasting for kidney function assessments.Dietary intake was assessed by 7-dayfood diaries.The participants were asked to refrain from strenuous physical activity 2 4 h prior to the pre- and post- tests.Food intake was assessed by 7-day food diaries.Thismethod consists of the listing of foods and beverages con- sumed during 7 consecutive days.Energy and macronutri- ents were analyzed by the Dietpro® 5i software (Sao Paulo,Brazil).Creatine supplementation protocol and blinding procedure The creatine group received creatine monohydrate (20 g/dfor 5 d followed by 5 g/d throughout the trial).The pla-cebo group received the same dosage of dextrose.The par- ticipants were advised to consume their supplements preferably along with meals ( e.g., breakfast, lunch, after- noon snack, and dinner).
The supplement packages were coded so that neither the investigators nor the participants were aware of the contents until the completion of theanalyses. In order to verify the purity of the creatine used, a sample was analyzed by high-performance liquid chro- matography (HPLC).This established 99.9% of purity,with no other peaks detected (creatinine, dicyandiamide, and cyclocreatine < 0.01%).51Cr-EDTA clearance After a 24h-protein-restricted diet and a 12-h overnight fasting, the participants were admitted to the clinical re-search center at 7:00 a.m., where they rested in a supine position with an indwelling polyethylene catheter inserted into a cubital vein in both arms.A single dose of 3.7 MBq(100 μCi) of the 51Cr-EDTA tracer, in a volume of 1 ml was injected intravenously in the right arm.The catheter was flushed through with 10 ml of saline.Accuratelytimed 10-ml blood-samples were drawn into a heparinized tube from the opposite arm at 4 and 6 h after the injec- tion.
The plasma disappearance curve was designed usingthe results of these time-points. To measure the radioiso- tope activity, the blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min and 3 ml of plasma was measured in a well-calibrated counter (Genesys Genii ™, LabLogic Systems Inc, Brandon, Florida, USA) for the energy of chromium-51 (320 keV).Each sample, including 3 ml of standardsolution taken as an aliquot from 3.7 MBq (100 μCi) 51Cr-EDTA diluted to 500 mL in saline, was counted for 5 min.
The plasma clearance rate was calculated bythe slope-intercept method w ith a single-compartment model, which assumes that the tracer spreads out im- mediately after injection in its volume of distribution.The Brochner –Mortensen method was used for correcting systematic errors of the slope-intercept technique accor- ding to the following equation: Cl c¼0:9908/C2Clnc−0:001218 /C2Clnc2Table 1 Participants ’characteristics Creatine (n = 12) Placebo (n = 14) Age (years) 24 (3) 27 (5) Height (m) 1.79 (0.08) 1.78 (0.05)Weight (Kg) 80.4 (10.3) 78.4 (12.4)BMI (Kg/m 2) 24.8 (1.6) 24.7 (2.9) Training experience (years) 5 (2) 7 (3)Training frequency (sessions per week)5 (1) 4 (1) Data expressed as mean (standard deviation).Lugaresi et al.

Systematic errors caused by an abnormal radioisotope distributionwere corrected using the Groth method. 51Cr-EDTA clearance was also corrected for 1.73 m2body surface area.The coefficient of variation (CV) for51Cr-EDTA clearance was 9.7%.Blood and urinary analyses Blood samples were obtained from an antecubital vein, following a 12-h overnight fasting.Participants followed their normal diet consumption during the 24-h urinecollection.Urine samples were stored at approximately 4°C.Both blood and urinary measurements were performed in the morning.Creatinine was determinedusing Jaffe ’s kinetic method.Urinary and serum sodium and potassium were assessed by using a flame photom- eter (FP8800, Kruss®, Hamburg, Germany).Urea wasassessed by an UV-kinetic method.Albuminuria was determined by nephelometry and proteinuria was mea- sured through the benzethonium chloride method.
All of the samples were analyzed in duplicate and the CV were 2.0, 2.2, 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 5.3, 24.5, and 16.4% for serum creatinine, serum sodium, serum potassium, serumurea, proteinuria, albuminuria, urinary sodium, and urinary potassium, respectively. Statistical analysis It was determined that 24 participants is necessary to provide 80% power (5% significance, two-tailed) to de-tect a 20% reduction in the 51Cr-EDTA clearance.In order to account for mid-trial withdrawals, we enlarged our study sample size to 46 participants.Data were tested by a Mixed Model with Kenward- Roger adjustment for unbalanced group sizes, using the software SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Group (creatine and placebo) and time (Pre and Post) were considered as fixed factors and participants were defined as a random factor.A post hoc test adjusted byTukey was planned to be used whenever a significant F-value was detected.
The between-group difference in the ratio of participants who had reduction in the 51Cr-EDTA clearance was tested by the Chi-square ( χ2) test. Signifi- cance level was previously set at p < 0.05.Data are presented as mean and standard deviation.Results Flux of participants The flux of participants is shown in Figure 1.A total of 115 volunteers who were screened for participation and 69 volunteers did not meet the inclusion criteria.Theremaining 46 participants were randomly assigned to either the creatine (n = 23) or the placebo (n = 23) group.Afterwards, 15 participants withdrew for personal rea-sons (8 from the creatine group and 7 from the placebo group).Additionally, 5 participants (3 from the creatine group and 2 from the placebo group) did not attend thepost-intervention assessment; hence, they were removed from the analysis.Therefore, 12 participants in the creat- ine group and 14 participants in the placebo group wereanalyzed (n = 26).
Food intake Table 2 shows the food intake data. Protein intake ranged from 1.2 to 3.1 g/Kg/d.Diet remained unchanged throughout the study.Kidney function assessments Figure 2 shows the data regarding the51Cr-EDTA clear- ance.There were no significant differences between groups at Pre or Post (group × time interaction: F = 0.21, p = 0.64).In the creatine group, 2 out of 12 participants Figure 1 Fluxogram of participants.Lugaresi et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2013, 10:26 Page 3 of 6 http://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/26 had a decrease in the51Cr-EDTA clearance, whereas 6 out of 14 participants experienced reduction in the 51Cr-EDTA clearance in the placebo group (P( χ2>2 .0 8 1 )= 0.149).Table 3 presents the data regarding albuminuria, pro- teinuria, serum and urinary sodium and potassium, serum urea and serum creatinine.There were no signifi- cant differences between groups for any of the parameters(p > 0.05).
None of the participants had either albuminuria or proteinuria. Discussion The present results are in agreement with other investi- gations that have demonstrated the safety of creatinesupplementation on kidney function in distinct popula- tions [4-9].However, most of these studies estimated glomerular filtration rate by using serum endogenousmarkers, which are widely used in clinical practice but potentially susceptible to methodological errors.For in- stance, serum creatinine and its derivative equations areinfluenced by dietary intake, particularly by creatine- containing foods or supplements.Upon the ingestion of creatine, one may expect an increase in serum creatin-ine, since creatine is spontaneously and irreversibly converted into creatinine.As such, a false positive diagnosis of a decreased kidney function may occur increatine-supplemented individual when only serum cre- atinine data are taken into consideration.
Although serum creatinine was not significantly elevated in thecurrent study, previous observations from our group [8] and others [15] support the inaccuracy of creatinine- based markers in the evaluation of kidney function increatine-supplemented individuals.
To circumvent this potential bias, we measured glomerular filtration rate using the gold-standard technique 51Cr-EDTA clearance, which allowed us to properly conclude that creatine sup- plementation did not affect kidney function in this study.Table 2 Food intake before (Pre) and after 12 weeks (Post) of either creatine or placebo supplementation in resistance- trained individuals consuming a high-protein diet Creatine (n = 12) Placebo (n = 14) Variable Pre Post Pre Post P (group x time interaction) Protein (g) 154 (45) 154 (39) 133 (36) 120 (39) 0.54 Carbohydrate (g) 283 (70) 322 (96) 271 (92) 272 (124) 0.49 Lipid (g) 84 (23) 91 (27) 98 (31) 86 (31) 0.23 Protein (%) 25 (5) 23 (5) 22 (4) 22 (5) 0.65 Carbohydrate (%) 45 (6) 47 (9) 43 (10) 47 (6) 0.58 Lipid (%) 30 (6) 30 (8) 35 (8) 32 (6) 0.48 Total Energy (Kcal) 2506 (530) 2725 (522) 2518 (544) 2368 (781) 0.29 Protein/ body weight (g/Kg) 1.9 (0.5) 1.9 (0.5) 1.7 (0.5) 1.6 (0.5) 0.53 Data expressed as mean (standard deviation).
There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. No significant within- or between-g roup differences were noted.Figure 251Cr-EDTA clearance before (Pre) and after 12 weeks (Post) of either creatine (n = 12) or placebo (n = 14) supplementation in resistance-trained individuals consuming a high-protein diet.Panel A: individual data.Panel B: mean ± standard deviation.No significant difference between groups across time (group x time interaction) was observed (F = 0.21, p = 0.64).Note: Conversion factors for units: glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m2to mL/s/1.73 m2, ×0.01667.Lugaresi et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2013, 10:26 Page 4 of 6 http://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/26 Applying the above mentioned technique, we previ- ously showed that 35 days of creatine supplementation did not alter kidney function in a 20-year-old man with a single kidney [16].
Moreover, we reported that 3months of creatine supplementation had no deleterious effect on kidney function in post-menopausal women [9] and in type-2 diabetic patients [17], corroboratingthe safety of this supplement. The present data extend this notion to typical creatine consumers, suggesting that healthy resistance-trained individuals can “deal ” with creatine supplementation even in combination with a higher level of protein intake (considering the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) of 0.8 g/Kg/d).Inconsonance with our findings, a few cross-sectional studies have shown no significant differences in kidney function between higher and lower protein consumers[18,19].In fact, given the human habituation to the high-nitrogenous diet throughout the span of evolution, these findings might not be considered unexpected.Yet,further prospective studies must explore the impact of chronic nitrogenous-rich diets upon kidney function in healthy individuals.This study is not without limitations.
First, the follow- up of this study is too short, precluding any definitive conclusions. Originally, this trial was designed to cover a 12-month period.However, a drastic withdrawal rate forced us to reduce the follow-up period.Therefore, trialsof longer treatment duration are warranted.Second, we selected recreationally trained participants to increase the ecological validity of this study, since this population isthought to be the largest consumer of creatine supple- ments.However, it is possible that highly-trained athletes taking anabolic steroids and under exhaustive resistancetraining regimens may experience a differential response to creatine supplementation.Finally, it is worth noting that all of the individuals were apparently healthy, so thatthese data cannot be extrapolated to individuals with, or atrisk of, chronic kidney diseases.In such conditions, cre- atine users must be systematically monitored for kidney function.
Conclusions Three months of creatine supplementation did not have a detrimental effect on kidney function in resistance- trained practitioners consuming a high-protein diet (i.e., ≥1.2 g/Kg/d).
