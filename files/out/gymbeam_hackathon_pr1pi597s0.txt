Abnormal serum Magnesium Level is Associated with the Coagulopathy inTraumatic Brain Injury Patients Ruoran Wang, MD1#, Jianguo Xu, MD1, and Min He, MD2 Abstract Background: Coagulopathy is associated with poor prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.This study is performed to explore the association between serum magnesium level and the risk of coagulopathy in TBI.Methods: TBI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database were included for this study.Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore risk factors and develop a predictive model for coagulopathy in TBI.The restricted cubic spline (RCS) was utilized to analyze the association between serum magnesium level and the development of coagulopathy.Receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to evaluate the performance of the predictive model for coagulopathy.Results: The incidence of coagulopathy in TBI was 32.6%.
The RCS indicated the association between magnesium and coagul- opathy was U-shaped. Multivariate logistic regression con ﬁrmed age, coronary heart disease, cerebral vascular disease, chronic liver disease, GCS, ISS, epidural hematoma, hemoglobin, shock index and magnesium level were independently associated with the coagulopathy in TBI.Compared with patients of magnesium level between 1.7 and 2.3 mg/dL, those with magnesium level below 1.7 mg/dL or above 2.2 mg/dL had a higher risk of coagulopathy.Conclusion: Both hypermagnesemia and hypomagnesemia are associated with higher risk of coagulopathy in TBI patients.Physicians should pay more attention on preventing coagulopathy in TBI patients with hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia.Keywords magnesium, hypermagnesemia, hypomagnesemia, coagulopathy, traumatic brain injury Date received: 15 June 2024; revised: 2 August 2024; accepted: 21 August 2024.1.
Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health issue seriously inﬂuencing life quality of patients and causing huge economic burden to the society. It is reported that approximately 69 million people would suffer TBI around the world annually.1 Complications attributable to the head insult are not only limited to the brain but also involved in other extracranial systems including hematologic system, lung, heart, kidney,and gastrointestinal tract which is affected by the systemic inﬂammatory response.The coagulopathy is commonly observed in trauma patients with the incidence ranging from7% to 53%.2–4Moreover, TBI patients may have a higher inci- dence of coagulopathy than general trauma patients.Previous studies have reported that 7% to 49% of TBI patients woulddevelop coagulopathy and coagulopathy is a potent risk factor of poor prognosis in these patients.
5–7Therefore, identifying TBI patients at high risk of coagulopathy in early stage isbeneﬁcial for physicians to make suitable therapeutic options and maintain normal coagulative function. Some studies have conﬁrmed that hypoperfusion, low Glasgow Coma Scale 1Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China 2Department of Critical care medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China #Ruoran Wang is the ﬁrst author of this manuscript Corresponding Authors: Jianguo Xu, Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, P.R.China.Email: xujg@scu.edu.cn Min He, Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, P.R.China.

11,12While abnormalities of serum mag nesium level including hypo- magnesemia and hypermagnesemia would develop and be associated with hemorrhage pr ogression, bleeding events and outcomes in some diseases such as intracerebral hemor-rhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 13–16Until now, there are no study exploring the correlation between abnormal serum magnesium level and the coagulative disorder in TBIpatients.Therefore, we design this study to evaluate the asso- ciation between serum magnesium level and the risk of coa- gulopathy in TBI patients.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Patients Patients were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database designed and devel-oped by the computational physiology laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (Cambridge, MA).
This freely available database collects information ofpatients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) (Boston, MA) between 2001 and 2012 and obtains approvement from the institutional review boards of MIT andBIDMC. All patients included into the MIMIC-III were deiden- tiﬁed and anonymized regarding the privacy protection.We included patients with head trauma from the MIMIC-III basedon ICD-9 codes (80000 –80199; 80300 –80499; 8500 –85419).Then, patients were excluded according to the following crite- ria: (1) Age <18; (2) Lacked in records of GCS on admission;(3) Lacked in records of vital signs and laboratory test; (4) AIS < 3 (Figure 1).A total of 2280 patients were ﬁnally included after screening.2.2.Data Collection Age, gender, and comorbidities including diabetes, hyperten- sion, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, history of myocar- dial infarction, cerebral vascular disease, chronic liver disease,chronic renal disease, cancer were included as variables.
The shock index, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2), GCS, Injury Severity Score (ISS) on admission were collected. Intracranialinjury types con ﬁrmed based on radiological ﬁndings including epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemor- rhage were recorded.Results of laboratory test analyzed fromtheﬁrst blood sample during the ﬁrst day of hospitalizations were extracted including white blood cell, red blood cell, hemo- globin, blood glucose, serum calcium, serum magnesium.Themain outcome of this study was the coagulopathy con ﬁrmed based on the following criteria: Activated Partial Thrombin Time > 40 s or/and International Normalized Ratio > 1.2 or/and platelet < 120 ×10 9/L.10,17Incidence of neurosurgical oper- ation, 30-day mortality, length of ICU stay and length of hospi- tal stay were collected and compared between coagulopathygroup and non-coagulopathy group.All variables were extracted from the MIMIC-III database by Structure Query Language using Navicat Premium 12.
TheMIMIC-III database was designed and produced by the BIDMC. This database obtained approvements from the institu- tional review boards of MIT and BIDMC.All patients includedin this free public database were anonymized and de-identi ﬁed to protect individual privacy.This study was conducted com- plying with the ethical standards of the Helsinki declaration.2.3.Statistical Analysis Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to con ﬁrm the normality of collected variables.Normally distributed and non-normally dis- tributed variables were presented as mean ±standard deviation and median (interquartile range), respectively.And categorical variables were shown as number (percentage).Differences between two groups of normally distributed and non-normallydistributed variables were testi ﬁed by Student ’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively.Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was conducted to compare the difference betweentwo groups of categorical variables.
The restricted cubic spline (RCS) was performed to analyze potential non-linear relationship between magnesium level and the risk of coagulop-athy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were per- formed to discover risk factors for coagulopathy in TBI.Signi ﬁcant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression were incorporated to develop a predictive model for coagulopathy by the logistic regression.Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was drawn and area under the ROC curve(AUC) was calculated to evaluate the performance of the pre- dictive model.Two-sided P value <0.05 was considered being statistically signiﬁcant.SPSS 22.0 Windows software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL) and R software (version 3.6.1; R Foundation) were used for all statistical analyses and ﬁgures drawing.Figure 1.Flowchart of patients ’inclusion.2 Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis 3.Results 3.1.
Baseline Characteristics of Included TBI Grouped by Serum Magnesium Level 2280 TBI patients were included with the coagulopathy inci- dence of 32.6% (Table 1). The age of coagulopathy group was higher than non-coagulopathy group (p < 0.001).Regarding comorbidities, coagulopathy group had higher inci-dence of diabetes (p =0.013), coronary heart disease (p = 0.001), previous myocardial infarction (p =0.044), cerebral vascular disease (p =0.002), chronic liver disease (p < 0.001) and chronic renal disease (p < 0.001) than non-coagulopathy group.Compared with non-coagulopathy group, coagulopathy group had higher shock index (p < 0.001), ISS (p =0.011) and lower GCS (p < 0.001).It is noteworthy that the epidural hematoma was less frequently observed in coagulopathy group (p < 0.001).
Laboratory tests showed counts of whiteblood cell (p < 0.001), red blood cell (p < 0.001), level of hemoglobin (p < 0.001), calcium (p < 0.001) and magnesium(p < 0.001) were all higher in non-coagulopathy group while glucose level were higher in coagulopathy group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, coagulopathy group had higher mortality (p < 0.001), longer length of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and length of hos-pital stay (p < 0.001) than non-coagulopathy group.3.2.
Potential Risk Factors of Coagulopathy in TBI Analyzed by Univariate Logistic Regression Univariate logistic regression indicated age (p < 0.001), diabetes, coronary heart disease (p < 0.001), history of myocardial infarction (p =0.034), cerebral vascular disease (p=0.002), chronic liver disease (p < 0.001), chronic renal disease (p < 0.001), shock index (p < 0.001), SpO 2(p= 0.031), GCS (p < 0.001), ISS (p < 0.001), epidural hematoma(p < 0.001), red blood cell (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p < 0.001), glucose (p < 0.001), calcium (p =0.006) were all sig- niﬁcantly associated with the development of coagulopathy (Table 2).

3 3.3. Relation Between Serum Magnesium Level and the Risk of Coagulopathy in TBI Analyzed by the RCS, the unadjusted association between serum magnesium level and the risk of coagulopathy was shown as U-shaped curve in Figure 2A.After adjusting signi ﬁ- cant risk factors in the univariate logistic regression, the adjusted association between serum magnesium level and the risk of coagulopathy was still U-shaped in Figure 2B.Basedon the U-shaped curve, we divided the magnesium level into three groups including: < 1.7 mg/dL, 1.7 –2.2 mg/dL, > 2.2 mg/ dL.Then, we performed multivariate logistic regression toanalyze the relationship between three magnesium groups and coagulopathy in TBI and found both magnesium < 1.7 mg/dL (p=0.001) and magnesium > 2.2 mg/dL (p =0.038) imposed patients at higher risk of coagulopathy than magnesium 1.7 – 2.2 mg/dL (Table 3).3.4.
Multi-Factors Model for Predicting the Coagulopathy in TBI Signi ﬁcant factors in the multivariate logistic regression were incorporated to develop a model for predicting the coagulop- athy in TBI (Table 4). The multi-factors model was valuablein predicting coagulopathy with a AUC of 0.717.The sensitiv- ity and speci ﬁcity of this model was 0.673 and 0.649, respec- tively (Figure 3).4.Discussion The incidence of coagulopathy in our study was 32.6%, which was similar to previously reported incidence ranging from 7% to 49%.5–7And TBI patients with coagulopathy had higher mortality, longer length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay.7,18,19Previous studies have con ﬁrmed that coagulopathy could signi ﬁcantly increase the probability of poor outcome in TBI patients.Due to the high prevalence and harm effect of coagulopathy in TBI, identifying those with the high risk of coagulopathy in early stage after injury is vital for making suitable medical strategies bene ﬁcial for prognosis.
In our study, several factors were con ﬁrmed being independently related with the coagulopathy including age, coronary heart disease, cerebral vascular disease, chronic liver disease, GCS, ISS, epidural hematoma, hemoglobin, shock index, and abnor- mal magnesium level. According to the RCS curve presenting association between magnesium and risk of coagulopathy, wedeﬁned the abnormal magnesium level as <1.7 mg/dL and >2.2 mg/dL.Actually, the hypomagnesemia and hypermagne- semia is widely de ﬁned as <1.7 mg/dL and >2.2 mg/dL in the clinical practice, respectively.The incidence of magnesium <1.7 mg/dL and >2.2 mg/dL in our study was 30.6% (699/ 2280) and 6.0% (138/2280), respectively, which indicated that hypomagnesemia but not hypermagnesemia was prevalent in our included TBI patients.One prospective research investi- gating the incidence of electrolyte imbalance in TBI patients admitted to the ICU found the incidence of hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia was 66% and 14%, respectively.
20The different incidence of magnesium disorder between our study and this prospective research may be attributable to different injury severity, monitoring duration of magnesium and medical levels. There is no study exploring the association between magne- sium disorder and hemorrhagic or thrombotic events after TBI.The correlation between serum magnesium level and outcomesof stroke patients has been explored in several studies.One study found lower serum magnesium level on admission was independently correlated with the wider extent of initial hemor- rhage in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.
14 Another study con ﬁrmed higher admission magnesium level was independently associated with smaller initial hematoma volume and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients.13 Furthermore, three studies found lower serum magnesiumlevel was associated with a higher risk of hemorrhagic transfor- mation in ischemic stroke patients receiving mechanical throm- bectomy or thrombolysis. 21–23Actually, magnesium plays a pivotal role in the hemostasis process.Magnesium couldpromote coagulation by accelerating the platelet aggregation, the activation of factor X through the factor IXa and factor VIIa mediated pathways and decreasing intrinsic antithrom- botics including protein S and protein C.24–27Some trials have been performed to analyze the effect of magnesium sup- plementation on managing coagulative function and bleeding events.One trial found magnesium sulfate infusion signi ﬁcantlyTable 2.

29,30However, excessive ele- vation of magnesium may prolong prothrombin time and inhibitplatelet aggregation. 25,31,32One study revealed elevating serum magnesium from 0.85 to 1.50 mmol/L by infusing magnesium sulfate could inhibit platelet reactivity and prolong bleedingtime in healthy volunteers.33This ﬁnding was similar to our result that both abnormal low (<1.7 mg/dL) and high magne- sium (>2.2 mg/dL) level were signi ﬁcantly associated with the coagulopathy in TBI.Figure 2.A.Unadjusted association between serum magnesium level and coagulopathy in TBI.B.Adjusted association between serum magnesium level and coagulopathy in TBI.Adjusted factors include age, diabetes, coronary heart disease, history of myocardial infarction,cerebral vascular disease, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, SpO2, shock index, GCS, ISS, epidural hematoma, red blood cell, hemoglobin, glucose, calcium.Table 3.Multivariate Logistic Regression of Risk Factors for the Coagulopathy in TBI.

5 Two study experiments based on hemorrhagic shock rat model con ﬁrmed that resuscitation liquid containing magne- sium could recover coagulative function and correct coagulop- athy induced by massive hemorrhage.34,35As for TBI, many randomized controlled trials have been performed to explore the ef ﬁcacy of magnesium sulfate on improving prognosis based on its activity on NMDA-receptors, calcium channelsand neuron membrane. 36,37However, results of these trials were heterogeneous.And meta-analyses of these trials did not identify the bene ﬁcial effect of magnesium salt on the mortality of TBI.36,38The ef ﬁcacy of magnesium on TBI may be depen- dent on many factors such as therapeutic window, brain injury barrier integrity and patients ’severity.Whatever, the in ﬂuence of magnesium infusion on coagulopathy after TBI has not been explored.
Future studies are meaningful and worthwhile to explore the feasibility, safety and ef ﬁcacy of magnesium infu- sion on correcting coagulopathy and consequently improving prognosis in TBI patients with hypomagnesemia. Several limitations were not avoided in this study.Firstly, data of this study was collected from a single medical center.Selection bias may not be avoided.Secondly, medical history of anticoagulants and antiplatelets prior injury in ﬂuencing the coagulation could not be collected.The confounding effects of these factors could not be avoided.Thirdly, the intraparen- chymal hemorrhage progression is a severe bleeding eventand associated with both coagulopathy and outcome of TBI patients.While the MIMIC database did not record this event so that we could not evaluate the correlation between serummagnesium level and risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage pro- gression in TBI patients.
Finally, the association between initial magnesium level, magnesium infusion and the risk of coagulop-athy requires veri ﬁcation in future prospective multicenter studies and a randomized controlled trial even better.5. Conclusions Abnormal serum magnesium level (below 1.7 mg/dL orabove 2.2 mg/dL) is veri ﬁed associated with the higher risk of coagulopathy in TBI patients in this study.Our ﬁnding is worthwhile to be veri ﬁed in future studies.Physicians should pay more attention on managing coagulative system and bleeding events in TBI patients with hypomagnesemiaor hypermagnesemia.Author Contributions RRW contributed to the study design, statistical analyses, and manu- script writing.JGX revised the manuscript.MH performed data collec-tion and revised the manuscript.All authors read and approved the ﬁnal manuscript.Data Availability The datasets are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.
