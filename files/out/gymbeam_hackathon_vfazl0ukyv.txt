https://doi.org/10.1016/ j.isci.2024.110688 ll OPEN ACCESS iScience Article The inﬂuence of f1012gtwinning on the corrosion behavior of AZ31B magnesium alloy Xiangyu Li,1Baoji Ma,1,3,*Bin Liu,2Jinkui Cao,1Liangliang Li,1and Zhaopeng Xu1 SUMMARY This study investigates the effect of twinning on the corrosion behavior of AZ31B magnesium alloy using solid solution heat treatment (SHT) and laser shock peening (LSP) techniques. The corrosion characteristics are assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM), zero resistance ammeter (ZRA), scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET), and electrochemical tests.Results indicate that the twinning region in AZ31B magnesium alloy, enriched with f10 12gtensile twins induced by laser shock, demonstrates increased corrosion susceptibility.This region exhibits higher elec-trochemical activity and an accelerated corrosion rate compared to the matrix region.
Micro-galvaniccoupling between the twinned and matrix regions promotes faster dissolution of the alloy.Additionally, the corrosion product ﬁlm on the surface is extensively cracked and propagates to the matrixcorrosion surface, conﬁrming that f10 12gtensile twins provide inadequate protection against corrosion in AZ31B alloy. INTRODUCTION Magnesium alloys are regarded as promising materials in the medical sector due to their favorable biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties, notably their biodegradability, which may mitigate the need for secondary surgeries.1–7Although AZ31B magnesium alloy is biodegradable, its degradation rate surpasses the bone regeneration rate, potentially compromising the implant’s stability and durability in the body.8–12These disparities impose limitations on its clinical applications.Currently, enhancing the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys through deformation presents a viable approach for their use in medical implants.
Nonetheless, the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure of magnesium alloys features limited slip systems, resulting in poor formability and ductility. Additionally, signiﬁcant twinning occu rs during deformation, causing abrupt changes in crystal orientations within the parent grain when twins are activated.13–15This phenomenon, a type of lattice distortion, not only substantially affects the mechanical attributes of the metal but may also inﬂuence the corrosion resistance of the magnesium alloy matrix.16–18 According to the study by Gerashi et al.,19the effects of twinning and crystal structure on the corrosion behavior of magnesium alloys are explored in detail.This research elucidates how these factors inﬂuence the corrosion process, including the corrosion rate and the formationof corrosion products, and offers guidance for enhancing the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys.Xiong et al.
20introduced twins of varying densities into ZK60 magnesium alloy under different stress conditions. Electrochemical tests revealed that the corrosion rates of the alloys increased in the following order: ED-9% (high twin density) < original sample < ED-3% (low twin density).This variation correlateswith the degree of microstructural deformation; in the ED-3% samples, f10 12gtensile twins were only observed in larger grains,21resulting in orientation disparities between twinned and twin-free zones, which induced galvanic corrosion.22The optimal twin density to improve corro- sion resistance has also been conﬁrmed by Sabbaghian et al.18Mg-4Zn alloys subjected to extrusion deformation showed higher twin volume fractions in the TD and 45/C14samples.Characterization by EBSD of the 45/C14samples demonstrated that the basal faces had higher corrosion resistance compared to the pyramidal and prismatic faces, effectively reducing the corrosion rate.
Moreover, the 45/C14samples exhibited higher charge transfer resistance (R) and ﬁlm resistance (R), indicating superior resistance to corrosive media. Zou et al.17suggested that twin- ning in Mg-Y alloys might provide some protection, acting as micro-anodes where a ﬁlm preferentially forms on the twin boundary faces, thusstabilizing the alloy’s surface ﬁlm and enhancing its corrosion resistance in corrosive environments.This implies that the twin structure might play a role in mitigating corrosion.Although existing studies indicate that twinning may enhance the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys, other research suggests that the twin regions, due to micro-galvanic corrosion between the twins and the matrix, could become susceptible areas, accelerating the overall corrosion rate of these alloys.17,23These conﬂicting perspectives highlight the complex role of twins in inﬂuencing the corrosion behavior of magnesium alloys.
For instance, Zhou et al.24observed that intergranular corrosion was predominant in AZ31-H24 magnesium alloy in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution, proposing that twins may exacerbate this type of corrosion and decrease the alloy’s corrosion resistance. This suggests 1School of Mechatronic Engineering, Xi’an Technological University, No.2 Xuefuzhonglu Road, Xi’an 710021, China 2School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Tongchuan Vocation and Technical College, No.8 Chaoyang Road, Tongchuan 727000, China 3Lead contact *Correspondence: mabaojee@163.com https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.110688 iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024 ª2024 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ).1ll OPEN ACCESS that changes in twin structure could signiﬁcantly impact corrosion behavior.
Similarly, in studies by Schmutz et al.25on a large-grained mag- nesium sample with deﬁned defect structures, corrosion was noted to propagate at twin boundaries, indicating a critical interaction at these sites. Optimizing twin density is essential for achieving the best corrosion resistance.Moreover, research by Song et al.and Pawar et al.26,27 has underscored the importance of understanding the relationship between twinning and corrosion.Their ﬁndings suggest that the basal plane {0002} of magnesium alloys exhibits superior corrosion resistance compared to the prismatic plane f1010g.It appears that mild galvanic corrosion between twins and the matrix can accelerate the dissolution of the magnesium matrix, while also potentially facilitating the forma-tion of a protective surface ﬁlm.Thus, twinning may play various roles in the corrosion behavior of magnesium alloys.Although these effects have been documented, the precise mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear.
Gerashi et al. 19have elaborated on the roles of twinning and texture in the corrosion processes of magnesium alloys, yet these discussions often focus only on speciﬁc aspects of twinning.Based on the preceding summary, three key questions emerge: (1) what is the impact of twinning on the corrosion resistance of AZ31B magnesium alloy?(2) Do twins promote the formation of a surface ﬁlm?(3) If so, is the surface ﬁlm on AZ31B magnesium alloy protective?Addressing these questions is crucial for understanding the role of twinning in the corrosion processes of magnesium alloys and for enhancingtheir corrosion performance.In this study, as-cast AZ31B magnesium alloy plates are initially subjected to uniform heat treatment and lasershock peening to produce samples rich in f10 12gtwins.These samples are then tested in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid to evaluate the effect of twinning on the corrosion behavior of the AZ31B magnesium alloy matrix.
Materials and methods Preparation and treatment of materials The study utilizes as-cast AZ31B magnesium alloy samples to minimize the impact of original tissue texture on corrosion. The chemical composition of the samples conforms to the national standard GBT5153-2003, as detailed in Table 1 .Each sample measures 10 3103 5m m3and undergoes uniform heat treatment in a vacuum atmosphere tube furnace.The sample after heat treatment is labeled as T-1, whereas the sample subjected to both laser shock and uniform heat treatment is labeled as T-2.For T-1, the treatment temperature is set at 520/C14C for 4 h, followed by cooling to room temperature within the furnace.The treatment parameters for T-2 include a laser power of 4.95 GW/cm2, two impacts, a 50% spot overlap rate, and a subsequent annealing at 250/C14C for 1 h to alleviate the residual stress induced by the laser shock.
In this study, T-1 refers to the uniformly heat-treated sample without twins, and T-2 refers to the sample containing twins after laser shock. The residual stress in the T-2 sample, found to be insigniﬁcant upon detection, is not discussed further in this paper.Microstructure analysis The surface of the impact sample was progressively polished using metallographic sandpaper ranging from #1,000 to #5,000, followed by further mirror polishing with W1.0 diamond grinding paste.After polishing, the sample was ultrasonically cleaned in an ethanol (CH 3CH 2OH) solution.Metallographic etching was conducted using a solution composed of 10 mL nitric acid, 70 mL acetic acid, 10 mL distilled water, and4.2 g picric acid, with an etching duration of 5–15 s.Subsequently, the sample was immersed in simulated body ﬂuid at 37 G0.1 /C14C, the composition of which is detailed in Table 2 .
To evaluate the corrosion morphology, corrosion products on the sample surface were removed following immersion, and the sample was then soaked in a chromic acid solution (200 g/L CrO 3+ 10 g/L AgNO 3) for 5 min. The microstructure was characterized using a Nikon LV100ND metallographic optical microscope (OM), a Zeiss laser confocal microscope (Smartproof 5), a ZeissEVO scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a Zeiss electron backscatter diffraction microscope.Scanning Kelvin probe force microscope The Bruker Nano Inc.SKPFM is utilized to measure the Volta potential difference between the matrix and twins of the T-2 sample in the work-ing function mode.SKPFM is a technique designed for assessing surface potentials at the nanoscale.When the AFM probe contacts the sam-ple surface, charge transfer induces a potential on the surface.By quantifying the potential difference between the probe and the sample, thelocal potential distribution on the sample surface is determined.
Coupling test To compare the corrosion behavior of AZ31B magnesium alloy samples T-1 and T-2, two distinct techniques, ZRA Test and SVET Test, areemployed to assess the galvanic corrosion following coupling. Both tests are conducted in a 37 G0.1 /C14C simulated body ﬂuid solution.Table 1.Composition ratio of AZ31B magnesium alloy Element Al Zn Mn Si Ca Cu Ni Fe Mg Percent (wt.%) 3.2 1.4 0.7 0.07 0.04 0.01 0.001 0.003 Bal Table 2.Major components of the simulated body ﬂuids Component Na+K+Mg2+Ca2+Cl/C0HCO 3/C0HPO 42/C0SO42/C0 Percent (mM/L) 142.0 5.0 1.5 2.5 103.0 10.0 1.0 0.5ll OPEN ACCESS 2 iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024iScienc e Article The ZRA test utilizes the CHI600E electrochemical test system.For this test, T-1 and T-2 samples are each connected to a wire, encapsulated in epoxy resin to ensure ﬁxation and sealing, with an exposed detection area polished to 10 mm2.
The T-1 sample is connected to the ground of the electrochemical workstation, whereas the T-2 sample is attached to the electrode end. The workstation records the current every 5 s over a total duration of 2 h.The SVET test is performed using the VersaScan micro-area scanning electrochemical workstation.The T-1 and T-2 samples are coupled using conductive silver paste and connected via wires, followed by encapsulation in epoxy resin.The detection surface is polished to a mirror ﬁnish exposing an area of 200 mm2.The SVET tests are conducted over 1 and 2 h in a 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid environment.During the test, the probe tip is maintained at a distance of 100 mm from the sample, utilizing a Pt-Ir microelectrode with a tip diameter of 16 mm and an amplitude of 32 mm.Electrochemical experiment The PARSTAT electrochemical workstation is employed to perform electrochemical measurements in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid.
Mea- surements utilize a three-electrode sealed electrochemical cell, incorporating a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrodeand a platinum electrode as the auxiliary electrode. The electrochemical corrosion sample is connected to a copper wire, encapsulated inepoxy resin, and the detection area, polished to 100 mm 2, is exposed.The dynamic potential polarization curve test is conducted with a scan- ning speed of 1.0 mV/s.The anode and cathode scans are carried out separately to mitigate the effects of hydrogen evolution on the sample during corrosion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is performed over a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, with an excitationsignal consisting of a sine wave of 5 mV amplitude, and data analysis is facilitated using ZSimpWin software.To ensure the stability of the electrolyte and to eliminate initial interference, a delay of 10 min is introduced before conducting the experiments.
All electrochemical tests are replicated 2–3 times following the same procedure to conﬁrm the reliability of the results. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Microstructure characterization Figures 1 A and 1B display metallographic microscope images of the as-cast AZ31B magnesium alloy samples.The images illustrate that the sample T-2 ( Figure 1 B) contains a signiﬁcantly higher number of twin structures compared to sample T-1 ( Figure 1 A).The BSE SEM micro- graphs in Figures 1 C and 1D reveal that both samples T-1 and T-2 exhibit point-like and strip-like secondary phases, primarily composed of Mg, Al, and Mn elements.Given the minor proportion of these phases, this study does not focus on the micro-galvanic corrosion between Figure 1.Micrographs of the surface of the AZ31B magnesium alloy sample (A and B) are metallographic images of the surface of the T-1 and T-2 samples after etching; (C and D) are BSE-SEM micrographs of the surface of the T-1 and T-2 samples.
The most signiﬁcant difference between them in microstructure is the presence of twin structure in T-2 specimen.ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024 3iScienc e Article the secondary phases and the Mg matrix. The grain size of samples T-1 and T-2 is approximately 100 mm.The most notable distinction in their microstructures is the presence of twin structures in sample T-2.Prior to corrosion exposure, sample T-2 underwent EBSD testing, as depicted inFigure 2 .This analysis conﬁrmed the successful induction of a substantial number of {10 12} tensile twins on the pre-corrosion surface of sample T-2.Additionally, the inverse pole ﬁgure reveals a strong basal texture in the sample.SKPFM analysis To investigate the chemical activity differences between f1012gtensile twins and the matrix in AZ31B magnesium alloy, the T-2 sample was etched using metallographic techniques and then analyzed using SKPFM in air.
This process was aimed at obtaining the Volta potential dif- ference between f1012gtensile twins and the magnesium matrix to assess their relative activities. Figure 3 presents the SKPFM detection analysis results for the AZ31B magnesium alloy sample.SKPFM scanned the area within the square shown in Figure 3 A, with the morphological details of this area depicted in Figure 3 B.Figure 3 D illustrates the potential line scan analysis at the arrow indicated in the potential distribu- tion map in Figure 3 C.According to the Volta potential mapping, the magnesium matrix exhibits a higher potential relative to the twin plane within the twin area; the potential difference between them is approximately 30 mV.Areas with lower potential, such as f1012gtensile twins, are more prone to act as anodes.This ﬁnding indicates that the f1012gtensile twin area exhibits higher chemical activity than the magnesium matrix.
The minimal potential difference also suggests that micro-galvanic corrosion is likely to occur between f1012gtensile twins and the magnesium matrix. It is hypothesized that f1012gtensile twins may corrode preferentially in a corrosive solution.Corrosion morphology observation The AZ31B magnesium alloy samples T-1 and T-2 were polished before undergoing corrosion soaking in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid for 12 h, after which the corrosion products were removed.The resultant surface morphology, depicted in Figure 4 , reveals uneven corrosion characteristics, with both samples exhibiting smaller pitting pits alongside larger corrosion pits.Figure 4 B highlights the presence of twin structures within the larger corrosion pits of sample T-2, in stark contrast to sample T-1 shown in Figure 4 A.This disparity suggests that mi- cro-galvanic corrosion has occurred between the twins and the magnesium matrix.
Figure 5 presents SEM images of the cross-sections of samples T-1 and T-2 after 12 h of corrosion soaking. The depth of the corrosion pit in the twin-free T-1 sample measures 96 mm, whereas the pit in the twin-containing T-2 sample is deeper at 172 mm, with the twins clearly visible in Figure 5 B.This observation conﬁrms that regions with twins are more susceptible to corrosion compared to the Mg matrix, aligning with the SKPFM analysis results shown in Figure 3 .Furthermore, after soaking in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid for 2 h, the backscattered electron image of the corrosion surface for sample T-2 is shown in Figure 6 A.Grains with basal crystal orientation are labeled Grains A (A1–A3), whereas those with non-basal orientation are labeled Grains B (B1–B3).As depicted in Figure 6 B, Grains A (A1–A3) and Grains B (B1–B3) exhibit different corrosion depths.The average Figure 2.
EBSD analysis of the surface of AZ31B magnesium alloy sample T-2 (A), (B), and (C) are inverse pole ﬁgures; (D) and (E) are pole ﬁgures; (F) is the corresponding (0002) pole ﬁgure. It can be clearly observed that a large number of twins are successfully induced on the pre-etched surface of T-2 specimen, which are of type f1012gtensile twins.It is observed that the samples have strong base texture from the inverse polar diagram and the inverse polar diagram.ll OPEN ACCESS 4 iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024iScienc e Article corrosion depth of Grains A (A1–A3) is 20.33 mm, signiﬁcantly less than that of Grains B (B1–B3), which measures 52 mm, indicating that grains with non-basal orientations exhibit lower corrosion resistance.The laser confocal microscope analysis, shown in Figure 7 , further illustrates that adjacent grains experience varying corrosion depths.Figures 6 D and 6E demonstrate notable differences in the surface contours of the two grain types.
This variability suggests that the AZ31B magnesium alloy experiences differing corrosion depths during the corrosion process in simulated body ﬂuid, contingent on the crystal orientations of the grains.

The concentrations of P and Ca are slightly higher in the ﬁlm of sample T-1 than in T-2, suggesting that elements such as P and Ca precipitate from the simulated body ﬂuid onto the alloy surface, forming a Ca-P compound. The Ca-P compound ﬁlm is dense and resistant to degradation by Cl /C0ions.28Consequently, the cross-sectional morphology analysis suggests that the corrosion product ﬁlm of sample T-1 is thicker, inferring a relatively higher protective quality compared to sample T-2.After a 24-h soak in simulated body ﬂuid, the surface morphology of the corrosion product ﬁlms on the T-1 and T-2 samples is depicted in Figure 8 .Both samples exhibit relatively ﬂat corrosion product ﬁlms, with the surfaces of the corrosion pits covered by gray corrosion prod- ucts.These products consist of the ﬁlm itself and aggregated particles on its surface.Notably, the ﬁlms on both T-1 and T-2 samples displaycracks and segmentation into small pieces.
The chemical composition of the corrosion product ﬁlms was analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), with results for marked areas in Figures 8 A and 8G presented in Figures 8 C–8F and 8I–8L, respectively. A comparison of the EDS results between the T-1 and T-2 samples reveals that the phase of the corrosion products of the AZ31B magnesium alloy remainsunchanged, predominantly comprising Mg(OH) 2.The corrosion product ﬁlm on the T-1 sample is relatively smoother than that on the T-2 sample.As the soaking duration increases, the atomic percentage of elements C, O, and P in the EDS spectra rises, whereas that of Mg de- creases, suggesting the presence of Mg(OH) 2, Ca-Mg, and Mg 3(PO 4)2in the corrosion ﬁlm of the AZ31B magnesium alloy.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the corrosion product ﬁlms on T-1 and T-2 samples is presented in Figure 9 .Analysis of the XRD peaks reveals the crystal plane indices and corresponding peak values for the T-1 and T-2 samples.
For the T-1 sample, the peak values and indices for magnesium are as follows: 32.33/C14-(100), 34.55/C14-(002), 36.77/C14-(101), 48.01/C14-(102), and 57.59/C14-(110). The peaks for aluminum-mag- nesium alloy (Al 12Mg 17) are at 35.67/C14-(411), 40.14/C14-(332), 43.64/C14-(510), and 64.94/C14-(721).The peaks for magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2) occur at 38.14/C14-(101), 50.74/C14-(102), and 58.56/C14-(110) and those for calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) are located at 33.76/C14-(101), 47.14/C14-(102), 77.80/C14-(004), and 78.87/C14-(113).Sodium phosphate (Na 3PO4) shows peaks at 48.89/C14-(400), 61.13/C14-(422), and 64.94/C14-(511).For the T-2 sample, the magnesium peaks are at 32.16/C14-(100), 34.45/C14-(002), 36.72/C14-(101), 47.96/C14-(102), and 57.49/C14-(110).The Al 12Mg 17alloy shows peaks at 36.02/C14-(411), 40.08/C14- (332), 43.88/C14-(510), and 62.24/C14-(710).
Magnesium hydroxide peaks are at 32.94/C14-(100), 37.82/C14-(101), and 58.41/C14-(110), and calcium hydroxide at 33.66/C14-(101), 46.63/C14-(102), 78.95/C14-(113), and 84.58/C14-(211). Sodium phosphate is identiﬁed at 42.31/C14-(222) and 60.93/C14-(420).This analysis conﬁrms that elements in the simulated body ﬂuid interact with the alloy surface during corrosion, forming compounds that may inﬂuence the degradation rate of the AZ31B magnesium alloy.Further investigation into how these interactions affect the alloy’s degra- dation in simulated body ﬂuid is warranted.Coupling test To elucidate the corrosion behavior of alloys with and without twinning, T-1 and T-2 samples were coupled and subjected to soaking.The corrosion behavior of these samples was subsequently analyzed using a zero resistance ammeter test, as depicted in Figure 10 .
The results indicated that the current density curve consistently exhibited positive values, reaching a minimum of 0.48 mA cm/C02at 674 s, suggesting that the T-2 sample consistently acted as an anode undergoing dissolution. As shown in Figure 10 C, extensive corrosion was evident on the surface of the T-2 sample, whereas the T-1 sample exhibited relatively minor localized corrosion.This observation aligns with the earlier analysis ofcorrosion morphology, where the current density results for both T-1 and T-2 samples were found to be consistent, indicating a preferentialcorrosion of the T-2 sample when coupled, serving as micro-anodes.The coupling conﬁguration of the T-1 and T-2 samples is illustrated in Figure 11 , with the SVET results presented in Figure 12 .An anom- alous red area in Figure 12 , attributed to the conductive silver glue used during the coupling of the samples, is noted but not discussed further here.
The SVET results revealed that during soaking intervals of 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h, the surface voltage distribution of the T-1 sample was pre- dominantly negative, whereas that of the T-2 sample was predominantly positive. This trend in voltage distribution, consistent across different Figure 7.Cross-sectional morphology after soaking in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid for 24 h (A) T-1 sample.(B) T-2 sample.Analysis of the elemental distribution within the corrosion product ﬁlms reveals similar compositions for both samples, consisting predominantly of P, Ca, Mg, Al, O, Zn, CP, and Ca.
The concentrations of P and Ca are slightly higher in the ﬁlm of sample T-1 than in T-2, suggesting that elements such as P and Ca precipitate from the simulated body ﬂuid onto the alloy surface, forming a Ca-P compound.ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024 7iScienc e Article ll OPEN ACCESS 8 iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024iScienc e Article soaking times, shows that the surface current distribution of the T-1 sample was mainly negative (cathodic), whereas that of the T-2 sample was primarily positive (anodic). These ﬁndings corroborate the ZRA test results.Furthermore, macroscopic morphological analysis after soaking,as shown in Figure 12 C, indicates that the corrosion severity on the surface of the T-1 sample was milder compared to the T-2 sample, which exhibited more severe corrosion due to the presence of a large number of {10 12} tensile twins.
Electrochemical experiment The AZ31B magnesium alloy samples, T-1 and T-2, were immersed in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid to conduct dynamic potential tests over 0-h and 24-h durations. The dynamic potential polarization curves are presented in Figure 13 A.The Tafel curve ﬁtting results are summarized inTable 3 .These results indicate that as the twin density in the AZ31B magnesium alloy samples increases, the corrosion current density also increases, whereas the corrosion potentials remain closely matched.Initially, at 0 h, the corrosion potentials for T-1 and T-2 samples are /C01.43 V and /C01.47 V, respectively, with corresponding corrosion current densities of 1.20 310/C05A/cm2and 1.22 310/C05A/cm2.After 24 h, the corrosion current densities are 7.75 310/C06A/cm2for T-1 and 1.06 310/C05A/cm2for T-2, indicating that increased twin density leads to higher corrosion rates.
The T-1 sample exhibits a lower corrosion current, suggesting better corrosion resistance compared to the T-2 sam- ple, which contains a high number of {10 12} tensile twins and demonstrates faster corrosion and reduced resistance. To further analyze the electrochemical corrosion behavior before and after an increase in twin density within a simulated body ﬂuid envi- ronment, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests were conducted on samples after 0 h and 24 h of soaking.Figure 13 B displays the electrochemical impedance spectrum curves of AZ31B magnesium alloy samples T-1 and T-2 post-soaking.The ﬁtting results are detailed in Table 4 , where Rs represents the resistance in the electrolyte, Rp denotes the reaction resistance, and CPE1 characterizes a double-layer capacitor with the electrode surface in contact with the solution (constant phase element).
Nyquist diagrams show that the impedance spectra of both T-1 and T-2 samples are consistent both immediately after immersion and 24 h later, with high-frequency capacitance loops. The capacitive arc trend is the same across all tests, initially increasing, then decreasing, andultimately turning negative.A higher impedance modulus |Z| in the low-frequency region indicates a stronger protective ability of the corre- sponding corrosion ﬁlm.29As soaking time increases, corrosion intensiﬁes, predominantly manifesting as pitting corrosion, making it chal- lenging to form a stable protective ﬁlm on the sample surfaces.The impedance magnitude sequence for the four sample groups is T-1(24 h) > T-2 (24 h) > T-1 (0 h) > T-2 (0 h).After initial exposure to soaking, more defects emerge on the sample surfaces, making them proneto pitting.The presence of such defects facilitates Cl /C0aggregation, undermining the integrity of the surface ﬁlm and accelerating corrosion.
The differences in the impedance spectrum curves of T-1 and T-2 samples may stem from variations in corrosion rates, inﬂuencing the struc- ture of the MgO/Mg(OH) 2oxide layer formed on the sample surfaces.Figure 8.

This analysis conﬁrms that elements in the simulated body ﬂuid interact with the alloy surface during corrosion, forming compounds th at may inﬂuence the degradation rate of the AZ31B magnesium alloy.ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024 9iScienc e Article DISCUSSION Coupling test To further investigate the micro-galvanic corrosion behavior of AZ31B magnesium alloy samples T-1 and T-2, both ZRA and SVET tests were conducted. The comprehensive results indicate signiﬁcant micro-galvanic corrosion between the twin-zone T-2 sample and the matrix T-1 sample after coupling.Consistently, ZRA and SVET tests demonstrate that the T-2 sample, containing numerous {10 12} ten- sile twins, acts as an anode accelerating corrosion, whereas the T-1 sample serves as a cathode, thus afforded protection.The ZRA testrevealed a notable reduction in galvanic current between the T-1 and T-2 samples, with a critical turning point observed at 673 s.
This suggests that at this juncture, micro-galvanic corrosion between the twin zone crystal planes and the matrix predominantly contributes to the increased dissolution rate of the alloy. In conjunction with the observations from Figure 8 , the corrosion product ﬁlm formed after soaking the AZ31B magnesium alloy in 37 G0.1 /C14C simulated body ﬂuid exhibits some protective effects against corrosion rate reduc- tion.However, this protection is not predominant.Moreover, the SVET results displayed in Figure 12 indicate that the surface of the T-2 sample, containing {10 12} tensile twins, shows pronounced corrosion behavior after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of soaking in simulated body ﬂuid.This highlights the vulnerability of the T-2 sample to aggressive corrosion processes, particularly in regions with a high density of tensile twins.
Corrosion resistance test In the study of micro-galvanic corrosion of AZ31B magnesium alloy samples T-1 and T-2, measuring the galvanic current becomes challengingafter 2 h due to the growth of the corrosion product ﬁlm during the corrosion process. Electrochemical test results indicate that variations in twin density within the internal structure of T-1 and T-2 samples contribute to differences in electrochemical activity between the twin zonesand the matrix.Initially, at 0 h, the corrosion current density of the T-1 sample is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the T-2 sample, as shown in Figure 10.Zero resistance ammeter test (A) Galvanic current density in simulated body ﬂuid after coupling of T-1 and T-2 samples.(B and C) are the morphologies of samples T-1 and T-2, respectively.
The results indicatedthat the current density curve consistently exhibited positive values, reaching a minimum of 0.48 mA cm /C02at 674 s, suggesting that the T-2 sample consistently acted as an anode undergoing dissolution. Figure 11.Position diagram of the coupling relationship of T-1 and T-2 samples (A and B) are the actual test drawings, and (C) is the schematic diagram of the sample position relationship.ll OPEN ACCESS 10 iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024iScienc e Article Figure 13 A and Table 3 .The sequence of corrosion current density across the samples is T-2 (0 h) > T-1 (0 h) > T-2 (24 h) > T-1 (24 h).Corrosion current, a kinetic parameter, reﬂects the corrosion rate; higher values indicate faster corrosion rates and a greater propensity for the matrix tocorrode.Thus, the corrosion tendency of the AZ31B magnesium alloy samples is ranked as T-2 (0h) > T-1 (0h) > T-2 (24h) > T-1 (24 h).
The appearance of the capacitive arc in the high-frequency area of the Nyquist plots typically signiﬁes an electrochemical process related to changes in the electrode surface state within the electrochemical system. The interaction of charged ions in the simulated body ﬂuid withthe magnesium alloy leads to product deposition on the electrode surface, potentially forming compounds such as Ca-P.The corrosion prod- uct ﬁlm on the magnesium alloy, when soaked in simulated body ﬂuid, is likely formed through the following reactions 30: Mg/Mg2++2e (Equation 1) 2H2O+2e/C0/H2+2OH/C0(Equation 2) Mg+2OH/C0/MgðOHÞ2 (Equation 3) MgðOHÞ2+2Cl/C0/MgCl 2+2OH/C0(Equation 4) In simulated body ﬂuid, Mg undergoes hydrogen evolution galvanic corrosion, leading to the formation of Mg2+ions.Initially, Mg(OH) 2de- posits on the surface of the matrix, exhibiting loose and porous characteristics as depicted in Figure 14 A.
This allows Cl/C0ions from the simu- lated body ﬂuid to penetrate and dissolve these Mg(OH) 2deposits, resulting in the formation of soluble MgCl 2. This process contributes to Figure 12.SVET results of T-1 and T-2 samples after coupling in simulated body ﬂuid (A) Soaking for 0 h.(B) Soaking for 1 h.(C) Soaking for 2 h.(D) Macroscopic morphology after soaking for 2 h.The SVET results revealed that during soaking intervals of 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h, the surface voltage distri bution of the T-1 sample was predominantly negative, whereas that of the T-2 sample was predominantly positive.Figure 13.Electrochemical test results of T-1 and T-2 samples (A) Tafel curve.(B) Nyquist diagram.(C) Equivalent circuit diagram.The T-1 sample exhibits a lower corrosion current, suggesting better corrosion resistance compared to the T-2 sampl e, which contains a high number of f1012gtensile twins and demonstrates faster corrosion and reduced resistance.
The differences in the impedance spectrum curves of T-1 and T-2 samples may stem from variations in corrosion rates, inﬂuencing the structure of the MgO/Mg(OH) 2oxide layer formed on the sample surfaces.ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024 11iScienc e Article the continuous degradation of the Mg(OH) 2corrosion product ﬁlm, as illustrated in Figure 14 B. During the corrosion process, as described by the reaction in Equation 3 ,H2and OH/C0ions are produced.The OH/C0ions react with Ca2+and PO 43/C0in the simulated body ﬂuid to form Ca-P phase substances, represented by the reaction in Formula 6: Ca2++OH/C0+H2PO 4/C0+H2O/CaHPO 42H2O (Equation 5) This reaction explains why the bottom of the corrosion product ﬁlm contains signiﬁcant amounts of Mg(OH) 2, whereas the top is enriched with Ca-P phase substances, a ﬁnding also veriﬁed in Figure 7 .
The appearance of the impedance arc in electrochemical testing is generally associated with disturbances in the alloy surface state, such as ion enrichment or bubble interference, indicating challenges in forming a stableprotective ﬁlm on the sample surface as soaking time increases. 31The size of the double-layer capacitance impedance arc is indicative of the charge transfer process at the interface.Initially, the T-2 sample exhibits the smallest impedance arc diameter at corrosion onset (0 h), which gradually increases over time, reaching the largest diameter at 24 h.Typically, a larger impedance arc in the Nyquist spectrum suggests bettercorrosion resistance.The Nyquist spectrum reveals a relatively large impedance arc size for the T-1 sample, indicating superior corrosion resistance.As corrosion soaking time progresses, the emergence of a low-frequency impedance loop signiﬁes localized corrosion on the sample sur- face.
Over prolonged soaking, it becomes evident that the T-2 sample, which contains a signiﬁcant number of {10 12} tensile twins, is more reactive in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid compared to the T-1 sample. This enhanced reactivity leads to accelerated micro-galvanic corro- sion between the twin zone and the matrix, thereby increasing the corrosion rate of the AZ31B magnesium alloy.Conclusions In this study, uniform heat treatment and laser shock technology were employed to create two distinct microstructures within AZ31B mag-nesium alloy samples: the twin-free T-1 and T-2, which contains a signiﬁcant number of {10 12} tensile twins.Comparative analysis of these samples was conducted through SEM, SKPFM, ZRA testing, SVET testing, and comprehensive electrochemical assessments.The investiga-tion focused on the inﬂuence of {10 12} tensile twins on the corrosion behavior of AZ31B magnesium alloy in a simulated body ﬂuid environ- ment.
The key ﬁndings are summarized as follows: (1) SKPFM analysis revealed a notable Volta potential difference between the twin zone crystal planes and the matrix in the T-2 sample, with the twin zone exhibiting a more negative potential relative to the matrix. This indicates greater corrosion resistance in the matrix, aconclusion that is corroborated by the results displayed in Figure 4 .The observed low potential difference also suggests the occur- rence of micro-galvanic corrosion between the twins and the matrix.(2) Coupling tests on AZ31B magnesium alloy samples demonstrated consistent results between ZRA and SVET evaluations for both T-1 and T-2 samples.Upon coupling, the T-2 sample, enriched with {10 12} tensile twins, exhibited accelerated corrosion, acting as an anode, whereas the twin-free T-1 sample exhibited slower corrosion rates, acting as a cathode.
The ZRA tests showed that the galvanic current for both T-1 and T-2 samples increased post-inﬂection point and remained positive, suggesting that the corrosion product ﬁlm does not provide effective protection. (3) Corrosion resistance testing indicated that the corrosion current for the T-1 sample was lower than that for the T-2 sample, with an increasing Nyquist radius.This ﬁnding conﬁrms that the corrosion tendency of the AZ31B magnesium alloy samples when immersed in 37G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid follows the order T-2 (0 h) > T-1 (0 h) > T-2 (24 h) > T-1 (24 h).Table 3.Fitting results of Tafel curve of T-1 and T-2 samples Samples Icorr (A/cm2) Ecorr (V) T-1 0h 1.20 310/C05/C01.43 T-1 24h 7.75 310/C06/C01.31 T-2 0h 1.22 310/C05/C01.47 T-2 24h 1.06 310/C05/C01.37 Table 4.

Other types of magnesium alloys can also be used for reference and comparison.The degradation rate of AZ31B magnesium alloy in simulated body ﬂuid is affected by multiple effects, and the twin in grain is only one of the factors.Since {10 12} type twins have the highest content in AZ31B magnesium alloy matrix, only the response of {10 12} type twins to corrosion is considered in the discussion of this problem.Whether this conclusion is also applicable to other types of magnesium alloys remains to be studied.

The chemical composition of the samples conforms to the national standard GBT5153-2003, as detailed in Table 1 . Each sample measures 10 3103 5m m3and undergoes uniform heat treatment in a vacuum atmosphere tube furnace.The sample post heat treatment is labeled as T-1, whereas the sample subjected to both laser shock and uniform heat treatment is labeled as T-2.For T-1, the treatment temperature is set at 520/C14C for 4 hours, followed by cooling to room temperature within the furnace.The treatment parameters for T-2 include a laser power of 4.95 GW/cm2, two impacts, a 50 % spot overlap rate, and a subsequent annealing at 250/C14C for 1 hour to alleviate the residual stress induced by the laser shock.In this study, T-1 refers to the uniformly heat-treated sample without twins, and T-2 refers to the sample containing twins after laser shock.
Coupling test To compare the corrosion behavior of AZ31B magnesium alloy samples T-1 and T-2, two distinct techniques, ZRA Test and SVET Test, areemployed to assess the galvanic corrosion following coupling. Both tests are conducted in a 37 G0.1 /C14C simulated body ﬂuid solution.The ZRA test utilizes the CHI600E electrochemical test system.For this test, T-1 and T-2 samples are each connected to a wire, encapsulated in epoxy resin to ensure ﬁxation and sealing, with an exposed detection area polished to 10 mm2.The T-1 sample is connected to the ground of the electrochemical workstation, while the T-2 sample is attached to the electrode end.The workstation records the current every 5 secondsover a total duration of 2 hours.The SVET test is performed using the VersaScan micro-area scanning electrochemical workstation.The T-1 and T-2 samples are coupled using conductive silver paste and connected via wires, followed by encapsulation in epoxy resin.
The detection surface is polished to a mirrorﬁnish exposing an area of 200 mm 2. The SVET tests are conducted over 1 and 2 hours in a 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid environment.During the test, the probe tip is maintained at a distance of 100 mm from the sample, utilizing a Pt-Ir microelectrode with a tip diameter of 16 mm and an amplitude of 32 mm.Coupling tests on AZ31B magnesium alloy samples demonstrated consistent results between ZRA and SVET evaluations for both T-1 and T-2 samples.Upon coupling, the T-2 sample, enriched with {} tensile twins, exhibited accelerated corrosion, acting as an anode, while the twin-free T-1 sample exhibited slower corrosion rates, acting as a cathode.The ZRA tests showed that the galvanic current for both T-1and T-2 samples increased post-inﬂection point and remained positive, suggesting that the corrosion product ﬁlm does not provide effectiveprotection.
Electrochemical experiment The PARSTAT electrochemical workstation is employed to perform electrochemical measurements in 37 G0.1/C14C simulated body ﬂuid.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is performed over a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, with an excitation signal consisting of a sine wave of 5 mV amplitude, and data analysis is facilitated using ZsimpWin software. To ensure the stability of theelectrolyte and to eliminate initial interference, a delay of 10 minutes is introduced before conducting the experiments.All electrochemical tests are replicated 2-3 times following the same procedure to conﬁrm the reliability of the results.Corrosion resistance testing indicated that the corrosion current for the T-1 sample was lower than that for the T-2 sample, with an increasing Nyquist radius.This ﬁnding conﬁrms that the corrosion tendency of the AZ31B magnesium alloy samples when immersed in 37G0.1 /C14C simulated body ﬂuid follows the order: T-2 (0 h) > T-1 (0 h) > T-2 (24 h) > T-1 (24 h).ll OPEN ACCESS 16 iScience 27, 110688, September 20, 2024iScienc e Article
