The slaughter age signi ﬁcantly affected some AAs levels including glutamic acid, valine, isoleu- cine, histidine, and leucine, and some FAs level includingcapric acid, tetradecanoic acid , eicosanoic acid, total satu- rated fatty acids, 9-pentadecenoic acid, hexadecatetrae-noic acid, a-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, linoleic acid, dihomo- g-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, adrenic acid, omega 6, sum polyunsaturated fatty acids ( ƩPUFAs ), and unsaturation index. Subseq uently, the slaughter age signiﬁcantly affected some health indexes including the n- 6/n-3 ratio, thrombogenic i ndex, hypocholesterolemic/ hypercholesterolemic ratio, and health-promoting index.Valine, leucine, isoleucine, histidine, and glutamic acidlevels increased with increasing slaughter age until 35 d ofage and then decreased with inc reasing slaughter age until 49 d of age.
Moreover, the health indices of fatty acidswere best at slaughter age of 35 d, followed by 49 d, andthe lowest health-promoting indices were at 42 d, followedby 28 d. The sex did not affect ( P˃0.05) all the evaluat- ing parameters including chemical composition, amino acid and fatty acid pro ﬁles, and related health indices.There was no signi ﬁcant interaction effect between sex and slaughter age in all evaluating parameters except instearidonic acid level.In conclusion, amino acids and fattyacids pro ﬁles and health and nutritional values of male and female ROSS 308 broiler chicken breast muscle canbe affected by slaughter age.The study provides valuableinsights into the nutritional value of meat, including its composition, amino acid, and fatty acid pro ﬁles, and asso- ciated health indices, for both male and female fast-grow-ing ROSS 308 broiler chickens, as the slaughter ageincreases.

The poultryindustry plays a vital role in the supply of healthy meat products to the public.Broiler meat production from broiler is one of the major food-producing enterprisesglobally.Poultry meat quality is affected by many fac-tors, including the genotype, sex, age at slaughter ofbirds, and environmental conditions ( Castellini et al., 2008;Adamski et al., 2016 ).Owing to high metabolic activity in birds, the amount of glycogen stored inmuscles increases and results in high-quality meat (Aminzade et al., 2012 ).The nutritional quality of poul- try meat depends on the content of unsaturated fattyacids, high-value protein, micro- and macronutrients,and other biologically active components ( Soko »owicz et al., 2016 ).
Chicken meat is considered an easily avail- able source of high-quality protein and other nutrientsthat are necessary for proper body functioning ( Kralik et al., 2018 ). There are important determinants of meat quality such as the sex ( Bernardi et al., 2016 ) and the slaughter age of birds ( Díaz et al., 2010 ;Tougan et al., 2013).To meet the consumers ’growing demands for high-quality protein, the poultry industry focused on determining the appropriate slaughter age and optimum sex for broilers.Lukaszewicz and Kowalczyk (2014) stated that the chemical composition of the breast meatof broiler chickens depended on the sex and slaughterage.This has increased the number of supporters /C2112023 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received July 22, 2023.Accepted August 29, 2023.

Metabolomics is a widespread approach that offers qualitative and quantitative analysis of small moleculemetabolites in a biological system; small moleculemetabolites are the end products of cellular processesand can directly affect the phenotype ( Baira et al., 2018).Nutrient pro ﬁles such as fatty acids and amino acids were found to be important concepts in chicken meat consumption.These pro ﬁles are essential for devel- oping quality control and for monitoring the quality ofbroiler meat in the retail market and its impact onhuman health.
Poultry meat is a good source of PUFAs,especially omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 PUFAs ), including alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentae- noic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ), which pro- duce bene ﬁcial effects in the brain and cardiovascular system ( Laudadio and Tufarelli, 2011 ). Fatty acids are involved in technological aspects of meat quality.Chicken meat has an average of up to 20% protein, withover 40% of the total amino acids being essential ( Kim et al., 2017 ).The protein quality is mainly connected with the availability of amino acids present in it.Chicken meat offers all the essential amino acids and is characterized by a high content of leucine, aspartic, and glutamic acid ( Soriano-Santos, 2010 ;Nyam et al., 2023 ).The research on poultry meat has reported that theadvancement in age and sex are accompanied bychanges in meat quality ( Abou-Kassem et al., 2019 ).
Due to the importance of amino acids and fatty acids in optimal animal production and human nutrition, it isbeneﬁcial to the scienti ﬁc advancement to analyze the amino acid pro ﬁles of the meat species that are being studied. Hygienically, we need to provide suf ﬁcient information on the nutritional quality of poultry meat(i.e., chemical composition, amino acid pro ﬁle, fatty acid proﬁle), of broiler chicken meat, and choose the best one.Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigatewhether age and sex have an impact on the chemicalcomposition of meat, as well as the amino acid and fatty acid pro ﬁles and associated health indices of the muscle in fast-growing ROSS 308 broiler chickens.MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Scienti ﬁc Research, King Saud University ( KSU ), Saudi Arabia (Approval No: KSU-SE-21-02).
Design and Diets A total of 504, 1 d old, fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chicks (252 males and 252 females) were obtained fromthe Alkhomasia Company and randomly assigned to 72pens (36 pens for males and 36 pens for females). Eachpen housed either 7 females or 7 males (each cage was 28 cm£48 cm£48 cm) at the Poultry Research Center, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology(KACST ), Al-Muzahimiyah (24.471, 46.236), Saudi Arabia.Each pen had a 1-cm-thick mesh ﬂoor for waste collection and was equipped with a feeding trough out-side and 2 water bowls inside the pen.All groups werefed the same diet.Diets are classi ﬁed into 3 periods: starter (1 −11), grower (12 −22), and ﬁnisher (23 −slaughter age) based on protein and calorie require- ments for each age group, as shown in Supplementary Table S1 .As a result, diet was consistent in this trial, while sex and slaughter age were variables.The batteries were housed in a windowless room with forced ventila-tion.
Continuous light was provided during the experi-ment, and the temperature was gradually reduced from33°C to 23°C until the end of the study. The birdsreceived veterinary care, and vaccination programs wereimplemented following husbandry practices for broilerchickens.The weight of birds at different slaughter ages varies by country or culture.In this study, birds were dividedinto 4 groups according to age at slaughter (28, 35, 42,and 49 d) and sex (male and female) to obtain an 8-fac-torial arrangement.Measurements At each slaughter age, 16 fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chickens (8 male and 8 female) per group wereslaughtered to collect samples.Skins were removed frombreast muscle to determine proximate analysis, aminoacids, and fatty acids.Meat samples were homogenizedwith a grinder at 7,000 £gfor 10 s, then vacuum packed and stored in the freezer at -20°C until analysis.
Thesamples were then freeze-dried and ground again using a Panasonic grinder (MK-G20MR, Japan) to obtain a ﬁne powder. Determination of Chemical Composition by Proxi-mate Analysis Frozen dry samples of breast muscle from broiler chickens were ground into a homogeneousmixture in a mixer for chemical analyses.The proce-dures described by AOAC (1990) and Al-Abdullatif et al.(2023) were used to determine dry matter (%), crude protein (%), crude fat (%), and ash (%).Moisture content was determined using the weight of a 5-g meatsample before and after drying in a freeze-dryer (Modu-lyol-230, Milford, UK).Protein content was determinedusing the Kjeltec 2300 nitrogen/protein analyzer(Method 976.95), and fat content was determined usingthe Soxhlet extraction method (Method 920.39).Finally, ash content was determined by ashing the sam- ples in a muf ﬂe furnace at 500°C for 24 h (Method 942.05).Amino Acids Pro ﬁleThe content of amino acids in breast muscle was described by Saleh et al.(2020) .
Brieﬂy, 10 g of breast muscle and 40 mL of 0.1 N HCl were homogenized for 45 s and centrifuged at 15,000 £g for 50 min. The supernatant was ﬁltered and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-4 CM-PFE, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with a ﬂame ionization detector ( FID).The amino acids determined were aspartic acid ( ASP ),2 SULIMAN ET AL.threonine ( THR ), serine ( SER ), glutamic acid ( GLU ), glycine ( GLY ), alanine ( ALA ), valine ( VAL ), isoleu- cine (ILE), leucine ( LEU ), tryptophan ( TYR ), phenyl- alanine ( PHE ), histidine ( HIS), lysine ( LYS ), arginine (ARG ), proline ( PRO ), cysteine ( CYS ), methionine (MET ).Values were expressed in grams of amino acids per 100 g of breast muscle.Fatty Acid Deposition and Health and Nutritional Values of Breast Muscle Samples In preparation for the analysis of fatty acid composition, the freeze-driedmeat samples were ground.
Each sample was homoge-nized (3 £10 s at 3,000 rpm) with chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) to a volume of 45 mL. The superna-tant obtained was used to prepare fatty acid methylesters ( FAME ) with a mixture of methanol/sulfuric acid (95:5) and hexane according to the method pro- posed by Agnew et al.(2019) .The hexane extract obtained from the FAME was used for the quanti ﬁcation of free fatty acids using an Agilent 7890A GC/FID sys-tem (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equippedwith a DB-23 column (60 m £0.25 mm £0.25mm) to determine the FAME.The FAME peaks were deter-mined by comparing the retention times of the standardfatty acid mixture (Cat.No.24073, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) using Hewlett-Packard ChemStation soft- ware (Agilent Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE).Val-ues were expressed in g/100 g of each meat sample(quantitative evaluation) and % of total fatty acid(qualitative evaluation).
The average amount of eachfatty acid was used to calculate the sum of the saturatedfatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ), and polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs )(Dal Bosco et al., 2022 ). Health and Metabolic Indices Based on Fatty Acid Proﬁles Analysis Health indexes such as the n-6/n-3 ratio, atherogenic index ( AI), thrombogenic index ( TI), nutrition value index, hypocholesterolemic to hypercholes-terolemic ratio ( H:H ratio ), health-promoting index, and metabolic indexes such as elongase, thioesterase, andkinetic activity index of n-3b-oxidation in the muscles are calculated as described in Dal Bosco et al.(2022) .
Statistical Analysis Data were statistically analyzed based on a 2 £4 fac- torial arrangement using the following model: Yijk¼mþAiþSjþASijþeijk ;where Y ijkis an observation, mis the overall mean, S j is the effect of sex (I = 1 −2), Ai is the effect of age at (j = 1−4), AS ijis the interaction between 2 variables, and e ijkthe experimental random error. To detect differ- ences between treatments, Tukey ’s test was performed post hoc.All differences were considered signi ﬁcant at P<0.05.RESULTS Chemical Composition of Meat The effects of sex and slaughter age of broilers on the chemical composition of meat are shown in Table 1 .Age at slaughter and sex had no effect ( P>0.05) on the chemical composition of the breast muscle of fast-grow-ing Ross 308 broilers.There were no signi ﬁcant differen- ces between sexes in the parameters studied (Dry matter“DM,”ash, crude protein “CP, ”and fat).Females were found to have a lower CP % (72.52 vs.73.32%, P>0.05) and a higher fat % (26.34 vs.
25.42%, P>0.05) than males. These parameters were also not affected by slaughter age.In general, higher CP % (74.84 and75.69%, P>0.05) and lower fat % (23.91 and 23.01%, P>0.05) were found in younger birds (aged 28 and 35 d, respectively) than in older birds (aged 49 d)(CP = 68.59% and fat = 30.21%).The interactionbetween slaughter age and sex was not signi ﬁcant for the chemical composition of the breast muscle.Amino Acids Pro ﬁle As shown in Tables 2 and3, no signi ﬁcant differences (P>0.05) in pectoral muscle amino acid pro ﬁles were detected between sexes or interaction between sex andage in fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chickens.The high-est amino acids were GLU then ASP, LYS, and LEU,and then ALA and ARG, but the lowest amino acid wasCYS.Age at slaughter showed signi ﬁcant differences in some amino acids, namely GLU, VAL, ILE, LEU, and HIS, but it had no signi ﬁcant effect on the remaining amino acids (ASP, THR, SER, GLY, ALA, TYR, PHE,LYS, ARG, PRO, CYS, and MET).
Age had a signi ﬁ- cant effect on the content of amino acids in the pectoralmuscle. GLU, VAL, and HIS values were signi ﬁcantly higher ( P<0.05) in the younger group (at 28 and 35 d) than in the older group (at 49 d).The ILE and LEU val- ues were signi ﬁcantly higher ( P<0.05) in the younger group (at 35 d) than in the older group (at 49 d).TheTable 1.Effects of sex and slaughter age and their interactions on the chemical composition of breast muscle of fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chickens (on a dry basis).

Fatty Acid Pro ﬁle The results presented in Tables 4 to8show the effects of slaughter age, sex, and their interaction on the fatty acid pro ﬁle of broiler chicks.Age at slaughter, sex, and their interaction had no effect ( P>0.05) on the satu- rated fatty acids of the breast muscle of fast-growingRoss 308 broiler chickens ( Table 4 ).
However, slaughter age had a signi ﬁcant effect ( P<0.05) on capric acid, lau- ric acid, and then total saturated fatty acids. These parameter values were signi ﬁcantly highest in the youn- ger age group (at 28 d of age) and lowest in the older agegroup (at 49 d of age), but were intermediate in the mid-dle age groups (at 35 and 42 d of age).Age at slaughter, sex, and their interaction had no effect ( P>0.05) on MUFAs in the breast muscle of fast- growing Ross 308 broiler chickens ( Table 5 ).However,Table 2.Effects of sex and slaughter age and their interactions on amino acids pro ﬁle of breast muscle of fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chickens.

The 6,9,12,15-hexadecatetraenoic acid ( C16:4 n-3)a n d stearidonic acid were highest in the breast muscle ofbirds reared to 35 d of age (especially in female birdsconcerning C18:4 n-3 because of the interaction effect of sex and age at slaughter on C18:4 n-3). While a-linolenic acid ( C18:3 n-3) was better in the group of birds raised to 49 d.Age at slaughter, sex, and the interaction between age at slaughter and sex had no effect ( P>0.05) on omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids of the breast muscle of fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chickens ( Table 7 ).However, slaughter age signi ﬁcantly ( P<0.05) affected linoleic acid ( C18:2 n-6), C20:3 n-6, arachidonic acid ( C20:4 n- 6), and adrenic acid ( C22:4 n-6), resulting in signi ﬁcantdifferences in total omega-6 PUFAs ( ƩPUFAs n-6).The highest levels of these 3 individual PUFAs n-6 and ƩPUFAs n-6 were observed in older birds (up to 49 d).
The highest levels of ƩPUFAs n-6 were observed in birds raised at 49 and then at 35, whereas the lowest lev-els were observed in birds raised at 28 and 42. Therefore,the highest unsaturation index was observed in birdsreared at 49 and then at 35, while it was lowest in birds reared at 28 and 42 ( Table 8 ).In addition, no signi ﬁcant differences ( P>0.05) in other PUFAs (C16:3 n-4, C18:3 n-4, and C18:2 n-4, C18:2 n-5, and C18:2 n-7) were observed between slaughter age, sex, and their interac-tion in Table 8 .In general, although total fatty acids and MUFAs were not affected by slaughter age, both total saturatedand total polyunsaturated fatty acids were affected by slaughter age.At older age (49 d of slaughter age), the percentage of saturated fatty acids was lowest and thepercentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids was highest.

The n-6/ n-3 ratio, TI, H:H ratio, and health index of fast-growing Ross 308 broiler chickens were not affected by sex or theinteraction of slaughter age and sex ( P>0.05).
These health indices were signi ﬁcantly affected by slaughter age, with the health-promoting index in the group raised to 35 d and then to 49 d having the lowest thrombogenic index and the highest H:H ratio. The groups with rear-ing ages of 28 d and 42 d had the worst health-promotingindex, as they had the highest thrombogenic index andthe lowest H:H ratio.In addition, the group with rearingages of 42 d had the highest n-6/n-3 ratio compared to other groups.Birds in all groups had similar metabolicindexes: elongase, thioesterase, and activity index werenot in ﬂuenced ( P>0.05) by age at slaughter, sex, or their interaction.DISCUSSION The chemical composition of poultry products is an important constituent in terms of consumption andfrom a well-being perspective of humans ( Attia et al., 2016).The chemical composition of chicken meat is theTable 7.

(2014) stated that contents of moisture and fat were affected by the slaughtering age. In general, increasingthe age the level of moisture in the meat was decreased and that fat was increased.The moisture content of meat declines as the age of the bird increases, which isprobably linked to an increase in protein and fat content(Lawrie and Ledward, 2014 ).Ilavarasan et al.(2016) showed that the meat of older birds had lower moistureand higher fat, protein, and total ash content than youn-ger birds.Díaz et al.(2010) showed that the protein con- tent of meat of chicken breeds was decreased and fat was increased when bird age was increased.The protein and lipid content of raw breast muscle increased signi ﬁcantly with age ( Ba/C19eza et al., 2012 ).They recommend slaugh- tering chickens of the heavy line at 42 d of age.Teixeira Zanusso (2002) reported that lipid levels increased regu- larly in the breast and thigh muscles of chickens from 6-to 22-wk old.
However, our ﬁndings were different from the reports of Baira et al. (2018) who found that the pro- tein concentration increased with age.Díaz et al.(2010) illustrated that the meat of the youngest birds exhibitedhigher ash content than that of the older ones.Abdullah et al.(2010) found that there were no signi ﬁcant differ- ences in the body composition of the broiler birds whichcould be related to the bird gender at 28 d of age, butthe sex had a signi ﬁcant difference in body composition at 49 d of age.Marx et al.(2016) clariﬁed that female carcasses contain a higher percentage of fat than that of males.Also, moisture and fat contents were statisticallydifferent between males and females, but other parame-ters, such as protein and ash, were not affected by sex.Choi et al.(2012) described that the estrogen secreted by the ovary could increase lipid deposition among myo-ﬁbers.Similarly, Genchev et al.
(2008) detected higher lipid content in female carcasses with skin than those of male ones, while meat dry matter, protein, and ash con- tents were not signi ﬁcantly different between the 2 gen- ders. Further, Sartowska et al.(2014) reported no differences in the breast meat content of protein and ashbetween males and female.In contrast, Magubane et al.(2013) detected similar fat content in the breast muscles of males and females.The dietary value of meat is mostly de ﬁned by the composition and ratio among the different groups of nutrients.One criterion for meat evaluation is its essen-tial amino acids ( Genchev et al., 2008 ).Amino acids arethe building blocks of protein but also play important cellular signaling roles ( Canﬁeld and Bradshaw, 2019 ).The amino acid pro ﬁle of the protein contributes to the quality of the meat.
There are great efforts to determinethe appropriate age and the better sex in the meat con-tent of amino acid pro ﬁle in broiler chickens ( Waheed et al., 2018 ). Also, Watanabe et al.(2004) stated that the levels of amino acids in meat were in ﬂuenced by the slaughter age.Amino acids are generally seen as the main precursors of ﬂavor substances.In particular, GLU was shown to have a considerable effect on the taste ofchicken meat.In addition to GLU, free aromatic aminoacids, such as PHE and TYR, also play an importantrole in enhancing the savory or umami taste at sub-threshold concentrations in the presence of salt and freeacidic amino acids ( Wattanachant et al., 2004 ;Huang et al., 2011 ).Other amino acids, such as CYS, GLY, ASP, ARG, and ALA, are also considered to be ﬂavor- related amino acids ( Liu et al., 2016 ).There are great efforts to determine the appropriate age and the better sex in the meat content of fatty acidproﬁle in broiler chickens ( Waheed et al., 2018 ).
The quality and composition of meat are in ﬂuenced by numerous factors, namely, the gender of birds andslaughtering age ( Genchev et al., 2008 ).Poureslami et al. (2010) stated that the effect of sex was signi ﬁcant for C16:0, C18:0, C18:1n-9, and C20:1n-9, with a higherfatty acid content in the female birds than in the malebirds.Also, they reported that the age signi ﬁcantly affected SFAs and MUFAs appearance/disappearance,with higher values at 7 to 21 d for all the given fattyacids, except for C18:0 and C18:1n-9.The effect of sexwas only signi ﬁcant on C18:0 appearance, with higher values in female birds.The fatty acids, especially PUFAs, have an important role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovasculardiseases, and in normal growth and development ( Simo- poulos, 2004 ;Alagawany et al., 2019 ;Bae et al., 2023 ).Public awareness of healthy meat foods rich in n-3 PUFAs in the human diet is increasing ( Bernardi et al., 2016).
Chicken meat can be enriched with n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid ( C20:5n3, EPA ), and DHA (Kralik et al., 2018 ). There has been interest in the role of poultry meat as a dietary source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, including alpha-linolenic acid, EPA, and DHA(Dalziel et al., 2015 ).The higher linoleic and arachidonic acid contents of breast muscle can be an attractive nutri-tional quality trait for health-conscious consumers(Trembecka et al., 2016 ).Polyunsaturated fatty acids, like linoleic acid and linolenic acid, reduced cholesterol content ( Coughlan et al., 2022 ;Siddique, 2023 ).The increase in the n-3 PUFAs in broiler muscles may induce a correspondingreduction in the n-6 fatty acid (linoleic and arachidonic)in breast and thigh muscles because these 2 groups ofthe fatty acid contest for the same desaturation enzymes(Nuernberg et al., 2005 ).In this study, the TI shows a higher tendency to form blood clots in the vessels in males than in females.
AIand TI values were lower in females than in males andEFFECT OF SLAUGHTER AGE ON BROILER MEAT COMPOSITION 7 lower on d 35 and 49 than on d 28 and 42, consistent with Abou-Kassem et al. (2019) , who indicated that smaller AI and TI values suggest a protective potentialfor coronary artery health and potential for stimulationof platelet aggregation due to the ratio of prothrombo-genic (saturated) to elevated antithrombogenic fattyacids (MUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, and n-3 PUFAs) ( Ghaeni et al., 2013 ).The human diet in Western countries is imbalanced in terms of the ratio of n-6 to n-3 because the Western diet is de ﬁcient in n-3 fatty acids, unlike the diet of our ancestors.Therefore, foods with lower n-6/n- 3 ratios (here, all ratios are desirable except 42 d) aremore desirable to reduce the risk of many chronic dis-eases that are prevalent in Western societies ( Simopou- los, 2000 ,2008).
Regardless, the values obtained for the meat of the 2 poultry sexes can be considered highlynutritious, with the male breast having the best values. The ratio between hypocholesterolemic and hyper- cholesterolemic fatty acids indicates the different effectson cholesterol metabolism: higher values are consideredmore bene ﬁcial for human health.In this study, we obtained higher values in male chickens than in femalechickens and higher values on d 35 and 49 than on d 28and 42.The health-promoting index represented theinverse of AI, as previously reported, and thus had inverse values compared with AI (2.10 vs.2.14 in males and females) and (2.35 vs.1.96 respectively, in 35 and42 d).Meat fatty acid pro ﬁles showed a signi ﬁcant effect on the meat quality that can be attributed to the sex andslaughter age.The fatty acid pro ﬁle of muscle tissue can alter the blood levels of lipoproteins and triglycerides(Abdulla et al., 2015 ), improving the product quality (e.g., omega 3 and omega 6).
This improvement is concor- dant with the consumers ’interest. Chemical compositions were numerically better (greater percentages of DM, ash, crude protein, andlower percentages of fat) as well as amino acid contentsin 35-day-old birds than in 49-day-old birds.In bothslaughtering bird groups, health-related variables werecomparable.As a result, slaughtering at 35- or even 49- days old is recommended.However, the majority of con- sumers prefer broiler chickens on d 35 rather than d 49.Furthermore, from an economic standpoint, theextended raising period results in a larger economic loadwith less bene ﬁt due to increased feed consumption and other maintenance costs.CONCLUSIONS This study aimed to examine the potential impact of age and sex on the chemical composition of meat, as wellas the amino acid and fatty acid pro ﬁles and related health indices of the muscle in fast-growing ROSS 308broiler chickens.
This study ’sﬁndings indicate that sex did not impact the chemical composition, amino acid,and fatty acid pro ﬁles of meat. Furthermore, amino acids and fatty acids pro ﬁles and health and nutritional values of male and female ROSS 308 broiler chickenbreast muscle can be affected by slaughter age.Although metabolic indices were similar across different slaughter ages, health indices were signi ﬁcantly impacted by age.These results provide valuable information for meatprocessing and may also bene ﬁt consumers who prefer chicken meat.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputy- ship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Educationin Saudi Arabia for funding this research through the project No.IFKSURO3-542-1.Funding: This research was funded by the Deputyship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Education inSaudi Arabia through project No.IFKSURO3-542-1 .
