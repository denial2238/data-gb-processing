The clinical outcome of oral iron supplementation for ID anaemia in patients with HF was the primaryendpoint. The primary safety measures included adverse events and all-cause mortality, and ef ﬁcacy measures included trans- ferrin saturation (Tsat), ferritin levels, and the 6-min walk test (6MWT).The rate ratio (RR) was used to pool the ef ﬁcacy measures.Results Five randomized controlled trials that compared oral iron treatment for patients with the placebo group and included a combined total of 590 participants were analysed.No signi ﬁcant difference was found in all-cause death between oral iron treatment and placebo groups (RR ¼0.77; 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI), 0.46 –1.29, Z ¼0.98; P ¼0.33).However, adverse events were not signi ﬁcantly higher in the iron treatment group (RR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60 –1.16, Z ¼1.07; P ¼ 0.28).
In addition, ferritin levels and Tsat were slightly increased after iron complex administration in patients with HF but were not statistically signi ﬁcant (ferritin: mean difference [MD] ¼2.70, 95% CI, –2.41 to 7.81, Z ¼1.04; P ¼0.30; Tsat: MD ¼27.42, 95% CI, –4.93 to 59.78, Z ¼1.66; P ¼0.10). No signi ﬁcant difference was found in exercise capacity, as indicated by the 6MWT results (MD ¼59.60, 95% CI, –17.89 to 137.08, Z ¼1.51; P ¼0.13).We also analysed two non-randomized con- trolled trials with follow-up results showing that oral iron supplementation increased serum iron levels (MD ¼28.87, 95% CI, 1.62 –56.12, Z ¼2.08; P ¼0.04).Conclusions Based on the current ﬁndings, oral iron supplementation can increase serum iron levels in patients with HF and ID or mild anaemia but does not improve Tsat and 6MWT.In addition, oral iron supplementation is relatively safe.

Introduction Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disabling syndrome associated with a lower quality of life and shorter longevity, which could be described as a ‘malignant condition ’owing to its poor prognosis1,2and a 10% prevalence in people aged ≥65 years,3,4 resulting in high mortality and a huge social burden.5Approx-imately 30 –50% of stable patients with HF have iron de ﬁciency (ID) or anaemia during the remainder of life,6which is an inde- pendent risk factor for patients with HF. ID can further reducefunctional capacity, impair the quality of life, and ultimately in- crease the re-hospitalization rate and economic costs.7–9 Therefore, the impact of iron treatment on patients with HF and ID or anaemia would be of clinical interest.REVIEW © 2022 The Authors.ESC Heart Failure published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Society of Cardiology.

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have shown that intravenous iron admin-istration contributes to increased iron bioavailability and ex- ercise capacity, as well as decreased re-hospitalization.10–13 However, intravenous iron is relatively expensive and incon- venient to administer at scale for non-hospitalized patients, particularly in many countries with limited healthcare resources.14–16Furthermore, the safety of intravenous iron is unclear.
In contrast, oral iron supplementation is easily available and more economic. Thus, clinicians often recom- mend oral iron.The disadvantages of intravenous iron placeoral iron as a good alternative therapeutic approach.Never- theless, absorption problems with oral administration have impeded its widespread use.The safety of oral iron remains to be established, as gastrointestinal side effects have been reported.Meanwhile, several clinical studies have inconsistent results about oraladministration.
14,17 –19Partial clinical studies demonstrate that oral iron therapy can elevate haematological parameters and improve functional capacity,14,19,20whereas recent stud- ies report that it is ineffective in improving cardiac function.21 Two multicentre, double-blinded RCTs, IRON-HF andIRONOUT, have demonstrated that oral iron supplementationfailed to raise the peak volume of oxygen consumption (VO 2)and the distance in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) compared with placebo, which suggests against oral iron supplementa- tion in patients with HF with ID or mild anaemia.16,17Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to establish the safety and efﬁcacy of oral iron supplementation in the chronic HF popu- lation with ID or mild anaemia safe and effective. Methods Data sources and search strategy A literature search was conducted on the Cochrane Library,PubMed, and Embase databases.The Medical Subject Head- ings keywords and free words used for the search were ‘anaemia ’and ‘heart failure ’.
Two researchers independently performed the search. When disparities occurred, consensus was reached through discussion and consultation.A ﬂow chart of the literature search is shown in Figure 1.Inclusion and exclusion criteria Using the PICO model,22the potential clinical trials that met the following criteria were considered for inclusion in the Figure 1 The clinical studies ’selection process was presented in ﬂow chart.2780 M.Tang et al .ESC Heart Failure 2022; 9: 2779 –2786 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.14020 meta-analysis: (i) all symptomatic stages of HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes II –IV, with ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%] with ID or anaemia ( ≥18 years old), (ii) oral iron administration to patients with HF, (iii) oral placebo or blank for control group, and (iv) evaluation of ef ﬁcacy and safety of oral iron supplementation.
The exclusion criteriawere as follows: (i) studies on other diseases like chronic kid- ney disease, (ii) intravenous iron intervention or erythropoie- tin (EPO) combination treatment, and (iii) other researchtypes, for example, retrospective study, review, systematic re- view, and meta-analysis. Data extraction The following data were independently extracted by two car-diologists: (i) population characteristics, including the number of participants, age, and sex; (ii) drug types, dosage, treat-ment duration, and the duration of follow-up; and (iii) the evaluation of results.When discrepancies occurred between the two cardiologists and could not be resolved, statistics ex-perts were consulted or the original authors were sought for intervention by e-mail.In the process, a third reviewer super- vised the work and censored the data to minimize mistakesand missing crucial information as much as possible.
Quality assessment The risk of bias in this meta-analysis was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool.23Based on the standards speci ﬁed in the manual, we graded each part as low risk for bias, unclear risk if lacking information or uncertain over the potential for bias, and high risk for bias. Furthermore, we assessed trials for methodological quality and examinedbias for the following: selection bias, random sequence gen- eration and allocation concealment; performance bias, blinding of participants and researchers; detection bias,blinding of outcome assessment; and attrition bias, incom- plete outcome data, and other biases.24 Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed using Review Manager Version5.3 software.The continuous variables, namely, ferritin level, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and 6MWT distance, wereanalysed by calculating the mean difference (MD) with stan- dard deviation (SD) of the mean.
When the sample mean and SD could not be directly obtained, other statisticalmethods were applied to estimate the approximate effect sizes. 25Dichotomous data were analysed using the rate ratio (RR), and each result was expressed with 95% con ﬁdence interval.Statistical heterogeneity was quanti ﬁed via the I2 statistic.An I2>50% or P<0.1 indicated signi ﬁcant hetero-geneity.We used the random-effects model; otherwise, the ﬁxed-effects model was applied.Sensitivity analysis was per- formed to estimate the statistical effect value with the addi-tion of two studies.P<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.Results Article selection process The article selection process is presented in Figure 1.A total of 1803 records were retrieved by electronic database search.After removing duplicates, 1417 records were included.After skimming the titles and abstracts, we removed 1364 studies that were irrelevant to our research topic.
Subsequently, 59potentially eligible studies were identi ﬁed and recaptured for full-text scanning, but 54 articles did not match the inclu- sion criteria. Ultimately, ﬁve RCTs on oral iron administration to patients with HF with ID or mild anaemia were included in the meta-analysis.16,17,20,21,26 Patient baseline characteristics The baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.A to- tal of 590 participants were included, with the age ranging from 18 to 75 years and the duration of follow-up rangingfrom 8 to 26 weeks.All patients underwent standard HF ther- apy, with the treatment group placed under oral iron therapy, whereas the control group was given placebo or blank.Ferrous sulfate and polysaccharide iron complex were admin- istered with the dose varying from 150 to 350 mg.All patients had established chronic HF with LVEF <50% and NYHA Classes II –IV.
ID or mild anaemia was diagnosed based on a haemoglobin level of 8 –15 g/dL, ferritin <100 ng/mL or be- tween 100 and 300 mg/L, and Tsat <20%. Risk of bias assessment We expressed the quality of each risk of bias item presented as percentages based on the Cochrane risk of bias assess-ment manuals.Brie ﬂy, the ﬁve studies underwent random sequence generation.Only one trial had reported adequate allocation.Furthermore, one trial did not use blinding,whereas two trials were double-blinded, one of which had merely completed a blinded assessment of the outcomes.In addition, two trials had incomplete outcome data, and selec-tive reporting was identi ﬁed.
No other signi ﬁcant biases were noted during quality assessment ( Figure 2).Oral iron supplementation in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis 2781 ESC Heart Failure 2022; 9: 2779 –2786 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.14020 Adverse effects on oral iron supplementation To evaluate the safety of oral iron therapy, we analysed all-cause death, adverse events, and gastrointestinal side effects. Three studies reported data for all-cause death,and no heterogeneity was observed across them (I 2= 25%, P= 0.26).Assembling the evidence via the ﬁxed-effects model revealed no signi ﬁcant difference in all-cause death between the oral iron and placebo groups (RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46 –1.29, Z = 0.98; P= 0.33) ( Figure 3A).Two trials reported statistical data for adverse events, which showed no statistical heterogeneity ( I2= 36%, P= 0.21).
In summary, analysis of the safety outcome con- ﬁrmed that the incidence rate of adverse effects was not statistically signi ﬁcant (RR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60 –1.16, Z = 1.07; P= 0.28) ( Figure 3B). Iron storage status and cardiac function We assessed whether haematological parameters were im- proved remarkably after oral iron supplementation.The ferritin levels and Tsat were pooled and showed a slightincrease after iron complex administration (ferritin: MD = 2.70, 95% CI, /C02.41 –7.81, Z = 1.04; P= 0.30; Tsat: MD = 27.42, 95% CI, /C04.93 –59.78, Z = 1.66; P= 0.10) (Figure 4Aand 4B), but neither showed signi ﬁcant differ- ences.The 6MWT, which was assessed in two trials, showed statistically signi ﬁcant heterogeneity ( I2= 92%, P<0.00001).After summarizing the results using the random-effects model, no signi ﬁcant difference was found (MD = 59.60, 95% CI, /C017.89 –137.08, Z = 1.51; P= 0.13) (Figure 4C).
Sensitivity analysis In addition to the clinical trials, we included two well- designed, non-random control trials for sensitivity analysis to increase statistical samples and acquire more reliableresults. 19Two articles described statistics on gastrointestinal adverse effects, and the heterogeneity from them diverged (I2= 79%, P= 0.03).Eleven (23.4%) candidates in the experi- mental group had gastrointestinal side effects, whereas the incidence in the control group is 18.4% (nine candidates).Synthesis analysis indicated that the oral iron administrationgroup did not show a signi ﬁcant increase in gastrointestinal adverse effects.After adding the two studies, no changes were found in 6MWT and all adverse events.
However, signif-icant changes in ferritin levels were observed ( I 2= 88%, P<0.0001) (MD = 28.87, 95% CI 1.62 –56.12, Z = 2.08; P= 0.04) ( Figure 5).Table 1 The baseline characteristics of the studies included are presented Study AreaFemale, total Age (y) EF; NYHAFollow-up (w) Drug; dosageIron de ﬁciency and anaemia(ferritin; Tsat; Hb) Results evaluation Beck-da-Silva 2013 Porto Alegre, Brazil 4/13 63.5 ± 16.2 aLVEF<40%; NYHA: II –IV8 Ferrous sulfate; 200 mg, tid<500μg/L; Tsat <20%; Hb: 9 –12 (g/dL)Hb; ferritin, Tsat; VO 2 Suryani 2017 Jakarta, Indonesia NA/54 18 –75 LVEF <50%; NYHA: II –III12 Ferrous sulfate; 200 mg, tid<100μg/L, 100 – 300μg/L (Tsat <20%); Hb: 8 –13 g/dL (F: 12 g/ dL)Hb, ferritin, Tsat; NT- proBNP; 6MWT Lewis 2017 Massachusetts, USA 80/225 63 (median) LVEF ≤40%; NYHA: II –III16 Iron polysaccharide; 150 mg, bid<100μg/L, 100 – 300μg/l (Tsat <20%); Hb: 9 –15 g/dL (F: 13.5 g/dL)TIBC, Tsat, sTfR; NT- proBNP; VO 2, KCCQ, 6MWT Sagita 2017 Jakarta, Indonesia NA/37 NA LVEF <50%; NYHA: NA12 Ferrous sulfate; NA<100μg/L, 100 – 300μg/L (Tsat <20%); Hb:<13 g/dLGLS Snezana 2019 Nis, Serbia 79/201 73.31 ± 9.766 70.76 ± 9.811NA NYHA: II –IV26 Ferrous fumarate; 350 mg, bid<100 mg/L (Tsat <20%) NAHb, ferritin, Tsat; 6MWT 6MWT, 6-min walk test; bid, bis in der; GLS, global longitudinal train; Hb, haemoglobin; Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; LVEF, left ventr icular ejection fraction; NA, not avail- able; NT-proBNP, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide; NYHA, New York Heart Association functional class; sTfR, soluble transferrin recepto r; TIBC, total iron binding capacity; tid, ter in der; Tsat, transferrin saturation; VO 2, volume of oxygen consumption.

Tang et al .ESC Heart Failure 2022; 9: 2779 –2786 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.14020 Discussion Main ﬁndings Our meta-analysis included studies comparing oral iron treat- ment with placebo or blank treatment in populations with HF with ID or mild anaemia.Our results reveal that oral iron is ineffective in improving the quality of life and exercise capacity of patients with HF with ID or mild anaemia.However, oral iron supplementation can improve iron storage status.More importantly, our ﬁndings indicate that oral iron therapy had no impact on adverse effects and all-cause death.This study is the ﬁrst to examine the safety and ef ﬁcacy of oral iron in patients with HF with ID anaemia.
The gastroin- testinal canal of patients with HF is more susceptible to in- jury, and iron itself may have a negative effect on the gastro- intestinal tract.27However, compared with the control arm, no increase in adverse events was observed after oral iron intervention in the experimental group. Hence, the results in- dicate that oral iron supplementation is suf ﬁciently harmless to patients with HF and can be considered safe for use.Iron, as the essential component of haemoglobin and the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex, plays an indispensable role in the oxygen-carrying function and electron transport for ATP generation of the blood.28,29Figure 2 Risk bias assessment results.Figure 3 Forest plot displaying (A) all-cause death and (B) adverse events on oral iron administration to HF patients with ID or anaemia.
Oral iron supplementation in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis 2783 ESC Heart Failure 2022; 9: 2779 –2786 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.14020 Current experimental evidence indicates that appropriate iron supplementation can ameliorate muscle function and exercise capacity in animals, suggesting the function of iron as a co-factor in skeletal and cardiac muscles.30,31The results of the analysis reveal that ferritin levels and Tsat showed a slight but non-signi ﬁcant increase. Therefore, oral iron treatment has a negligible effect on complementing iron stores, whichcan help improve aerobic exercise and increase high quality of life.However, the sensitivity analysis showed that oral iron signiﬁcantly improved patients ’ferritin levels.Recent studies have reported that oral iron is effective in treating ID symp- toms in patients with HF compared with intravenous iron supplementation.
32,33 In addition, clinical trials have con ﬁrmed that ID may dam- age O 2transport and utilization and decrease peak O 2con- sumption, eventually leading to exercise intolerance and car-diac function decline in patients with HF. These situations were reversed with intravenous iron therapy.34–36However, this is inconsistent with our current ﬁndings indicating no sig-niﬁcant difference in peak O 2consumption, which is a strong predictive factor of exercise capacity in the HF population.37 Furthermore, the 6MWT and the Kansas City CardiomyopathyQuestionnaire (KCCQ) are unchanged after oral iron adminis-tration.To expand the sample size, we included two non-randomized controlled studies for sensitivity analysis, and the ﬁndings were the same.In consequence, the evi- dence reveals that the application of oral iron fails to alleviate clinical symptoms, increase exercise capacity, and improve quality of life in HF with ID or mild anaemia.
Apart from that,indicators of cardiac structure and systolic function were not ameliorated after oral iron administration, for example. 38 In the studies analysed, oral iron supplementation was ad- ministered at 200 –600 mg per day, which is 10 –20-fold the ab- sorption capacity for oral iron after accounting for limited gas- trointestinal tract intake.More surprisingly, the total oral irondosage in the IRON-HF trial was approximately 38-fold that for intravenous iron.16,17Nevertheless, the ef ﬁcacy of oral iron supplementation on iron storage status lags far behind intra-Figure 4 Forest plot displaying (A) the Tsat and (B) the ferritin level after oral iron supplementation.(C) The 6MWT in HF patients with ID or anaemia.Figure 5 Forest plot showing the sensitivity analysis on the ferritin level at the end of follow-up.2784 M.Tang et al .

As previouslystated, gastrointestinal tract digestive and absorptive func- tions are impaired in the HF population, and massive oral iron can aggravate the injury, leading to excessive iron loss.Hepcidin is a crucial factor regulating iron absorption, and in- creased hepcidin levels will inhibit iron absorption and utilization.40,41The IRONOUT trial showed very high baseline levels of hepcidin, which may suppress the Tsat and ferritin in- crease after oral iron supplementation, thereby restricting iron uptake in the skeletal muscle and cardiomyocytes.42In addi- tion, a follow-up duration of 2 –4 months is short, which may have limited our evaluation.Limitations Our meta-analysis has some limitations.
First, only a small number of studies were included, and high-quality trials arelacking. In addition, we were unable to gather more informa- tion for the assessment of prognosis as expected, for example, LVEF, re-hospitalization and long-term mortality.In addition,the de ﬁnition of mild anaemia and ID is one of the limitations varied across the studies, and no standard recommendations exist on target Tsat, ferritin, and haemoglobin levels.Further-more, we were unable to conduct sub-group analyses on anae- mia status and NYHA class due to the limited data.Conclusions Ourﬁndings show that oral iron supplementation can safely improve iron storage status.However, oral iron supplementa- tion in the HF population with ID or mild anaemia is ineffec-tive in improving Tsat and 6MWT.The clinical trials on oral iron administration in HF with ID or anaemia are still very few.Therefore, further well-designed RCTs involving multiplecentres and nationalities are still required.
Furthermore, as ourﬁndings indicate, we recommend that ongoing and future trials should have long-term follow-up and should examineanaemic status, ID levels (based on ferritin and Tsat), NYHA class, and LVEF.
