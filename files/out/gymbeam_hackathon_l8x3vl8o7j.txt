Stem cells interact with their niche or to other stem cells via adhesion molecules that eventually transduce mechanical cues to maintain their homeostatic function. Here, we present a comprehensive reviewon our current understanding of the in ﬂuence of the forces perceived by cell adhesion molecules on the regulation of stem cells.Additionally, we provide insights on how this deeper understanding of mechanobiology of stem cells hastranslated toward therapeutics.KEYWORDS mechanotransduction, stem cell niche, adhesion molecules, adherens junctions, focal adhesion, disease and regenerative therapeutics 1 Introduction Regenerative Medicine, which deals with the restoration of tissues/organs upon injury or chronic disease, is a promising and emerging branch of medical research ( Mason and Dunnill, 2008 ;Mahla, 2016 ).
It is well known that stem cells in our body hold the capability of self-renewal and differentiation into other types of cells, which makes it an ideal candidate for regenerative medicine. Though the term stem cell (original: ‘Stammzelle ’) appeared in the scienti ﬁc literature in the mid-19th century by famous German biologist Ernst Haeckel ( Haeckel, 1868 ); major breakthroughs in the stem cell research only happened a century later.However, over the past 20 years, there have been immense advancements in the ﬁeld of stem cell research, in elucidating their characteristics and potential for regenerative medicine ( Mahla, 2016 ;Liu et al., 2020 ).Although there are different types of stem cells, they all share common characteristics of self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into different cell types.

Stem cells isolated from the epiblast stage of embryos are termed epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) and primordial germ cells (embryogenic germ cells EGCs) (Shamblott et al., 1998 ;Yu and Thomson, 2008 ). In contrast to ESCs, adult stem cells are found in various tissues and are alternatively termed as somatic stem cells ( Leblond, 1964 ;Robey, 2000 ).Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were amongst the ﬁrst identi ﬁed adult stem cells and the most widely studied ( Seita & Weissman, 2010 ).Some of the tissues where pools of adult stem cells have been identi ﬁed include 1) The nervous system which includes parts of brain, 2) Bone marrow and blood which consist of bone marrow, peripheral blood, dental pulp and spinal cord, blood vessels, 3) Endothelial Progenitor Cells, 4) Skeletal MuscleStem Cells, 5) Epithelial Cell Precursors in the Skin and Digestive System as well as from parts of cornea, retina, liver, and pancreas.
These tissue speci ﬁc stem cells (TSSCs) behave differently depending on their local environment and the homeostatic requirement of the body. Stem cells (SCs) often reside in tissue-speci ﬁc microenvironments termed as the stem cell niche, that play an important role in regulating the proliferation and differentiationof these cells, thereby maintain tissue homeostasis ( Schoﬁeld, 1978 ).The concept and signi ﬁcance of the stem cell niche was ﬁrst proposed by Schol ﬁeld in 1978, when he demonstrated that removing these cells from their niche resulted in their differentiation ( Schoﬁeld, 1978 ).Stem cell fates are regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.Cell-intrinsic factorsinclude speci ﬁc transcription factors, microRNAs, epigenetic regulators and secreted signaling molecules such as Wnts and BMPs ( Watt and Hogan, 2000 ;Nusse, 2008 ;Gangaraju and Lin, 2009 ;Wang and Wagers, 2011 ;Li et al., 2017 ;Chacón-Martínez et al., 2018 ;Rigillo et al., 2021 ).
Extrinsic factors include the regulation of stem cells with through cell-cell and cell-substratuminteractions ( Watt and Huck, 2013 ;Gattazzo et al., 2014 ). In addition to the above-mentioned niche factors, mechanical signals originating from cell-intrinsic and externally applied forces also have major implications on the behavior of the SCs ( Vining and Mooney, 2017 ).Force generation by actomyosin contractility and cytoskeletal assembly impinge onmechanisms by which the cells exert intrinsic forces on its extracellular milieu and neighboring cells.In contrast, cell- extrinsic forces arise from the rigidity, topography andcomposition of the ECM that exerts shear, tensile and compressive forces on the stem cells ( Lo et al., 2000 ;Even- Ram et al., 2006 ;Dupont et al., 2011 ;Li et al., 2011 ;Wolfenson et al., 2019 ).
Transmission of these mechanical forces through cell-cell junctions and cell-substratum adhesions plays a key rolein regulating intracellular signaling pathways, eventually determining stem cell fate ( Vining and Mooney, 2017 ). Although the role of cell-intrinsic factors and signaling molecules regulating the quiescence of the stem cells havebeen extensively studied, the mechanical function of the cell- cell adhesion molecules in maintaining the stem cell homeostasis is less well explored.Cells typically sense and transmit externalforces to specialized structures at the cell periphery.These structures then transduce the forces into a biochemically detectable signal, and ultimately the response of the cell istranscribed by the nucleus.These are commonly referred to as mechanotransmission, mechanosensing, and mechanoresponse, respectively or as a whole, mechanotransduction ( Ingber, 2006 ; Jansen et al., 2017 ).
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of biophysical attributes of the microenvironment, including mechanical loading and substrate material property, indetermining the self-renewal and commitment of SCs required for its maintenance and differentiation respectively. External forces applied to the SCs from its niche generates tractionforces as well as compressive forces through the cytoskeleton.These forces are then transmitted from the cytoskeleton to other cellular components inside or outside of the SCs.This concept of organizing and stabilizing the cytoskeleton by the living cells in response to applied external forces is based on the model oftensegrity, which was ﬁrst described by D.Ingber ( Chen and Ingber, 1999 ;Ingber, 2003 ).The cellular tensegrity model describes the cell as a mechanical force bearing structure thatis composed of compression resistant components and tension bearing cables.
These cables create a pre-stress state in the cell, which is opposed by the compression resistant componentsknown as struts, that aids in the maintenance of the mechanical equilibrium of the cell. This tenseg rity-based model highlights the integration of cytoplasmic mech anotransduction and biological responses that are critical for determining the proliferative and differentiative characteristics of SCs, gene expression, as well as its role in organ development ( Chowdhury et al., 2010 ;Engler et al., 2004;2006).The 2 cell junctions that regulate mechanotransduction of the SCs within its niche are, the cadherin mediated Adherens Junctions (AJs) and the integrin mediated Focal Adhesions (FAs).
2 Role of extracellular matrix molecule and adhesion molecules in regulating mechanotransduction of stem cell niche 2.1 Extracellular matrix and matrix metalloproteinases as a niche factor 2.1.1 Extracellular matrix The ECM comprises of noncellular components surrounding all the cells in the body, and provides mechanical support via a structural macromolecular network ( Murphy-Ullrich & Sage, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 02Lim et al. 10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 2014 ;Theocharis et al., 2016 ;Stanton et al., 2019 ).Mechanical cues from the ECM help to regulate cell phenotypes, motility,biochemistry and matrix production and therefore plays an essential role in tissue remodeling ( Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009 ;Akhmanova et al., 2015 ).
The components of the ECM that mediate signaling in cells include: collagen, elastin, laminin, ﬁbronectin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and syndecans, as well as soluble components such as cytokines,matrix metalloproteinases, growth factors and proteases (Figure 1 )(Hynes, 2009 ;Mohammed et al., 2019 ). Thephysical properties of the ECM such as its rigidity, viscosity, porosity and topography are in ﬂuenced by the concentration, type, and arrangement of macromolecules ( ﬁbers, proteoglycans and glycoproteins).As a result, the ECM may present as a soft or hard substrate ( Yue, 2014 ;Jansen et al., 2015 ).Multiple studies have suggested the role of ECM stiffness as a major regulatory physical factor in determining stem cell fate ( Discher et al., 2005 ; Paszek et al., 2005 ;Engler et al., 2006 ;Even-Ram et al., 2006 ; Hamidouche et al., 2009 ;Li et al., 2011 ;Gandavarapu et al., 2014 ).
FIGURE 1 Highlights the cell adhesion molecules present at cell-cell and cell-substratum junctions in epithelial cells. Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 03Lim et al.10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 2.1.1.1 Collagen About 30% of the total protein mass in mammals is constituted by collagen, which is also one of the most abundant components of the ECM ( Shoulders and Raines, 2009 ;Ricard-Blum, 2011 ).The collagen super family comprises 28 members with at least 46 distinct polypeptide chains in vertebrates ( Brinckmann, 2005 ).The primary component of the ECM in vertebrates is collagen I, which consists of stiff, thick and long ﬁbrils that contribute to the structural architecture, shape and mechanical properties oftissues such as tensile strength in skin and resistance to traction in ligaments ( Ricard-Blum, 2011 ).Different collagen types are reported to perform tissue-speci ﬁc functions.
For example, collagen XXII which is present only at tissue junctions (skeletal and heart muscles) and in the skin epithelia acts as an adhesion ligand ( Koch et al., 2004 ). Collagen XIII in bone regulates its formation by coupling bone mass to mechanical use ( Ylönen et al., 2005 ) and collagen VII in skin is critical for maintaining dermal-epidermal adhesion, thus affecting its integrity ( Bruckner- Tuderman et al., 1987 ).Collagen in the ECM of the stem cell niche plays an important role in determining the proliferative and differentiation potential of the stem cells.Studies have s h o w nt h a tt y p eI Vc o l l a g e ni nt h eb a s e m e n tm e m b r a n e and hair follicles of the skin p rovides mechanical support as well as an increase in the proliferative potential of normalhuman basal keratinocytes ( Breitkreutz et al., 2013 ;Choi et al., 2014 ).
Likewise, in muscle stem cells (satellite cells), alterations of muscle stiffness which is mediated by collagen VI deposition by ﬁbroblasts affects the self-renewal and maintenance of these stem cells ( Urciuolo et al., 2013 ). The mechanical microenvironment of the intestinal cryptcells has been shown to be primarily regulated by type VI collagen via its interaction with the RGD domain of ﬁbronectin ( Groulx et al., 2011 ;Benoit et al., 2012 ).Altered tissue stiffness in the intestinal crypt cells is associated with increased type VI collagen secretion into the basal lamina.This alteration of the tissue stiffness, inturn, affects integrin focal adhesions, growth factor receptor signaling and acto-myosin and cytoskeletal-dependent cellular contractility ( Handorf et al., 2015 ).
Collagen has also been shown to support stem cell properties such as clonogenicity, cell growth and osteogenic differentiation potential ( Chen et al., 2007 ;Linsley et al., 2013 ;Somaiah et al., 2015 ;Akhir and Teoh, 2020 ). The absence of collagen III in mice affects osteoblast differentiation ( Volk et al., 2014 ) whereas the denaturation of collagen I promotes osteoblastic differentiation ( Tsai et al., 2010 ).Taken together, these studies suggested that the structural i n t e g r i t yc o n f e r r e db yc o l l a g e ni nt h eE C Mi si m p l i c a t e din the fate of stem cell proliferation and differentiation in different niches.2.1.1.2 Elastin Another important component factor of the ECM along with collagen are the elastin networks that are predominantly found in soft elastic tissues like the skin, blood vessels and lungs(Rosenbloom et al., 1993 ; Li & Daggett, 2002 ).Elastin is formed from its monomer, tropoelastin.
Tropoelastin is crosslinked at its lysine residues, thereby forming elastic ﬁbers along with micro ﬁbrillar proteins such as ﬁbrillin. These elastic ﬁbers are the major contributors to the mechanical properties of elastin ( Aaron and Gosline, 1981 ;Ozsvar et al., 2015 ).Elastin is predominantly deposited during prenatal development and childhood and is rarely synthesized during adulthood ( Ozsvar et al., 2015 ).90% of elastin comprises elastic ﬁbers, with the remaining 10% consisting of ﬁbrillin glycoprotein ( Mecham, 1991 ).The primary role of these elastic ﬁbers is to undergo constant stretch-recoil cycles, thus maintaining the structuraland functional integrity of the elastic tissues throughout the organism ’s lifetime ( Ozsvar et al., 2015 ).Studies have shown that tropoelastin can promote cell attachment and migration of various cell types such as ﬁbroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells ( Ozsvar et al., 2015 ).
Additionally, tropoelastin has been shown to interact and bind with one of the major cell adhesion proteins, integrins, to promote proliferation in MSCs and HSCs.Speci ﬁcally, elastin ’s interaction with ɑvβ3 and ɑvβ5 integrins on the surface of MSCs, either as surface-bound or as soluble tropoelastin, promotes MSC proliferation. This was attributedto the ability of elastin to convey mechanical signals and modulate gene expression that supports proliferation ( Rodgers and Weiss, 2004 ;Yeo and Weiss, 2019 ).Tropoelastin-integrin interactions partially contribute to the wound healing process by remodeling the ECM ( Ozsvar et al., 2021 ).Likewise, in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, mechanicalcharacteristics of tropoelastin in the ECM has been shown to be associated with its differentiation ( Holst et al., 2010 ).The tunable elasticity of elastin plays an important role in regulatingcell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and migration.
2.1.1.3 Laminin Laminins are a family of large multidomain, heterotrimeric glycoproteins that are composed of three different subunits, the α,β, and γchains. These chains are encoded by 11 genes in humans and form at least 15 trimeric combinations of subunits throughout different tissues ( Aumailley et al., 2005 ).Different combinations of these three subunits confer upon laminins itsnomenclature.For example, laminin composed of α2,β1, and γ1 chains is laminin 211 and so on ( Kaur and Reinhardt, 2015 ).Each laminin subunit consists of tandem LE repeats (laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like domains), globular domains interspersed within the LE domains and an α-helical domain which follows after the LE repeats ( Beck et al., 1990 ;Hamill et al., 2009 ).The α-helical domains of the α,β, and γsubunits wind around each other to produce a trimeric coiled-coil structure Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 04Lim et al.
10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 (Beck et al., 1990 ). Laminins (with other components) maintain the structural and functional integrity of the ECM, ultimately affecting cell viability ( Armony et al., 2016 ).Additionally, laminins also in ﬂuence cell adhesion and migration (Domogatskaya et al., 2012 ).Laminins are well known for regulating different stem cell functions such as cell-substratum adhesion, proliferation,migration and differentiation ( Iorio et al., 2015 ).However, there are very few in-vivo reports that highlight the mechanical properties of lami nin in maintaining stem cell function.In contrast, in-vitro studies that modulate substrate stiffness and ligand compositio n to mimic the native elasticity o ft h es t e mc e l ln i c h e sh a v eh i g h l ighted the role of laminin as a stem cell niche factor.
For example, satellite cell renewal from skeletal muscle was promoted when cultured on laminin crosslinked hydrogels (with a stiffness of ~12 kPa) which mimics the native elasticity of skeletal muscles. This study further reported that muscl e satellite cells cultured on laminin functionalized hydr ogels contributed to muscle regeneration when grafted into immune de ﬁcient mice that partially lacked endogenous satellite cells ( Gilbert et al., 2010 ).Different isoforms of laminin have been shown to be able to direct the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into multiple eye-like tissues.Of note, theE8 fragments of laminin 511 ena bles the dense concentration of hiPSCs colonies due to actomyosin contraction, which results in cell density YAP inactivation and ultimatelyleading to retinal different iation in these colony centers (Shibata et al., 2018 ).
Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) differentiation toward s the oligodendrocyte lineage have been shown to be favored when cultured on laminin coated substrate over ﬁbronectin coated substrate and along with mechanical stimulation by s ubjecting the cells to a single static stretch ( Arulmoli et al., 2015 ). This oligodendrocyte lineage speci ﬁc differentiation is pref erentially mediated by the integrin α6 laminin binding.These ﬁndings correlate with what is known in vivo as laminin is found in high concentrations in a developin g brain and is also expressed in the NSPC niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ) of thelateral ventricles and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in an adult brain ( Chen et al., 2003 ;Lathia et al., 2007 ;Relucio et al., 2012 ).
Thus, mechanical forces resulting from robust cell movements during development and tissue folding of the brain may thus be implicated together with laminin in the ECM to direct NSPC differentiation towards the oligodendrocytelineage within this niche. 2.1.1.4 Fibronectin Fibronectin (FN) is a large 440 kDa, multidomain, dimeric glycoprotein which is found in the extracellular milieu of different tissues ( Proctor, 1987 ;Parisi et al., 2020 ).It is composed of two identical subunits that are joined together by disul ﬁde bonds near the C-terminal regions.Each subunitmonomer consists of three different types of repeats, namely FNI, FNII and FNIII ( Hynes, 1986 ;Pankov and Yamada, 2002 ; To and Midwood, 2011 ;Adams et al., 2015 ).FN exists in both soluble and insoluble forms .The soluble FN, also known as plasma ﬁbronectin, circulates in the blood and contributes primarily to tissue repair by forming ﬁbrin blood clots ( To and Midwood, 2011 ).
On the other hand, the insoluble FN, also known as cellular FN, is found on cell surfaces and in the ECM (Proctor, 1987 ;To and Midwood, 2011 ). FN is also considered as the ‘master organizer ’o ft h eE C Ms i n c ei th e l p si no r g a n i z i n g other matrix proteins such as collagen, heparin, ﬁbrillin and ﬁbulins ( Morla and Ruoslahti, 1992 ;Chung and Erickson, 1997 ; Klass et al., 2000 ;Woods, 2001 ;Galante and Schwarzbauer, 2007 ;Kaur and Reinhardt, 2015 ).The tripeptide sequence Arg- Gly-Asp or RGD present on the FNIII repeat, binds to different integrin subunits and aids in the assembly of FN ( Goodman, 2021 ).These non-covalent interactions help in forming a matured FN network.Interaction of FN with cell surface receptors such as integrins and syndecans aid in cell adhesion and migration as well as determining cell shape and differentiation.
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs ) are known to utilize their own contractile forces and translate environmental cues such as variations in substrate rigidit y into differential biochemical signals with the help of stretched FN ﬁbers. hMSCs mediated osteogenesis was shown to be increased upon inhibition of αvβ3 integrin on relaxed FN ﬁbers whereas osteogenesis was decreased upon inhibition of αvβ1 on stretched FN ﬁbers.Thus, the mechanical strain of these FN ﬁbers serves as a checkpoint, where they act as a crucial mechano-chemicalsignal converter that help the hMSCs to differentiate ( Li et al., 2013 ).Osteogenic differentiation is known to be enhanced with increasing higher substrate stiffness ranging from 0.7 to 80 kPa.Interestingly, when polyacrylamide gels were coated with ﬁbronectin, it stimulated osteogenic differentiation even at a lower s ubstrate stiffness of 25 kPa, at a comparable differentiati on rate to that of 80 kPa.
These studies indicate that the mechanical properties of ECM components like ﬁbronectin might play a signi ﬁcant role in determining the fate of stem cells ( Rowlands et al., 2008 ). In embryonic stem cells (ES) ﬁbronectin-mediated upregulation of the expression αvβ1 has been shown to promote the fate of cells towards a meso-e ndodermal lineage ( Hayashi et al., 2007 ; Pimton et al., 2011 ).Additionally, in adult stem cells, ﬁbronectin can promote differentiation towards a skeletal lineage as opposed to an adipogenic fate ( Ogura et al., 2004 ; Martino et al., 2009 ;Wang et al., 2010 ).Interestingly, when differentiated 3T3 adipo cytes were cultured on ﬁbronectin, a reduction in the lipogenic g ene expression was observed, suggesting that ﬁbronectin also affects the fate of these cells (Spiegelman and Ginty, 1983 ).In mammalian skin, FN is also known to contribute to the wound healing process.
The FN pericellular matrix assembled by ﬁbroblasts senses strain Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 05Lim et al. 10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 caused by a disruption in tensile homeostasis during wounding.Mechanically regulated inter action between FN and collagen drives the deposition of collagen over FN matrices at the wound bed, which protects the FN matrix from themicroenvironmental forces ( Patten and Wang, 2021 ).Although it is known that the interaction between FN and collagen is mechanically regulated, the mechanism for theunfolding of the FN ﬁbrils is less well understood ( Gee et al., 2008 ;Ponmurugan and Vemparala, 2012 ;Früh et al., 2015 ;Szymanski et al., 2017a ;Szymanski et al., 2017b ).
2.1.2 Matrix metalloproteinases Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that cleave components of the E CM such as collagen and laminin, and play an important role in embryonic development, morphogene sis and tissue remodeling (Brenner et al., 1989 ;Matrisian and Hogan, 1990 ; Woessner, 1991 ;Tyagi et al., 1995 ). MMPs are a growing family of metallo endopeptidases and can be classi ﬁed as collagenases, gelatinases, st romelysins, matrilysins and, enamelysins ( Jabłońska-Trypu ćet al., 2016 ).During development, MMPs help in regulating biophysical cues by degrading and modulating the stiffness of the ECM in different s t e mc e l ln i c h e ss u c ha sM S C sa n dH S C s( Caiazzo et al., 2016 ; Saw et al., 2019 ).MSCs play an active and signi ﬁcant role in bone regeneration due to their ability to migrate to injured sites and differentiate into osteocytes.
Additionally, MMPs arealso involved in bone regener ation as it has been shown that inhibition of MMPs, in particular MMP-13, led to perturbations in the migration, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation capabilities of the MSCs ( Kasper et al., 2007 ). It was further demonstrated in the same study that mechanical loading also played a role in regulating the expression ofMMPs, which may be an important factor in regulating levels of MMPs to direct MSC osteogenic differentiation.The conditional ablation of MMP-14 from mouse dermalﬁbroblasts results in enhanced accumulation of collagen I in the ECM, resulting in a ﬁbrotic skin condition associated with an increase in stiffness and tensile strength.
This studysuggested that MMP-14 contributes to collagen remodeling in adult skin, and plays a crucial role in maintaining dermal homeostasis ( Zigrino et al., 2016 ).The migration of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and progenitors to appropriate sites require physical interaction with its niche ( Smith, et al., 2017 ). During this migration, cells experience mechanical resistance from the matrix, causing the cells to escape from their basement membrane.This process requires the expression of MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-14) from muscleprogenitors to degrade the ECM in their path of migration (Wang et al., 2009 ;Xiaoping and Yong, 2009 ;Lund et al., 2014 ).
Taken together, these studies show that MMPs play a critical role in modulating th e physical properties of ECM to affect a variety of stem cell functions.2.2 Cell-substrate adhesions as niche factor In multicellular organisms, adhesion molecules help to maintain tissue architecture, generate forces for cell movement and ensure the functionality of tissues by creating barriers (Vleminckx, 2017 ). Adhesion molecules bind to various ligands and receptors and the resulting signals are critical to many physiological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, contact inhibition and apoptosis ( Vleminckx, 2017 ).The cytoplasmic domain of adhesion molecules bind indirectly to the cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and intermediate ﬁlaments, whereas their extracellular domain, via homophilic orheterophilic adhesion, interact with adhesion receptors on neighboring cells or ECM ligands.
Furthermore, these adhesion molecules often cluster at speci ﬁc restricted areas in the membrane, commonly termed as junctional complexes. The linkage to the cytoskeleton coupled with its clustering enhances the strength of adhesion forces nucleated by these adhesionmolecules.Adhesion molecules are classi ﬁed into ﬁve major groups based on their mode of interaction, function, structure and location.These groups are integrins, cadherins, selectins, proteoglycans and the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (Samanta and Almo, 2015 ;Vleminckx, 2017 ).In this section, we will focus on the role of integrins, involved in cell-ECM interactions via the focal adhesions (FA) and cadherin, that mediate cell-cell interactions at the adherens junction (AJ) instem cell functions.
Junction complexes induced by cadherin and integrins can initiate signal transduction that facilitates niche signaling, in turn regulating stem cell properties such as self-renewal, proliferation and survival ( Chen et al., 2013 ). The role of mechanical signals in regulating stem cell function, has been recently reviewed ( Shih et al., 2011 ;Vining and Mooney, 2017 ; Naqvi and McNamara, 2020 ).However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the mechanical activation of adhesion molecules and their roles in regulating stem cell fateare still less well understood.2.2.1 Integrin Integrins are transmembrane heterodimeric receptors consisting of αand βsubunits that function as a mechanical link between the cellular cytoskeleton and the ECM ( Figure 1 ) (Sun et al., 2016 ).The engagement of integrins with their extracellular ligands initiates intracellular biochemical responses ( Hynes, 1992 ;Arnaout et al., 2007 ).
In mammals, there are eight β-subunits and 18 α-subunits resulting in 24 distinct integrin receptors ( Hynes, 2002 ). These receptors bind to different ECM ligands such as laminin, ﬁbronectin and collagen IV, with speci ﬁc heterodimers playing important roles in stem cell maintenance in different tissue niches.For example, α2integrin regulates the osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs and is upregulated in MSCs plated on stiffer matrices (42.1 kPa).On the other hand, the knockdown of α2integrin in these MSCs Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 06Lim et al.10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 decreased osteogenic induction, suggesting a role for this integrin in mechanotransduction during osteogenic differentiation ( Shih et al., 2011 ).
The reduction in quiescence of neural stem cells (NSCs) is associated with a lower expression of β1 integrin, which, in turn, results in a reduced interaction of the β1 integrin on the NSCs to the laminin-rich microenvironment ( Shen et al., 2008 ;Nascimento et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, bifunctional hydrogels with different stiffnesses (2 and 20 kPa) that are engineered with laminin peptide (IKVAV) and poly-lysine led to neurogenesis in embryonic cortical progenitors and adultNSCs respectively via β1 integrin.These data suggest that substrate stiffness and ligand speci ﬁcity of integrin contribute to different stem cell behavior ( Farrukh et al., 2017 ).Although integrin is a well-known mechanotransmitter, integrin-mediated mechanosensing in regulating the stem cell microenvironment is still being explored.2.2.2 Integrin-associated proteins Focal adhesions (FAs) are one of the key junctions involved in mechanosensing at the cell periphery.
FAs comprise multimeric protein complexes which integrate both inside-out and outside-in signals and involve both mechanical and biochemical cues to regulate cellular functions ( Vogel and Sheetz, 2006 ;Schiller and Fässler, 2013 ;Oakes and Gardel, 2014 ). FAs are nucleated by integrin receptors that form a mechanical link between the cytoskeleton and the ECM (Kanchanawong et al., 2010 ).Initially, integrins bind to the ligands found in the matrix, following which the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin subunit recruits multiple intracellular ancho ring proteins such as talin, kindlin, paxillin, FAK, ILK, tensin etc ( Figure 1 ).This anchorage can either result in the recruitment of vinculin, further linking this complex to t he actin cytoskeleton, or result in direct engagement with the actin cytoskeleton ( Alberts et al., 2002 ).Perturbations of these integrin-associated proteins have revealed their cri tical role in maintaining the stem cell niche.
Talin is an integrin-associated protein that is critical for integrin activation at the FA ( Chinthalapudi et al., 2018 ). The lack of talin in embryonic stem cells in mice leads to the failure in the association of integrin with the cytoskeleton, resulting in embryonic lethality during gastrulation.This defect arises due toperturbed cell migration and cytoskeletal organization in the stem cell niche ( Monkley et al., 2000 ).On the other hand, knockdown of talin in the testis results in disrupted adhesionwithin the germline stem cell (GSC) niche of Drosophila.This niche comprises stromal hub cells, GSCs and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs).The adhesion between the hub cells and GSCs isrequired to maintain the undifferentiated state of GSCs, therefore the knock down of talin leads to an accumulation of differentiated GSCs ( Raymond et al., 2009 ).A similar study in C.
elegans showed that talin plays an important role in organizing the cytoskeleton, stabilizing adhesive contacts in muscle andmodulating dynamic integrin signaling during migration ( Cram et al., 2003 ). Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a focal adhesion protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of integrin βsubunits and links them to the actin cytoskeleton.In the hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) niche, studies have pointed to the importance of ILK in maintaining quiescence of these cells.Deletion of ILK from theepidermis resulted in remodeling of the ECM and led to compensatory binding to laminin-511 over laminin-332 due to fragmentation and reduction of the latter.This imbalancecaused an increase in Wnt and Tgf- β2 signaling and led to aberrant differentiation of HFSCs ( Morgner et al., 2015 ).
ILK has also been shown to be a key player during cardiomyogenesis.A decrease in ILK expression by siRNA resulted in a reduction in human fetal cardiomyogenesis, which could be attributed to an enhancement in Wnt signaling ( Traister et al., 2012 ). Although the role of mechanotransduction in fetal cardiomyogenesis has not been directly investigated, it would be interesting to study if these dysregulations are mediated by forces generated by ILK.Lastly, mechanical stimulation of MSCs derived from mouse limb buds led to an increase in activation AKT/mTOR pathway which required ILK, ultimately resulting in an increase in differentiation and collagen expression in the niche of tendon cells ( Mousavizadeh et al., 2020 ).Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is regulated by integrins and functions as a force sensor.
Physically stretching cells causes cellular strain, increasing the force experienced at FAs, therebyactivating FAK by phosphorylation at the Tyr397 residue (Schlaepfer et al., 1994 ;Calalb et al., 1995 ;Polte and Hanks, 1997 ). Forces experienced in focal adhesions are positively correlated with Tyr397 phosphorylated in FAK, suggesting that lower force results in reduced FAK activation ( Torsoni et al., 2003 ).FAK activity is positively regulated by Rho- associated kinases and non-muscle myosin II.Cytoskeletal contractility along with FA formation decreased upon inhibition of the Rho-associated kinases ( Seo et al., 2011 ).FAK activation is required for osteogenic differentiation (Salasznyk et al., 2007 ;Shih et al., 2011 ;Mathieu and Loboa, 2012 ) and is further correlated with myosin II being involved in osteogenic differentiation.
Additionally, force-mediated activation of FAK results in activation of Rho which can then result in force-mediated adult stem cell differentiation(Thompson et al., 2012 ). Tensin is known to interact with actin as well as integrins at the FAs and establishes a crucial connection between thecytoskeletal network and the ECM.Tensin three is widely expressed in tonsil-derived MSCs (TMSCs), where it plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of TMSCsby regulating the levels of β1-integrin ( Park et al., 2019 ).The Ivaska ’s group demonstrated the role of the energy sensor AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) that worked in association withtensin to increase the activity of integrins.Mechanistically, AMPK negatively regulates tensin 1 and tensin 3, which in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 07Lim et al.
10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 the absence of AMPK, binds to β1-integrin, thereby regulating integrin dependent processes like cell adhesion, mechanotransduction and cell matrix formation ( Georgiadou et al., 2017 ). Although not much is known about the role of tensin in mechanotransduction, future studies will be needed to address its role in stem cell homeostasis.Kindlin is a scaffold protein, required for several protein- protein interactions in the FA complex.Recent studies have identi ﬁed Kindlin 2 as a critical mechanosensor in MSCs.Kindlin 2 plays an important role in regulating YAP/TAZexpression and localization to regulate the fate of the MSCs.Mechanistically, kindlin-2 interacts with Myosin Light Chain Kinases (MLCKs), which controls the MSCmicroenvironment and intra cellular signaling through RhoA activation and phosphorylation of MLC.
This interaction controls the actin organization and YAP/TAZphosphorylation, ultimately controlling YAP/TAZ mediated gene expression to regulate the MSC differentiation ( Guo et al., 2018 ). Kindlin-2 is also reported to regulate chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and osteocyte survival.Deleting kindlin-2 from osteocytes, which are the mechanosensors of bone, has been shown to impair bone homeostasis, disrupt FA formatio n, cytoskeletal organization and cell orientation in bone.Loss of kindlin 2 also inducedapoptosis in osteocytes and resulted in the abnormal expression of sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation under mechanical stimulation ( Qin et al., 2021 ).Paxillin is a phosphotyrosine-containing docking protein that is primarily localized to the FA complex ( Glenney and Zokas, 1989 ;Schaller, 2001 ).Paxillin interacts with FAK and other signaling molecules, associated with integrin signaling and membrane traf ﬁcking ( Wade et al., 2002 ).
The mechanosensing properties of paxillin are enabled by itsbinding to activated vinculin that stabilizes the FA- cytoskeleton interaction. Both paxillin null mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and p axillin null differentiated cells display defects in focal adhesion and cell spreading, coupled with an observed reduction in FAK phosphorylation (Wade et al., 2002 ).As studies have only begun to scratch the surface, research demonstrating a direct link between mechanotransduction and ma intenance of the stem cell niche via paxillin requires further investigation.The FA protein vinculin, whi ch is associated with the actin cytoskeleton, is also present at the cell-cell junction (AJ).Vinculin is a well-known mechanotransducer thatdirectly interacts with talin, α-actinin and paxillin at the FAs and α-catenin at the AJs.Various studies have shown the mechanotransduction role of vinculin at the cellular level.
Only a few studies have highlighted the mechanotransduction role of vinculin in maintaining the SC niche. A study by Holle et al.showed that KD of vinculin in hMSCs resulted in areduction of cytoplasmic and FA vinculin ( Holle et al., 2013 ).Vinculin KD also led to a reduction in myoblastdetermination protein 1 (MyoD ) expression in the nucleus.MyoD is the transcription factor which induces stem cell differentiation into a myoblast lineage.Re-expression of the full length or head domain of vinculin was suf ﬁcient to restore MyoD expression allowing cells to return to their myogenic state.Additi onally, vinculin KD cells displayed hampered durotaxis or cell migration towards a stiffer,more myogenic-permissive matrix as opposed to control cells, which assembled preferentially at the myogenic- permissive matrix.
Another tr anscription factor, Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), regulates muscle differentiation along with M y o D .S t u d i e sh a v es h o w nt h a tv i n c u l i nK Dr e s u l t e di nt h e loss of stiffness-mediated expression of MyoD andMyf5 hindering myogenic differentiation. Recently, our group has shown the role of vinculin in maintaining HFSC quiescence ( Biswas et al., 2021 ).Usually HFSCs are maintained in a quiescence state which is achieved by the cell to cell contact mediated inhibition of proliferation ( Fan and Meyer, 2021 ).Conditional KO of vinculin in murine epidermis resulted in mechanically weak AJs which failed to sequester YAP at the junctions and led to increased proliferation of the HFSCs.Mechanistically, our work showed that, in contact-inhibited (quiescent) bulge stem cells, vinculin was critical in maintaining α-catenin in a stretched/open co nformation reinforcing the junction w h i c hi nt u r nk e p tY A Ps e q u estered at the AJs.
These studies highlight the crucial role of mechanotransductionthrough vinculin at the FAs and AJs for maintaining the SCs niche. 2.3 Cell-cell adhesions as niche factor So far, we have discussed how integrins and integrin associated proteins at the FAs play an active role in mechanotransduction.Cells also interact with each other byforming cell-cell junctions incl uding AJs, desmosomes, tight junctions and gap junctions ( Figure 1 ).Among these, AJs are the key adhesion structures that interact with the cytoskeletonof neighboring cells to enable mechanical force transduction (Pannekoek et al., 2019 ).2.3.1 Adherens junction AJs mediate adhesion through homotypic interactions of cadherins such as E-cadherin which are calcium-dependent,transmembrane proteins ( Figure 1 ).E-cadherin associates with the catenin family of proteins such as β-catenin, α- catenin, and p120 via its cytopl asmic domain.
This forms an E-cadherin-catenin complex that interacts with the F-actin cytoskeleton by either direct binding to α-catenin or an indirect association via vinculin ( Koirala et al., 2021 ). AJs regulate cell-cell adhesion within the stem cell niche thereby affecting stem cell fate.Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 08Lim et al.10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 2.3.1.1 E-cadherin E-cadherins are critical to the formation and maintenance of cell junctions, and for the proliferation, survival and differentiation of cells to maintain tissue integrity.Cell-celladhesion mediated by E-cadherin is linked to signaling pathways that transduce signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Stepniak et al., 2009 ).Studies have also shed light on the importance of E-cadherin mediated stem cell niche maintenance in regulating the self-renewal of NSCs (Karpowicz et al., 2009 ).
E-cadherin has also been shown to be crucial in maintaining the pluripotency of mESCs as the d i s r u p t i o ni nE - c a d h e r i nl e a ds to increased Epithelial- Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and differentiation of thesecells ( Redmer et al., 2011 ). The deletion of the E-cadherin gene in mESCs leads to the failure of cell compaction in the embryonic blastocyst that is important for maintaining theepithelial subcellular structures i.e., cellular junctions, during early mammalian development ( Larue et al., 1994 ).Additionally, E-cadherin indu ces conformational changes in α-catenin through the transmission of adhesion forces from the cell-cell junctions.This lea ds to strengthened binding of α- catenin to F-actin and the recr uitment of vinculin to the site where these forces are applied.2.3.1.2 β-catenin In epithelial tissue, β-catenin is one of the crucial components of the AJ, where it links cadherins to thecytoskeleton of the cell, thus establishing cell adhesion.
Subcellular localization of β-catenin is known to determine its function within the cell ( Dietrich et al., 2002 ). When β-catenin localizes in the cytoplasm or nucleus, it functions as a major signaling hub for the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway, where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator of T cell factor/lymphoidenhancer factor family (TCF/LEF) target genes ( Kim et al., 2019 ).β-Catenin also acts as a mechanotransducer ( Benham-Pyle et al., 2016 ), where mechanical cues induce its nuclear accumulation and enhance transcriptional activity ( Benham-Pyle et al., 2015 ).Additionally, it has also been reported that mechanical perturbation of Drosophila embryos causes increased β-catenin signaling and upregulation of its downstream target genes ( Farge, 2003 ).
The Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway is known to respond to ECM stiffness ( Du et al., 2016 ), which ultimately affects cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, genetic stability, apoptosis, and stem cell renewal ( Pai et al., 2017 ). Jansen and co-workers demonstrated that the biphasic effects of mechanical loading on β-catenin resulted in negative effects on Wnt signaling in osteoblastdifferentiation and mineralization ( Jansen et al., 2010 ).Murine embryonic stem ce lls (mESCs) showed enhanced expression of various pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2,Nanog, LIF (also known as mechanopluripotency) when cultured in a stirred suspens ion bioreactor.Mechanicalcues promoted by ﬂuid shear induces the nuclear translocation of β-catenin.This causes a concomitant increase of c-Myc, which is an upstream regulator of these pluripotency markers, ultimately promoting mESCsmechanopluripotency ( Nath et al., 2021 ).
This study indicates that mechanotransduction through the AJ complex is critical for mESC pl uripotency maintenance. In inner ear progenitor cells (IEPCs), external mechanical signals from ECM can be transduced through the RhoA- YAP- β-catenin signaling cascade to regulate its survival, proliferation and differentiation ( Xia et al., 2020 ).Taken together, β-catenin functions as a mechanical regulator that controls cellular functions important for maintainingstem cell homeostasis.2.3.1.3 α-catenin α-Catenin is another key molecule in the AJ, that links to the actin cytoskeleton and the cadherin complex via β-catenin (Niessen & Gottardi, 2008 ).The association of α-catenin with the actin cytoskeleton, allows it to sense the changes in tissue tension during cytoskeletal contraction.
α-Catenin thus acts as a mechanosensor, where it converts mechanical cues into biochemical signals that contro lc e l lp r o l i f e r a t i o na n dc e l l death ( Yonemura et al., 2010 ;Sarpal et al., 2019 ). The Conditional KO of α-catenin in the skin epidermis results in abnormal hair morphogenesis, along with defective AJ formation and cell polarity ( Vasioukhin et al., 2001 ).Additionally, the loss of α-catenin from the epidermis results in hyperproliferation of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and the presence of multinucleated cells.This, in turn, leads to aprecancerous skin condition wit hc h a r a c t e r i s t i c ss i m i l a rt o squamous cell carcinoma.A follow-up study by Vasioukhin ’s group in 2011 showed that speci ﬁc deletion of α-catenin from the HFSC compartment led to the development of squamous cell carcinomas.This was due to the direct interaction of the transcriptional co-activator YAP1 with α-catenin.
The cKO of α-catenin from the HFSC leads to translocation of YAP to the nucleus, thereby promoting cell proliferation and forming pre- cancerous lesions ( Silvis et al., 2011 ). It was later demonstrated that the interaction of 14-3-3 and the PP2A phosphatase with α- catenin led to the phosphorylation of YAP1, sequestering it to the junctions, and prevent ing hyperproliferation ( Schlegelmilch et al., 2011 ).This suggested that α-catenin acts not only as a tumor-suppressor, but also as a se nsor of cell density in the skin.Knockdown of α-catenin in human emb ryonic SCs (hESCs) results in the induction of endodermal differentiation due to ubiquitylation and proteolysis of β-catenin.This inhibits repression of Wnt target genes in the transformed cells(Choi et al., 2013 ).Association of α-catenin with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, a component of the Wnt/ β-catenin pathway, was shown to control the ubiquitination of β-catenin via the APC destruction complex.
Therefore, the reduction of α-catenin Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 09Lim et al. 10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 levels in hESCs leads to a failure in proteolytic destruction of β- catenin, inducing differentiation of the endoderm.Studies on the process of mechano-sensing of α-catenin have only recently started to be investigated.However, the force-dependentconformational change of α-catenin has been shown to activate proteins that facilitate binding with the dynamic actin cytoskeletal network.2.3.1.4 p120 p120 catenin is one of the catenins that interacts with E-cadherin at the AJ ( Reynolds et al., 1994 ;Kourtidis et al., 2013 ).The localization of p120 catenin from the AJ to the cytoplasm upon mechanical stress sensing results in theincreased turnover of E-cadherin, which in turn promotes wing development in Drosophila , suggesting the importance of p120 as a mechanotransducer at the junctions ( Iyer et al., 2019 ).
Several other studies have also described the role of p120 in SC maintenance. During early embryogenesis in mice, p120 null mutant mouse embryonic SCs (mESCs) failed to differentiatecompletely.The absence of p120 in mESCs leads to the destabilization of E-cadherin at the AJs, causing defective formation of the primitive endoderm ( Pieters et al., 2016 ).A study on mESCs by Pierre D.McCrea ’s group showed that p120 catenin negatively regulates a repressive transcriptionalcomplex, RE1-silencing transcription factor/co-repressor (REST/coREST), that plays a critical role in stem cell fate determination.Direct binding of p120 to the REST/coRESTcomplex prevented proper differentiation of the mESCs towards neural fate, thereby uncovering a role for p120 in modulating SC differentiation ( Lee et al., 2014 ).
p120 catenin acts as a mediator in cellular positioning and organ patterning during fate determination of pancreatic progenitors in mice by regulating the differential expression of E-cadherin. This in turndrives cellular motility and directs cells towards speci ﬁc niches to determine their cellular fate ( Nyeng et al., 2019 ).Taken together, p120 not only acts as a mediator for E-cadherin function but alsoplays an important role in lineage commitment.Further studies are required to fully understand how mechanotransduction by p120 regulates the SC niche.2.3.2 Desmosomes Desmosomes are intercellular cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions that couples to the intermediate ﬁlaments and confer mechanical stability when cells are exposed to tensile and mechanical stress ( Figure 1 ).
Speci ﬁcally, desmosomal cadherins are formed by desmogleins 1-4 and desmocollin 1–3, which bind to armadillo proteins plakoglobin and plakophilins via their cytoplasmic tails and subsequentlybinds to intermediate ﬁlaments via Desmoplakin ( Angulo- Urarte et al., 2020 ). The KO of DSG2 results in peri- implantation lethality and also led to a decrease in embryonicstem cell proliferation ( Eshkind et al., 2002 ).DSG2 was shown to be important for regulating the self-renewal and differentiationcapacity of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs).Depletion of DSG2 using monoclonal antibodies in hPSCs resulted in decreased proliferation and reduced expression of pluripotency markers ( Park et al., 2018 ).These results implicate a role of desmosomes in regulating stem cell proliferation and differentiation, however, more work is needed to ascertain how mechanical signals regulate thisprocess.
Different compositions of desmosomes lead to a difference in the strength of cell-cell adhesion in different layers of the skin, which in turn, correlates with differentlevels of proliferation and differentiation. The basal proliferating keratinocytes express desmocollin 2/3 (DSC2/3) and desmoglobin 2/3 (DSG2/3) which displayed the weakestbinding out of all the different desmosomal proteins.In contrast, the differentiated cells in the suprabasal layers such as the corni ﬁed layer contain a higher composition of DSC1 and DSG1/4, which provided the strongest binding strength.This correlates with the need for differentiated keratinocytes to form strong and stable cell-cell adhesions to maintain a physicalbarrier that protects the epidermis from mechanical and chemical stresses ( Harrison et al., 2016 ;Green et al., 2019 ).
Taken together, studies on desmosomes have begun to shed some light in understanding its role along with other adhesion proteins in maintaining the proliferative capacity of stem cells inits niche. However, more studies are needed to fully understand its role in mechanical transduction and maintaining other stem cell niches.2.3.3 Tight junctions Tight junction (TJ) proteins are a branching network of intercellular adhesion complexes that controls the permeability of the tissue.TJs are present on epithelial and endothelial cells (Figure 1 ).In the epithelium, tight junction structures form partitions between the apical and the basolateral domains that prevent the intermixing of both t he transmembrane components, thereby supporting cell polarity.TJ proteins are categorized into two groups depending on their function ality: integral transmembrane protein and peripheral membrane proteins or plaque proteins.
Four transmembrane proteins namely cla udins, occludin, tricellulin and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) aids in forming tightly regulated networks between the peripheral membrane proteins. On the other hand, peripheral adapter proteins such as zona-occludens 1 (ZO-1), ZO-2 and ZO-3 play a role in connecting the transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and other signaling molecules ( Lee et al., 2018 ).Differences in expression of these TJ proteins play an important role in r egulating the barrier integrity of the membrane.Studies have shown that TJ proteins play an important role in controlling the biological functions of several stem cells.For example, occluding junctions have been shown to play a novel role in regulating the niche of the hematopoietic stem cells wheninduced with a bacterial infection ( Khadilkar et al., 2017 ).In Drosophila , an immune response is triggered upon infection that Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 10Lim et al.
10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 leads to barrier breaks due to modulations in the occluding junctions. This in turn helps in prohemocyte differentiation that eventually induced immune cell production, thereby activating the immune response.TJ proteins like occludins, ZO-1, caludinspresent in human NSCs (hNSCs) are known to help in the formation of hNSC clusters known as neurospheres.The formation of these neurospheres are critical for maintainingthe stemness of hNSCs.TJ proteins were downregulated upon induction of differentiation in NSCs, further corroborating the fact that they are important in maintaining the stemness of theNSCs ( Watters et al., 2015 ).This suggests a plausible connection between TJ protein levels and their regulation of the NSC niche.However, further studies are required to establish the directinteraction of NSCs and the TJ protein complex that might play a role in this cluster formation.
3 Implication of adhesion molecules in diseases Several diseases have been linked to changes in the expression or function of various adhesion molecules ( Table 1 ). 3.1 In ﬂammatory bowel disease One of the roles of the intestinal epithelium is to prevent the exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to foreign antigens and harmful microbiota.This is achieved by the formation of tightly regulated cell junctions and organization of the epithelium toestablish a barrier.This epithelial barrier integrity is maintained by the TJ proteins that consist of both transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins like occludin, zonula occludensand claudins that are linked to the cytoskeleton of the cell ( Landy et al., 2016 ;Chelakkot et al., 2018 ).Defects in maintaining this barrier function leads to pathological conditions likeinﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD).IBD is a chronic in ﬂammatory disease that causes severe inﬂammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
The disease is mainly categorized into two types depending on the part of the in ﬂamed intestine: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn ’s disease (CD) (Chelakkot et al., 2018 ;Binienda et al., 2020 ). The characteristic symptoms of IBD are a leaky gut that is caused by the apoptotic and ulcerative intestinal epithelium, resulting in severe in ﬂammation.Previous studies have shown that over- expression of a TJ protein claudin 2 in UC patients increased pore formation in their epithelium.On the other hand, claudins 3, 4 and 7 which help in tightening the epithelial junctions werefound to be reduced in these patients ( Prasad et al., 2005 ;Oshima et al., 2008 ).This suggested differential expression of several TJ proteins might be a major cause of increased permeability of theintestinal epithelium that leads to defective barrier function.Similarly, in CD, perturbed organization of the TJ proteinswas observed in in ﬂamed areas.
Several studies showed claudin 2 to also be upregulated in the CD patients with a concomitant downregulation of claudin 3,5,8 ( Kucharzik et al., 2001 ;Zeissig et al., 2007 ;Das et al., 2012 ). In addition to TJ proteins, AJ proteins have also been shown to be involved in a relapse of this disease.Downregulation of the E-cadherin-catenin complex led to the loss of cell-cell junctions in the gut thatexposed the luminal content to the immune cells thereby increasing the relapse of CD ( Wyatt et al., 1993 ;Arnott et al., 2000 ).Treatment options for IBD have substantially improved over the past few decades.Several drugs have been developed to target interleukins (ILs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as JAKsignaling that regulates several cytokines, for treating both the types of IBD.Even though there has been advancement in the drug discovery and delivery process, some patients still do notrespond to the drugs and display a relapse of the symptoms.
SC based therapy is a promising treatment option that has started to develop. Somatic SCs such as HSCs and MSCs have already beenused for treating IBD patients ( Shimizu et al., 2019 ).The HSC transplantation process requires rebooting the immune system by lymph ablation followed by reconstruction of the immune system.A pilot study based on autologous HSC transplantation showed regaining of responsiveness to the drugs as well assustained remission in about 80% of the patients suffering from refractory CD ( López-García et al., 2017 ).Even though there was an improvement after the transplantation, CD relapsedin most of the patients in a span of 5 years.In addition, severe adverse events occurred in many patients who received HSCT compared to the control group.Taken together, this studysuggested HSCT to be one of the methods that can be used for treating patients with severe CD but requires improvement compared to the conventional methods.
Mesenchymal stem cell therapy is another technique that has been used for treating active CD ﬁstula ( Misselwitz et al., 2020 ). MSCs have been reported to show immunosuppressive behavioras well as decreased the effect of the lymphocytes, thereby modulating the immune system ( Aggarwal and Pittenger, 2005 ;Corcione et al., 2006 ; Ren et al., 2008 ).Clinical studies have already been conducted using bone marrow derived MSC transplantation (MSCT) as well as adipose derived MSC transplantation (ASCT) ( Shimizu et al., 2019 ).In a phase 2 trial of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell transplantation, the Crohn ’s disease activity index (CDAI) was reduced in patients suffering from luminal CD ( Forbes et al., 2014 ).Almost 53% of the patients had clinical remission within 42 days of receiving the treatment.In this study, only one case of severe adverse effect was reported, which led to theoccurrence of stage 1 adenocarcinoma after 3 weeks of the treatment.
Even though MSCT seemed better than the HSCT, long term ef ﬁcacy of this treatment to maintain long-term disease remission needs further investigation. On the other hand, in a phase 3 randomized, double-blind study, ASCT was shown to be Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 11Lim et al.10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 an effective treatment for patients with complex perianal ﬁstula associated with Crohn ’s disease ( Panés et al., 2016 ).Among the 212 patients randomly divided into treatment and placebo groups, almost 50% of the ASCT treated patients attainedremission.Adverse effect cases that included anal abscess and proctalgia were almost similar in number for both the treated and placebo patients.This suggested both ASCT and MSCT to besafer treatment options for IBD patients who failed to respond to conventional treatments.In 2012, Yui et al.developed intestinal organoid models and transplanted intestinal stem cells (ISC) in mice with colitis ( Yui et al., 2012 ).
Based on this study, Ryuichi Okamoto ’s group is now using ISC transplantation (ISCT) to study this potentialtreatment method to cure patients with refractory IBD. ISCs have been isolated from patient derived biopsies that are now being tested for therapeutic potential ( Shimizu et al., 2019 ).These cells have the potential to proliferate and reestablish the wound bed in these patients, thereby protecting the organ from mechanical and pathogenic insults.This method is awaiting clinical trials but hasthe potential to directly cause mucosal healing.In addition to the stem cell-based treatments, given the importance of maintaining barrier function in IBD, identifying the mechanism of the cell- cell junctions regulation might aid in improving these therapeutics.
3.2 Epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare diseases caused by mutations in genes that encode for both ECM and focaladhesion proteins and is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 people worldwide ( Bruckner et al., 2020 ). It is characterized by fragile skin and severe blistering and lesions that can occur from as earlyas childbirth.The most common type of EB is Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS), and can be caused by autosomal recessive mutation of the desmoplakin gene in the suprabasal cells orautosomal dominant mutations in the keratin 5/14 genes in the basal cells.Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), which occurs due to an autosomal recessive mutation in an array of ECM andhemidesmosome proteins such as Laminin-332 and α6β4 and BP230 integrin along the basement membrane.Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB) occurs due to a mutation inCollagen VII, which is localized below the basement membrane ( Bruckner-Tuderman, 2019 ).
These molecular mutations impair the structure and functional integrity withinhighly specialized interfaces of the skin, that are important for cell adhesion, tissue repair and barrier function. Ultimately, this leads to a diminished resistance to mechanical stress andshearing forces, which causes subsequent cell and tissue damage ( Uitto and Richard, 2004 ;Fine et al., 2008 ;Bruckner- Tuderman et al., 2013 ).EB poses as a potentially life-threatening disease as the perpetual and progressive scarring triggered by skin blisteringand lesions leads to chronic wounds.These chronic wounds are coupled with increased bacterial colonization, ﬁbrosis, inﬂammation, and a systemic development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( Guerra et al., 2017 ).Mutations in the genes are not restricted to the skin but also in other epithelialized (gastrointestinal, urogenital tract, respiratory) or mesenchymal (skeletal muscle) organs ( Prodinger et al., 2019 ).
EB with Pyloric atresia in patients affects both the skin and digestive tract, causing severe blistering and also an obstruction of the pylorus ( Nakano et al., 2001 ). There are no direct cures for any of the EB subtypes, and current treatment strategies are only useful in managing the wounds and pain caused by EB.Numerous preclinical research and developments using genecorrection, protein replacement and cell-based treatments such as bone marrow transplantation and mesenchymal stem cell therapy have pointed to new therapeutic avenues and haveentered early clinical trials.Stem cells present a promising avenue to reverse some of the damage caused by Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) and early rese arch in animal models suggest that hematopoietic cell tra nsplantation (HCT) from WT donor-derived cells to RDEB mice improved its survival and skin strength ( Tolar et al., 2009 ).
These positive results spurred the development of a small clinic al trial involving allogeneic HCT in 6 children with RDEB. Overall, the trial showed promising results as 5 out of 6 of the patients displayed an increase in collagen VII deposi tion in the Dermal Epidermal Junction (DEJ), improved wounding healing and a decrease in blister formation ( Tolar and Wagner, 2013 ).Additional trials have been conducted with varying outcomes ( Petrof et al., 2015 ;Rashidghamat and McGrath, 2017 ).Current phase 2 clinical trials include furt her testing of healthy donor mesenchymal stem cell infusions into EB patients.Thesedevelopments are promising an d provide potentially better therapeutic treatments forEB.( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ show/NCT02582775 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01033552 ).Additionally, studies from other groups have successfully employed ex vivo cell and gene therapy to treat intermediate JEB caus ed by mutations in Laminin β 3.
In an initial study, epidermal stem cells from an adult patient affected by Laminin β3d eﬁcient JEB were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing Laminin β3c D N Ae n c o d i n g functional Laminin β3 and applied to the affected skin area as cohesive epidermal sheets made from a plastic substrate (Mavilio et al., 2006 ). The study proved to be ef ﬁcacious during a 6.5 years follow up, where the epidermis became fully functional and restored with no adverse reaction ( De Rosa et al., 2014 ).This positive response spurred further testing on a 7-year-old boy in 2015 with EB and epidermal loss in 80% of h i sb o d yu s i n gt h es a m eg e n et h e r a p yt op r o d u c ef u n c t i o n a l laminin 332 from transgenic cultured epidermis using a ﬁbrin substrate ( Hirsch et al., 2017 ).Similarly, the patient displayed good results after the treatment, with his newly formed Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org 12Lim et al.
10.3389/fcell.2022.966662 epidermis expressing normal levels of laminin 332, displaying a functional basement membrane that remained resistant to mechanical stress and blistering. In the long run, gene therapy to correct mutations causing EB might prove useful.Further scrutiny and hopes can be pinned onto these 2 patients as they continue to undergo observational studies to monitor the ef ﬁcacy of this treatment method ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/NCT05111600 ).3.3 Breast cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women globally.Annually, about 1.7 million new cases are recorded in the world ( Hai-Ying et al., 2020 ).The mammary gland is the milk- producing organ in animals, which continuously develops after birthand fully differentiates upon pregnancy and lactation.
During postnatal development and onset of reproductive cycles, the mammary gland is dynamically remodeled and undergoesmorphological changes due to changes in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. This inherent plasticity has been suggested to increase the susceptibility of the organ to carcinogenesis ( Paavolainen and Peuhu, 2021 ).Mechanical signals that cells receive from their surroundings are emerging as key players and contributors to tumor progression ( Humphrey et al., 2014 ;Panciera et al., 2017 ).These mechanical signals change with the composition of theECM during mammary development.Tumor progression of mammary cells can be characterized by increased ECM deposition, also known as desmoplasia.Collagen V isincreased in desmoplastic stroma in human breast carcinoma (Barsky et al., 1982 ).
Clinically, desmoplastic stroma is associated with a 4 –6 fold increased relative risk of developing breast carcinoma, with poor prognosis ( Boyd et al., 2001 ;Guo et al., 2001 ). Recent studies have begun to highlight the importance of external mechanical signals th at mammary gland cells receive in driving tumorigenesis.Initially, it was shown that primary luminal mammary gland cells we re able to form self-renewing colonies in the presence of oncogenic factors such as EGFR and activated HER2 ( Panciera et al., 2020 ).This led to the development of solid organoids composed entirely of K8+luminal cells which are a hallmark of human HER2+ breast cancer.However, when these cells were plated on a soft adhesive hydrogel of 0.5 kPa which phenocopies theexternal environment of the normal mammary gland, the presence of the same oncogenic factors were insuf ﬁcient to develop into self-renewing so lid organoids reminiscent in breast cancers.
However, wh en the primary luminal cells were plated on the hydrogels of higher rigidity (40 kPa), the growth of these organoids was observed.Mechanistically, this w as shown to be due to the mechanical cues conferred fro m a stiffer environment, thatultimately led to increased YA P/TAZ signaling and increased proliferation and self-renewal ( Panciera et al., 2020 ). YAP activation also causes remode ling of the surrounding ECM a n dt h i sf a v o r e dt u m o rs p r e a d i n g( Calvo et al., 2013 ).Other studies have also begun to highlight the role of various cell adhesion molecules in the development of breast cancer, such as the activation of intracellular FAK ( dos Santos et al., 2012 ; Provenzano and Keely, 2009 ).In particular, change to a stiffer ECM has been found to correlate with increased FAK activation and increase tumorigenesis in mammary cells.
Integrin αvβ3w a s also found to be signi ﬁcantly elevated in metastatic tumors compared to primary pancreatic and breast tumors. Mechanistically, this seemed to occur by the recruitment of Srckinase that promotes migration of the cancer cells ( Ghajar & Bissell, 2008 ;Desgrosellier et al., 2010 ).Studies from multiple groups have described potential therapeutic modalities such asintegrin β1 blocking antibodies, since tumors derived from human xenograft models and transgenic models displayed signi ﬁcant growth inhibition upon treatment with an integrin β1 inhibitory antibody ( White et al., 2004 ;Park et al., 2006 ).As the ECM is increasingly recognized as the master regulator of cell response and behavior, an increase in the knowledge and understanding of the dynamic role that ECM plays in cancer biology, both in terms of its architectural complexity and how thisaffects the tumor progression in breast cancer, will be valuable.
Biomimetic models such as the decellularized ECM recapitulates the complex ECM microenvironment of the mammary glands andcan be useful tools to allow a better understanding of cell-ECM interactions. Although these approaches to treating breast cancer are still new, it may shed light on the tumorigenesis of themammary gland cancer and open new treatment paradigms (Wishart et al., 2020 ;Tamayo-Angorrilla et al., 2021 ).4 Discussion, perspectives and future directions The connection between cells and ECM through FA and the cell to cell junction through AJ, both serve as mechanosensitive hubs.Inthis review, we have discussed how mechanotransduction through these hubs contribute to maintaining various stem cell niches.A d d i t i o n a l l y ,w eh a v ed i s c u s s e d upcoming stem cell-based therapeutics for several diseases which are associated with the adhesion molecules.

Beyond regenerative medicine, the implication of microenvironmen tal factors that regulates both mechanical and biochemical signaling to improve the diseaseoutcome remains largely unexplored and opens up an exciting domain of research.
