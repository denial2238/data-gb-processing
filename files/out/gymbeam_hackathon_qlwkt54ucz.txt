Data Availabilit yStatement: Third party datawas obtained forthisstudy from TheDHS Program (https://dhs program.com/) .Data mayberequested reported thefollowing contributions; primary level ofwomen’s education (7.2%), secondary andabove (17.8%), having ANC visitduring pregnancy (62.1%), delivery atahealth institu- tion(26.53%), living inthemetropolis (13.7%), central region (34.2%), child age18–23 months (4.7%) contributed totheobserved wealth related inequality intheconsumption of foods richinvitamin AinEthiopia. Conclusion Wefound pro-rich wealth-related inequality inVAC among children ofage6–23 months in Ethiopia.Additionally, maternal education, region, ANC visit, andplace ofdelivery were the significant contributors ofwealth-related inequality ofVAC.Nutritional related interventions should prioritise children from poorer households andlesseducated mothers.
Moreover, enhancing access toANC andhealth facilities delivery services through education, advo- cacy, andcampaign programs ishighly recommended inthestudy setting. Introduction Inadequate micro-nutrients feeding practices toinfants and young children, particularly inthe first 2years oflife,arethekeyrisk factors forunder-nutrition and delayed cognitive develop- ment and growth mainly indeveloping countries [1].Good VAconsumption refers tothe intake offoods rich inVAatleast onefood item among themain type offood items [2].The human body cannot produce VAand thus foods rich initaretheonly sources forthe human body demand ofvitamin A[2].However, ensuring that VAisavailable inadequate amount remains achallenge, mainly inresource-limited countries including Ethiopia.
Glob- ally, itisestimated that more than 124million children require access toVArich foods orsup- plementations [3].Inmost African countries, thedietary intake ofVitamin A-rich foods and other micronutrients isbelow thedaily-recommended amount [4–6]. InEthiopia, about 62% ofchildren aged 6–23 months hadpoor vitamin Afood intake [7].Inmost lowand middle- income countries including Ethiopia, there hasbeen disproportionately high burden ofvita- min Adeficiency (VAD) and limited consumption offoods rich inVAamong children inthe poorest segment ofthepopulation [7,8].VAD, acommon form ofmicronutrient deficiency [9],hasbeen magnified bypoverty sta- tusand higher prevalence ofinfectious diseases [10], and itistheunderlying cause ofmorbid- ityand mortality duetomeasles, diarrhea, and malaria among childeren ofage6–59 months inAfrican countries, including Ethiopia [3,4,11,12].Furthermore, VAD causes night blind- ness problem, Bitot’s spots and other morbid conditions [13].
The high rate ofVAD ispartly duetopoor consumption offoods rich inVA[14]. Some literatures noted theexistence ofsocio-economic related inequalities inaccess to micronutrients and thecontributing factors totheinequality among children inlowresource countries [15–18].The concentration index and theWagstaff decomposition analyses arethe appropriate statistical approaches toestimate theextent ofinequality ofaparticular health out- come and identify thepossible contributing factors fortheobserved inequality ofthat outcome [19].
Accordingly, women’s level ofeducation, income, age, marital status, occupation, place ofresidence, useofprenatal and antenatal care, child age, sex,current breast-feeding status, birth order, and number ofunder fivechildren inthefamily aresome ofthekeycontributors tothesocio-economic related inequalities toaccess toVAC inparticular and micro-nutrients PLOS ONEInequal itiesinvitamin Arichfood consump tion PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03023 68October 8,2024 2/16from TheDHS Program after creating anaccoun t andsubmitting aconcept note.

Notably, Vitamin ASupplementation isaneffective strategy that shown remarkable reduction inthemorbidity and mortality related tovitamin Adeficiency disorders indifferent countries [24, 25]. However, itdoes notsustainably improve thevitamin Astatus ofapopulation forithelps only toattain minimally adequate vitamin Astores during thefirst 2years oflife[23].Thus, itisimperative toconsider dietary modifications that leads to theconsumption ofvitamin A-rich foods asthemost appropriate measure tocontrol thebur- den ofVAD [26].Although literatures areavailable regarding thedeterminants ofconsumptions offoods rich invitamin A[14, 27–30], wecouldn’t locate, tothebest ofoursearch, astudy that assessed wealth related inequality and contributors ofvitamin Aconsumption among children inEthi- opia.The findings ofthisstudy may inform theformulation ofpolicies and actions and would help toprioritise targeted interventions toreduce theexisting wealth related inequalities of VAC inEthiopia.
Therefore, thepresent study assessed thewealth related inequality inVAC and decompose ittothevarious socio-demographic and economic, maternal health care utilization, and child characteristics that may contribute totheoverall inequality inVAC inEthiopia. Method Data sources and populations The present study wasconducted using the2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey (EMDHS) dataset.Itisthefifth DHS implemented inEthiopia from March 21,2019 to June 28,2019.The 2019 EMDHS wasconducted bytheCentral Statistical Agency inpartner- ship with theFederal Ministry ofHealth and theEthiopian Public Health Institute.The sample used forthesurvey wasstratified and selected using twostages.Firstly, atotal of 305EAs (93inurban, 212inrural) were chosen independently with aprobability proportional toeach EAs.Second, from thenewly formed household listing, afixed number of30house- holds/clusters were selected with anequal probability ofsystematic selection.
The detailed sampling procedures areavailable onthemeasure DHS website inthe2019 EMDHS report accessible on(https://www.dhsprogram. com).Third party data wasobtained forthisstudy from The DHS Program (https://dhsprogram.c om/).Data may berequested from The DHS Program after creating anaccount and submitting aconcept note.More access information canbefound onThe DHS Program website (https://dhsprogram.com/data/Acce ss- Instructions.cfm).The data setisopenly available upon permission from theMEASURE DHS website (https://www.dhsp rogram.com/data/available-datase ts.cfm).The authors confirm that interested researchers would beable toaccess these data inthesame manner astheauthors.The authors also confirm that they hadnospecial access privileges that others would nothave The kids record (KR) data setwasused toinclude atotal weighted sample of1,497 infants and young children ofage6–23 months inthecurrent study.Variables ofthestudy Outcome variable.

These questions were asked tothemothers’ orthe caregivers’ oftheinfants anytime inthelast24hours preceding thesurvey. Contributing variables totheinequality invitamin Aconsumption The contributing factors ofVAC include women’s level ofeducation, age, marital status, occu- pation, place ofresidence, region, useofprenatal and antenatal care, child age, sex,current breast feeding status, birth order, and number ofunder fivechildren inthefamily, family size, and household wealth index, were some ofthekeycontributors tothesocio-economicrelated inequalities toconsumption offoods rich invitamin A(Table 1).Operational definations.The following varibles used inthepresent study were defined and categorized operationally based ontheprevious similar evidences available [32–34] and theDHS guideline [35].Distance tohealth facility.

Breast feeding status.This hasbeen assessed byasking themothers and recoreded as “yes” ifthey were breast fedtheir infant/child during thesurvey period and “no” otherwise [36].Data management and analysis Data extraction, editing, coding, and cleaning were performed using STATA 14software.The data wasweighted using sampling weight (v005) torestore thesurvey’s representativeness and obtain valid statistical estimates.The wealth related inequalities inVAC were quantified using concentration index (C)and depicted using concentration curves (CC).The concentration curve isobtained byplotting thecumulative proportion oftheoutcome variable (VAC) ony- axis against theincreasing percentage ofthepopulation ranked bythehousehold wealth index (poorest torichest) onx-axis.
Ifthecurve isabove thelineofequality (45degree line) that means theindex value isnegative hence itshows that theoutcome variable isdisproportionally concentrated among thepoor and vice-versa.

Decomposition oftheconcentration index (C) Toassess therelative contributions ofeach factor toinequalities inVAC, wedecomposed the concentration index ofVAC into itscontributory factors using theWagstaff approach [38]. Using thismethod ofdecomposition, wefirst calculated theconcentration index ofVAC and then each ofthecontributors totheconcentration index.Second, wecalculated theabso- lutecontribution ofeach factor (x)totheconcentration index ofVAC (y).The concentration index could bedecomposed into thecontributions ofeach factor tothewealth-related inequal- ities [39].
Foranylinear regression model onahealth outcome (y),such as; y¼/þX kbkxkþ ε ð1Þ The concentration index foryisthen written as; C¼X kbkXk=mÞCkþGCε=m ð Þ ð2Þ Whereμisthemean ofy,Xkisthemean ofxk,Ckistheconcentration index forxk,andGC εis thegeneralized concentration index fortheerror term ε.Eq(2)shows thatCisequal toa weighted sum oftheconcentration indices ofthekregressor, where theweight forxkisthe elasticity ofywith respect toxk.The residual component captured bytheerror term reflects thewealth-related inequality inhealth that isnotexplained bysystematic variation inthe regressor bywealth, which should approach zero forawell-specified model. Each contribution istheproduct ofelasticity with thedegree ofeconomic inequality.Moreover, thepercentage contribution isobtained bydividing each absolute contribution bytotal absolute contribution multiplied by100toobtain theestimates [40].
The decomposition analyses oftheconcentration index showed therelative contribution of each variable totheinequalities inVAC, asshown inTable 2.The table presents theconcentra- tion index foreach ofthevariables, theelasticity, theabsolute contribution aswell astheper- centage contribution ofeach variable totheinequalities inVAC. The negative sign intheC indicates themore concentration ofVAC among thepoor, where apositive value indicates concentration among therich.The elasticity indicates thesensitivity ofVAC foreach ofthe contributing factors.Absolute contribution iscalculated bymultiplying elasticity with theCof each factor and indicates theextent ofinequality contributed bytheexplanatory variables.Whereas, percent contribution refers tothecontribution ofeach variable totheoverall con- centration index.Ethical consideration Allmethods were carried outfollowing relevant guidelines oftheDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program.

With regard toeducational status, only (29.17%) children born from mothers with no education were able toconsumed foods rich inVA.About one-fifth (19.51%) ofthechildren born from women lived inthepoorest wealth quintile household hadgood consumption of foods rich inVA.Alternatively, above half(52.93%) ofthechildren lived with women from the household labelled astherichest wealth quintile hadgood consumption ofVA(Table 1).Consumptions offoods rich invitamin A Among theseven vitamin Arich food items, themost commonly consumed item wasegg, 269 (17.97%), and theleast item consumed bythechildren wasfishand shellfish foods, 29(1.94%) [Fig 1].
Wealth related inequality ofVAC The value oftheCisranged from -1to1.Anegative sign indicates themore concentration of consumption offoods rich invitamin Aamong thepoor, whereas apositive value indicates concentration among therich. Inourstudy, theoverall Wagstaff normalized concentration index analyses ofthewealth-related inequality ofVAC was[C=0.25; 95% C:0.15, 0.35].The result showed that VAC among children aged 6–23 months wasdisproportionately concen- trated onthericher groups which implied apro-rich distribution ofVAC.The concentration curve liesbelow the45-degree diagonal line(line ofequality) that indicates ahigher level of consumption ofVArich foods concentrated among children from therich socio-economicsta- tus(Fig 2).Wealth related inequality ofVAC plotted bykeyvariables The concentration curve hasfurther been used toshow theinequality inVAC among children between oramong categories ofkeyvariables inourstudy.

Decomposition ofwealth-related inequality inVAC Wedecomposed theVAC concentration index against thesocio-demographic, socio-eco- nomic, and maternal and child related variables toshow therelative contribution ofeach vari- able toinequalities inVAC. Accordingly, theoverall concentration index [0.25 (95% C:0.15, 0.35; p=0.01)] ofVAC wasfurther decomposed and explained byeach explanatory variables asfollows; more than one-fourth (28.9%) oftheobserved wealth related inequality intheconsumption ofvitamin A rich foods among children age6–23 months wasexplained bythesocio-demographic factors.The women’s educational status; primary education (7.2%), secondary and above (17.8%), and thenumber ofunder fivechildren inthehousehold; onechild (12.5%), twoand above (-9.7%) were thesocio-demographic significant contributors tothewealth related inequality toVAC.
Additionally, having ANC visit during pregnancy and delivery atahealth institution contrib- uted about 62.1%, and 26.53% totheinequality inVAC, respectively. Bygeography, while liv- inginthemetropolis explained 13.7% totheinequality, central region contributed about 34.2% tothesame.Lastly, ageofthechildren (18–23 months) explained 4.7% totheobserved wealth related inequality intheconsumption offoods rich invitamin AinEthiopia (Table 2).Fig2.Concentrat ioncurve showin gthewealth related inequality inconsumpt ionoffoods rich invitamin A among children aged 6–23 months inEthiopia.https://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0302368.g0 02 PLOS ONEInequal itiesinvitamin Arichfood consump tion PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03023 68October 8,2024 9/16 Discussion Inourstudy, theoverall Wagstaff normalized concentration index analyses ofthewealth- related inequality inconsumption offoods rich invitamin A(VAC, hereafter) was[C=0.25; 95% C:0.15, 0.35].
The result showed that VAC among children aged 6–23 months wasdis- proportionately concentrated onthericher groups (pro-rich distribution), disfavouring the poor. Although directly notrelated, there have been some studies conducted onthesocio-eco- nomic related inequality onminimum acceptable diet and recommended micronutrient intake among children ofage6–59 months ingeneral [17, 18,41,42].The findings ofthe aforementioned studies supported ourstudy inthat access toand consumption offoods rich inthemicro-nutrients wasdiscriminately concentrated intherich households.The above wealth-health association could beexplained inthat women from higher-income households could have accessed and were more likely toafford tohave diversified foods including fruits and vegetables rich invitamin A[43, 44].Asaresult, children from such fami- liesmight have good consumption ofvitamin Arich foods compared tothose children from a lowhousehold income [45].
Wealso found that theproportion ofchildren who hadgood consumption offoods rich in vitamin Awasdiscriminately concentrated among children born tomothers; with higher edu- cational attainment, who hadANC visits during pregnancy, and who delivered atahealth Fig3.Wealth related inequality toVAC among children attributable towomen ’seducation alstatus. https://doi.org/10 .1371/journal.p one.0302368.g003 PLOS ONEInequal itiesinvitamin Arichfood consump tion PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03023 68October 8,2024 10/16 institution.The geographic region and child’s agewere also contributed tothepro-wealth related inequalities inVAC.Assuch, maternal education wasoneofthekeycontributors tothewealth related inequality inVAC where primary education contributed about 7.2% and secondary and above 17.8% to theoverall concentration index.
Although there hasbeen nostudy assessing thecontribution ofmaternal education tothewealth inequalities inVAC, several studies have highlighted the contribution ofthisfactor inexplaining thedisparities invitamin Asupplementation, mini- mum dietary diversity and micro-nutrient intake among children [17, 18,21]. The link between women education with good vitamin Aconsumption could beduetohigher dietary knowledge [29, 44], better health literacy, dietary information-seeking behaviour, understand- ing, and critical thinking skills related tonutritional information ofthewomen [46].The other possible justification could berelated tothestrong link among education-occupat ion/income- nutrition [47–50] inwhich women with higher educational attainment would have better income opportunity and thus better secure thenutritional demand oftheir children.
Inthisstudy, wefound that maternal health care utilization including theANC visit and delivery athealth facilities hadmade significant positive contribution tothewealth related inequality intheconsumption offoods rich invitamin A.This finding wassupported with the previous studies conducted inIndonesia [21] and Ghana [42, 51]. Fig4.Wealth related inequa litytoVAC among childr enwhose mothers had ANC follow-u pduring pregnan cy.https://d oi.org/10.1371 /journal.pone.0302368.g004 PLOS ONEInequal itiesinvitamin Arichfood consump tion PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03023 68October 8,2024 11/16 This could beexplained inthat thecounselling and nutrition information that thewomen received from thehealth professionals during theANC visits would increase their health liter- acyand thereby help tofeed their children with therecommended dietary mix including the micro-nutrients [52].
Inthis study, higher agecategory (18–23 months) ofthechild had positively contributed tothepro-rich inequality inVAC. This finding was inagreement with the fewliteratures elsewhere [17, 53].This correlation could beexplained bythefact that there hasbeen anincrease inthepractice ofweaning atlater ageofthechild inmost women [54, 55].Finally, ourfinding noted that living inthemetropolis and central region ofthecountry haspositively contributed totheoverall inequality toVAC and ofcourse inaccordance with previous studies [18, 41].The possible explanation isthat children insuch locations (mostly urban) belongs tobetter socio-economic status and thus hadahigher likelihood foraccess to foods rich inVAcompared tothose children living intheperiphery [18, 56].
Strength and limitation ofthestudy Weperformed Wagstaff decomposition analysis using themost recent national survey data that enables enhanced understanding onthevarious factors contributing tothewealth-related inequality inconsumption offoods rich inVAC among children ofage6–23 months. How- ever, VAC isconstructed based onthesingle 24-hour food recall during thesurvey, thus may notreflect theactual feeding patterns.Besides, some variables such asfrequency oflistening radio and watching television were notrecorded inthemini EDHS 2019 which areimportant contributors ofwealth related inequalities inVAC.Conclusion The present study revealed aconsiderable wealth-related inequality intheVAC proportion among children ofage6–23 months inEthiopia.Additionally, itwasfound that maternal edu- cation, ANC visit, place ofdelivery, and region contributed most towards explaining wealth- related inequality toVAC.
The finding calls fortheneed tomulti-sectorial approaches toaddress theunderlying con- tributing factors totheinequality inVAC identified inthisstudy. Intervention strategies should prioritise addressing thesignificant modifiable factors identified inthisstudy.For instance, efforts toenhance access toANC and health institutions delivery services ishighly recommended fordelivering health-facility-based nutrition education and interventions inthe study setting.Supporting information S1Checklist.STROBE checklist ofitems forobservational study used toassess thequality ofour study reports.(DOCX) Acknowledgmen ts The authors would liketothank measure DHS fortheir permission toaccess thedatasets.
