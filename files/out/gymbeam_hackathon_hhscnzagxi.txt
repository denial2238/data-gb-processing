Hence, we aimed to elucidate the association between admission serum magnesium levels and AKI incidence in intensive care unit (ICU)- admitted cirrhotic patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using MIMIC-IV2.2 data, focusing on critically ill patients with cirrhosis.We employed univariable and multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses to robustly address our research objectives.To further substantiate the findings, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.Results: Among the 3,228 enrolled ICU-admitted cirrhotic patients, 34.4% were female, and the overall AKI incidence was 68.6% (2,213/3,228).Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed an independent relationship between elevated serum magnesium levels and increased AKI risk (OR = 1.55 [95% CI = 1.15–2.09], p = 0.004).
Compared with individuals with serum magnesium levels < 1.6 mg/dL, individuals with serum magnesium levels in Q2 (1.6–2.6 mg/dL) and Q3 (≥2.6 mg/dL) had adjusted ORs for AKI of 1.89 (95% CI = 1.34–2.65, p < 0.001) and 2.19 (95% CI = 1.27–3.75, p = 0.005), respectively. The restricted cubic spline analysis revealed that AKI risk increased linearly with increasing serum magnesium levels.Subgroup analysis revealed that the association between serum magnesium levels and AKI incidence was remarkably stable in subgroup analysis (all Pinteraction >0.05).Conclusions: High serum magnesium concentrations were significantly associated with an increased AKI risk in ICU-admitted patients with cirrhosis.Further randomized trials are needed to confirm this association.Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent complication in patients with cirrhosis, affecting up to 50% of hospitalized individuals with cirrhosis and 58% of such patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) [ 1–5].
AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, resulting in a very unfavorable prog - nosis and an increased likelihood of developing chronic kid - ney disease (CKD) following liver transplantation [ 3,5–7]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of AKI and its associated risk factors may contribute to the prevention and management of AKI, thereby enhancing the prognosis and quality of life of patients with cirrhosis.Magnesium ranks as the fourth most abundant cation in the body and plays a pivotal role in a multitude of physio - logical and biochemical processes, including enzyme activa - tion, nucleic acid stability, and protein synthesis [ 8–10 ].It also plays a role in regulating nerve and cardiac function, supporting mitochondrial function, and maintaining cytoskel - etal integrity [ 11–13 ].
Additionally, it acts as a catalyst for more than 300 intracellular reactions, including neurotrans - mitter release, energy generation and intracellular calcium regulation [ 8,14]. Dysmagnesemia not only interferes with various physiological activities but also results in the progres - sion of diseases, including renal dysfunction.Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that serum magnesium © 2024 The a uthor(s).

LIN ET AL.abnormalities are associated with the risk of developing AKI in different patient populations [ 10,15–17 ].However, the rela - tionship between serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI in critically ill cirrhotic patients admit - ted to the ICU remains controversial and poorly understood.Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify the association between serum magnesium levels at admis - sion and the risk of developing AKI in critically ill cirrhotic patients admitted to the ICU.
Materials and methods Data sources In the present retrospective cohort study, we used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV, ver - sion 2.2) database, a substantial, publicly accessible reposi - tory encompassing deidentified health-related data from patients admitted to critical care units at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019 [ 18,19]. Bingwen Lin, as one of the authors, obtained authorization to access the database (Record ID: 51729969).The review boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center granted approval for the use of the MIMIC-IV database.As the data were ano - nymized, written informed consent was waived, and we con - formed to the guidelines outlined in the ‘Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology’ [ 20] for observational research.
Study participants A total of 5871 patients who were diagnosed with liver cir - rhosis during their initial ICU admission were included in the study. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on the ninth and tenth versions of the International Classification of Diseases.Patients who were not admitted to the ICU and/or who were less than 18 years of age were subsequently excluded.Additionally, participants without serum magne - sium data on their first day of admission and with an ICU stay of less than 24 h were excluded.Ultimately, 3228 patients were included in this study.The patients were categorized into three groups based on their serum magnesium levels at ICU admission ( Figure 1 ).Data collection Structured Query Language was used to extract baseline characteristics, including age, sex, ethnicity, vital signs, lab - oratory results, comorbidities and disease severity score.
The data were collected within 24 h of admission to the ICU and included the use of ventilators, renal replacement ther - apy (RRT), vasoactive drugs, and loop diuretics, as well as the length of ICU and hospital stay. The use of diuretics, vasoactive agents and magnesium supplements was defined as receiving any loop diuretic, vasoactive agent or magne - sium supplement within 7 days after ICU admission, respec - tively.Additionally, the use of ventilators and undergoing RRT were recorded if they occurred within 24 h after ICU admission.Exposure The primary exposure variable of the current analysis was the total serum magnesium level, which was assessed as a continuous variable and was also classified into hypoMg (<1.6 mg/dL), normalMg (1.6–2.6 mg/dL) and hyperMg (>2.6 mg/dL)categories based on the admission value in the MIMIC-IV database.Serum magnesium concentrations were defined as the first measured value within 24 h after admis - sion to the ICU.Figure 1.
The flow chart of participants. RENAL FAILURE 3 Variable definitions and outcomes The incidence of AKI within 7 days after admission was the main outcome of this study.AKI identification and classifica - tion followed the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, defining the condition as fol - lows: an sCr increase of ≥0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) within 48 h, sCr elevation to ≥1.5 times baseline in the past 7 days and that is known or presumed to have occurred within the pre - vious 7 days, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 6-h period [ 1,21].If baseline sCr was not documented before ICU entry, the first recorded sCr postadmission was used as the baseline reference.Statistical analysis The baseline characteristics of the participants were pre - sented based on the different tertiles of serum magnesium levels.
Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as the mean ± SD, while skewed continuous vari - ables are described as the median (interquartile range [IQR]). Categorical variables are presented as frequencies (%).Comparisons of continuous variables among groups were conducted using the independent-samples Student’s t test or Mann–Whitney U test, depending on the normality of the distribution.Categorical data were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.For all analyses, as the percentages of missing data varied from 0.03 to 33.4%, we simply replaced the missing values with the mean or median value for continuous variables and set 9 as the cutoff for categorical variables.We employed multivariable logistic regression models to assess the independent association between serum magne - sium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI, adjusting for major covariates.
The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for this analysis. Serum magnesium concentrations were evaluated as both a categorical and continuous variable.The selection of confounders was based on judgment, previous scientific literature, significant covari - ates in the univariate analysis, their associations with the out - comes of interest, or a change in effect estimate of more than 10%.We constructed four models: (1) Model 1 was unadjusted; (2) Model 2 was adjusted for sex, age, race, MAP , white blood cell count, and calcium, potassium and glucose concentra - tions; (3) Model 3 was additionally adjusted for CKD, liver disease, Charlson’s Comorbidity Index, SOFA score, SAPS II and MELD-Na score; and (4) Model 4 was additionally adjusted for RRT status, ventilation status, diuretic use, vaso - active drug use and magnesium supplementation status.
To investigate the potential linear relationship between serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI, we used restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression with 4 knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles of serum magnesium after adjusting for variables in Model 4. To assess the consistency of the serum magnesium-AKI association across different patient profiles, we conducted subgroup analyses via stratified logistic regressions.These analyses were categorized by sex, age, MELD-Na score, CKD presence, sepsis, vasoactive agent use, and magnesium supplementa - tion.Interaction effects between subgroups were statistically evaluated using likelihood ratio tests, ensuring a robust examination of the relationship’s stability across various clin - ical contexts.We conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings.
First, considering the severe renal impairment of CKD individuals, which might introduce con - founding effects when examining the association between serum magnesium levels and the risk of developing AKI, we reevaluated the association between serum magnesium con - centrations and the risk of developing AKI by excluding patients with CKD, including those on chronic dialysis. Second, we performed additional analyses using only the serum creatinine level to categorize AKI, considering that changes in urine output are less frequently used for AKI diagnosis.Third, we employed multiple imputation instead of simple substitution to address missing values and reduce bias introduced by missing data.Finally, to mitigate the effects of hypoproteinemia, we corrected magnesium levels using the initial albumin concentration and assessed the association between corrected magnesium levels and the risk of developing AKI [ 22].
All analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (Version 4.2.2, http://www.R-project.org , The R Foundation) and the Free Statistics analysis platform (Version 1.9, Beijing, China, http://www.clinicalscientists.cn/freestatistics ). A two-sided p value <0.05 was considered to indicate sta - tistical significance.Results Baseline characteristics After strict screening according to the inclusion and exclu - sion criteria, a total of 3228 patients with cirrhosis who were admitted to the ICU were deemed eligible for this study.The overall prevalence of AKI was 68.6%.The baseline characteristics of the study cohorts categorized by serum magnesium levels are outlined in Table 1 .The overall mean age was 60.1 ± 12.3 years, and 1111 (34.4%) patients were female.
Patients with higher serum magnesium levels exhib - ited a greater propensity for increased age, white blood cell count, calcium concentrations, potassium concentrations, serum creatinine concentrations, urea nitrogen concentra - tions, total bilirubin concentrations, INR, and APTT than did those in the lower serum magnesium group. Moreover, they also demonstrated a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, CKD, hepatorenal syndrome, ascites and liver disease.Furthermore, there was a discernible ascending pattern from the lowest to the highest categories of serum magnesium levels for SAPSII, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the SOFA score, and the MELD-Na score.Additionally, the use of RRT and vasoactive agents was more prevalent in the highest serum magnesium group.4 B.LIN ET AL.Univariable logistic regression analysis of the incidence rate of AKI Serum magnesium concentrations were associated with the risk of developing AKI ( Table 2 ).
Additionally, univariable analysis demonstrated that age, heart rate, respiratory rate, MAP , SPO2, white blood cells, potassium, total bilirubin, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, ALT, AST, INR, APTT, conges - tive heart failure, CKD, hepatorenal syndrome, liver disease, sepsis, CCI, SAPSII, SOFA score, MELD-Na score, diuretic, RRT, vasoactive agent and ventilator use were associated with the risk of developing AKI in patients with cirrhosis ( p < 0.05).Table 1.

RENAL FAILURE 5 Multivariable logistic regression analysis of the association between serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI After adjusting for potential confounding variables in the sample-weighted multivariable analyses ( Table 3 ), a positive association was observed between the serum magnesium concentration and the risk of developing AKI, regardless of whether serum magnesium concentrations were analyzed as a continuous variable or categorical variable. As a continuous variable, higher serum magnesium concentrations were asso - ciated with an increased risk of developing AKI (unadjusted OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.49–4.05; p < 0.001; Table 3 ).According to the multivariable logistic regression model, this relationship remained significant, as a 1 mg/dL increase in the serum magnesium concentration was associated with a 55% greater risk of developing AKI (adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.15–2.09; p = 0.004; Table 3 , Model 4).
When considered a categorical variable, there was a clear upward trend toward a greater incidence of AKI among patients with increasing serum mag - nesium concentration tertiles ( p for trend = 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis revealed that the odds ratios (95% CIs) for the risk of developing AKI were 1.89 (95% CI = 1.34–2.65; p < 0.001) for Q2 and 2.19 (95% CI = 1.27–3.75; p = 0.005) for Q3 of serum magnesium concen - trations (Q1 as the reference; Table 3 , Model 4).RCS regression model Using a RCS model, we showed that the risk of developing AKI increased linearly with increasing serum magnesium lev - els ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).Subgroup, sensitivity and additional analyses Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robust - ness of our main findings regarding the association between serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI.

Discussion In this large population-based cohort study, we consistently observed a significant positive association between serum magnesium levels and the risk of developing AKI in a multivariable logistic regression analysis after adjustment for confounders. Similar patterns of association were observed for subsequent subgroup analysis.The relationship between high serum magnesium concen - trations and the risk of developing AKI has been a subject of discussion in the preceding academic literature.In a multi - center retrospective cohort investigation involving 6,124 adult patients subjected to cardiac surgery, higher early postopera - tive serum magnesium levels were shown to correlate with a heightened risk of postoperative AKI [ 23].
However, in pairs, another retrospective observational study delved into a cohort of 1,685 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, revealing that patients exhibiting hypermagnesemia experienced a significantly greater prevalence of AKI (65 Figure 2. Subgroup analysis for the associations between serum magnesium concentrations and acute kidney injury.each stratification adjusted for all confounders (Table 3 , Model 4), except for the stratification factor itself.RENAL FAILURE 7 versus 50%; p < 0.001) and AKI necessitating continuous RRT (CRRT) (18 versus 5%; p < 0.001) relative to their nonhyperma - gnesemic counterparts [ 24].Additionally, a retrospective obser - vational study encompassing 3,669 critically ill children suggested a significant association between hypermagnesemia and increased AKI (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.27–1.82, p < 0.001) [25].Even so, studies on patients with cirrhosis are limited.
In our current study, we observed that higher serum magnesium concentrations were associated with a significantly greater risk of developing AKI in patients with cirrhosis, which was consis - tent with previous studies. In contrast, several alternative investigations with diverse sample populations have produced contrasting outcomes.For instance, a prospective cohort study conducted in three ICUs in Brazil, which included 7,042 critically ill patients, revealed that hypomagnesemia, but not hypermagnesemia, at ICU admission was associated with the risk of developing AKI (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.08–1.46) [ 12].Similarly, hypomag - nesemia, but not hypermagnesemia, was associated with the risk of developing AKI in other kinds of patients, including those with acute pancreatitis, traumatic brain injury, or malig - nancy [ 10,26,27].
Interestingly, one study with a large sample size verified that both hypermagnesemia and hypomagnese - mia could increase the risk of developing AKI in hospitalized patients in the general population [ 14]. We hypothesize that the inconsistency across the findings of these studies might partly stem from variations in study demographics, sample sizes, and the consideration or lack thereof of potentially confounding variables such as patient heterogeneity, necessi - tating further research to validate these assumptions.In our research, we focused on individuals afflicted with cirrhosis, a condition predisposing them to a greater likeli - hood of developing electrolyte imbalances, which are typi - cally characterized by reduced serum magnesium levels (i.e., hypomagnesemia).This decline can arise due to dimin - ished magnesium intake, compromised fat absorption, the use of diuretics, renal tubular acidosis, and elevated serum concentrations of growth hormone and glucagon [ 28,29].
Nonetheless, in our present study cohort, elevated serum magnesium levels were prevalent, and we indeed observed a corresponding increase in the incidence of AKI concurrent with heightened serum magnesium concentrations. The definitive mechanism linking hypermagnesemia to an increased risk of developing AKI remains unclear.However, magnesium plays a pivotal role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, serving to mitigate vasoconstriction induced by endogenous catecholamines and augmenting the efficacy of naturally occurring vasodilatory agents [ 30–32 ].Abnormally high serum magnesium levels could plausibly disrupt renal hemodynamics and function and may lead to an imbalance in vascular tone homeostasis, culminating in an increased risk of developing AKI through overstimulated vasoconstric - tion and vasodilation responses [ 14].
Nonetheless, additional scientific inquiry is essential to fully expound upon the com - plex pathophysiological processes implicated in the relation - ship between serum magnesium levels and the occurrence of AKI. Further mechanistic studies, including animal models and controlled clinical trials, are crucial to decipher the exact pathways by which hypermagnesemia might contribute to AKI development.Considering patients afflicted with acute liver failure or acute-on-chronic liver failure, particularly those presenting with concurrent hypermagnesemia, the incorporation of novel extracorporeal detoxification therapies, such as the Coupled Plasma Filtration and Adsorption (CPFA) system [ 33] or the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) [ 34], may prove beneficial for hepatotoxin elimination and amelio - ration of hypermagnesemia, potentially preventing the devel - opment of AKI.Our study had several strengths.
First, it incorporated a relatively large, population-based cohort, providing ample statistical power to investigate the relationship between serum magnesium levels and the risk of developing AKI. Second, we conducted several sensitivity analyses to bol - ster the robustness of our findings.(1) By excluding partic - ipants with preexisting CKD, which could bias our results, we confirmed that the association between serum magne - sium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI risk remained stable.(2) Our cohort study revealed an AKI inci - dence rate of 68.6%, a notably high figure possibly stem - ming from the combined application of both serum creatinine and urine output criteria for diagnosing AKI.According to a supplementary sensitivity analysis in which AKI was solely diagnosed based on serum creatinine levels, the incidence decreased significantly to 40.3%, which is consistent with prior literature [ 3,5].
Despite this adjust - ment, the results consistently supported our initial find - ings. (3) To minimize potential biases due to missing data, we employed an alternative method of managing missing values, and the results were consistent with our primary conclusions.(4) Considering that hypoproteinemia is prev - alent among critically ill patients with cirrhosis, we further validated our results using albumin-calibrated serum mag - nesium measurements, ensuring that the impact of low protein levels on magnesium readings did not distort our findings.The results held strong even after this adjustment.Third, the findings have good potential for real-world applications.The current study, therefore, offers robust empirical evidence on the relationship between serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of developing AKI in patients with cirrhosis, taking meticulous account of potential confounding factors and biases.
Hence, these results imply that monitoring serum magnesium levels may be a useful tool for identifying individuals at greater risk of developing AKI. Finally, our study demonstrated that the strength and consistency of the significant associations between serum magnesium levels and the incidence of AKI were noteworthy, persisting across various subgroups stratified by age, sex, MELD-Na score, the presence of CKD, sepsis, the use of vasoactive agents, and magnesium supplementation.Nevertheless, several limitations merit consideration.First, as a retrospective study, our investigation is inherently lim - ited in establishing causal relationships.Therefore, while we 8 B.LIN ET AL.observed an association between serum magnesium levels and the risk of developing AKI, we cannot conclusively deter - mine the direction of this relationship, including the possibil - ity of reverse causality, where developing AKI might influence serum magnesium concentrations.
Second, categorizing AKI into three main subdivisions based on its direct etiology—(a) prerenal or functional AKI resulting from a reduction in effec - tive circulating volume, (b) AKI attributed to organic causes within the kidney, and (c) obstructive AKI due to urinary tract obstruction—facilitates a deeper understanding of its patho - genic mechanisms and enables more targeted guidance for clinical management and treatment. However, data about the causes of AKI and the parameters of circulating volume or renal blood flow were limited in the MIMIC-IV database.We suggest that future research incorporate these additional clinical variables to further elucidate the multifactorial nature of AKI, especially in the context of hypermagnesemia.
Third, the findings are based on a dataset derived from adult patients in the United States within a single ICU; hence, gen - eralizability to other populations worldwide necessitates cor - roborating evidence from future multicenter, prospective studies. Last, despite making adjustments for numerous potential confounders through maximizing sample size, unmeasured or residual confounders may still be present, inherent to retrospective designs.Notwithstanding these lim - itations, our data offer a substantial exploration of the asso - ciation between serum magnesium levels and the risk of developing AKI, contributing valuable insights to the existing body of knowledge.Conclusion In patients with cirrhosis admitted to the ICU, the occurrence of AKI increased with increasing serum magnesium.Therefore, the measurement of serum magnesium concentrations may be helpful for risk stratification and early prediction of AKI in ICU cirrhotic patients.
Further investigations are warranted to validate our findings and explore the detailed relationships and potential underlying mechanisms involved.
