Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of low-molecular-weight ﬁsh collagen (valine-glycine-proline-hydroxyproline-glycine-proline-alanine-glycine; LMWCP) on H 2O2- or LPS-treated primary chondrocytes and monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis rat models. Our ﬁndings indicated that LMWCP treatment exhibited protective effects by preventing chondrocyte death and reducing matrix degradation in both H 2O2-treated primary chondrocytes and cartilage tissue from MIA-induced osteoarthritis rats.This was achieved by increasing the levels of aggrecan, collagen type I, collagen type II, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3, while simultaneously decreasing catabolic factors such as phosphorylation of Smad, MMP-3, and MMP-13.Additionally, LMWCP treatment effectively suppressed the activation of inﬂammation and apoptosis pathways in both LPS-treated primary chondrocytes and cartilage tissue from MIA-induced osteoarthritis rats.
These results suggest that LMWCP supplementation ameliorates the progression of osteoarthritis through its direct impact on inﬂammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes.

The articular cartilage, a specialized connective tissue, serves to cushion and distribute load within the joint. This cartilage is composed of chondrocytes embedded within an organized extracellular matrix (ECM) of collagen and aggrecan [ 6,7].In osteoarthritis, a chronic cycle of cartilage degradation and inadequate Mar.Drugs 2023 ,21, 608.https://doi.org/10.3390/md21120608 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/marinedrugs Mar.Drugs 2023 ,21, 608 2 of 13 repair mechanisms leads to a net loss of the cartilage matrix.This process is driven by various molecular pathways, including the dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes responsible for cartilage breakdown, and tissue inhibitors of metallopro- teinases (TIMPs), which counteract MMP activity.Moreover, inﬂammation plays a key role in OA pathogenesis.
Synovial inﬂammation, characterized by increased production of pro- inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines, and mediators such as interleukin-1 β(IL-1 β), tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α), and prostaglandins, contributes to cartilage degradation and ex- acerbates joint damage. Additionally, activated immune cells and inﬁltrating macrophages further amplify the inﬂammatory response within the joint microenvironment [8–10].Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently prescribed to alleviate the pain and inﬂammation associated with osteoarthritis.NSAIDs function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), thereby hindering the production of prostaglandins, which are crucial mediators in the inﬂammatory response.Nonetheless, NSAIDs are accompanied by gastrointestinal side effects [ 11,12].Therefore, alternative remedies are often sought for the treatment of osteoarthritis due to their lower risk of side effects and minimal toxicity [ 13,14].
Collagen has recently garnered particular interest among researchers due to its multiple bioactive properties. However, the term “collagen” encompasses a variety of compounds with distinct structures, compositions, and origins, resulting in diverse properties and potential effects.Previous studies have proposed that collagen supplementation could pro- mote the synthesis of connective tissue, especially cartilage ECM, mainly because collagen represents its major component.In fact, it has been demonstrated that certain peptides from hydrolyzed collagen are absorbed and accumulated in the cartilage [ 15–17].Here, we investigated the effect of low-molecular-weight ﬁsh-derived type I collagen hydrolysate (LMWCP; valine-glycine-proline-hydroxyproline-glycine-proline-alanine-glycine), orig- inating from tilapia, in primary chondrocytes and rats with monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis to identify mechanisms underlying the cartilage-regenerating properties of collagen.2.
Results 2.1. LMWCP Ameliorated Cell Damage and the Expression of Catabolic Factors in H2O2-Treated Chondrocytes LMWCP pretreatment ameliorated 200 µM H 2O2-induced cell death (Figure 1A).The mRNA expression levels of anabolic factors, such as aggrecan, collagen type I, collagen type II, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3, were signiﬁcantly decreased in the H 2O2-treated chondro- cytes compared to those in the normal control (NC).However, acetylsalicylic acid (PC) or LMWCP treatment signiﬁcantly increased mRNA expression levels of these anabolic factors in the H 2O2-treated chondrocytes ( p< 0.05; Figure 1B–F).mRNA expression levels of catabolic factors, including MMP-3 and MMP-13, were signiﬁcantly increased in the H2O2-treated chondrocytes compared to those in NC, while acetylsalicylic acid or LMWCP treatment signiﬁcantly increased mRNA expression levels of these catabolic factors in the H2O2-treated chondrocytes ( p< 0.05; Figure 1G,H).
The protein expression levels of catabolic factors, such as Smad3 phosphorylation, MMP-3, and MMP-9, in the H 2O2-treated chondrocytes were investigated. The protein expression level of Smad3 phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly decreased in the H 2O2-treated chondrocytes compared to those in NC, but acetylsalicylic acid or LMWCP treatment signiﬁcantly increased protein expression in the H 2O2-treated chondrocytes.The protein expression levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were increased in the H 2O2-treated chondrocytes compared to those in NC.However, acetylsalicylic acid or LMWCP treatment decreased the protein expression levels in the H 2O2-treated SW982 cells (Figure 1I).2.2.LMWCP Ameliorated Inﬂammation in LPS-Treated Chondrocytes The levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, prostaglandin (PGE) 2, and NO were signif- icantly increased in the LPS-treated chondrocytes compared with those in NC.However, acetylsalicylic acid or LMWCP treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of those factors Mar.

Additionally, MIA-induced osteoarthritis rats exhibited an irreg- ular articular cartilage surface and cartilage matrix degradation, while the joints of non- induced osteoarthritis rats possessed a smooth ar ticular cartilage surface. In contrast, the group treated with ibuprofen or LMWCP exhibited suppressed and morphological changes in the cartilage tissue and displayed an increase in cartilage surface volumes.This suggests that treatment with ibuprofen or LMWCP may have a protective e ﬀect on the integrity and structure of the cartilage tissu e, potentially mitigating the degenerative changes associated with osteoarthritis (Figure 4).Figure 3.Effects of LMWCP on protein expression of apoptosis factors in LPS-treated chondrocytes.NC: no treatment, C: 200 µM of H 2O2treatment, ASA: 200 µM of H 2O2and 10 µM acetylsalicylic acid, 100: 200 µM of H 2O2and 100 µg/mL of LMWCP , 300: 200 µM of H 2O2and 300 µg/mL of LMWCP , 500: 200 µM of H 2O2and 500 µg/mL of LMWCP .

also investigated the levels of collagen-derived peptides in the blood after the ingestion of high tripeptide-containing collagen hydrolysate in humans and transiently identiﬁed 17 types of collagen-derived peptides, with a particular enrich- ment in Gly-Pro-Hyp. Additionally, the authors detected a higher enrichment of Pro-Hyp in the plasma and skin, derived from Gly-Pro-Hyp hydrolysis, upon administration of Gly-Pro-Hyp peptide in a mouse model [ 19].These data suggest that dietary collagen affects the body’s collagen composition.Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of LMWCP on osteoarthritis and compare it with positive controls using ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid.Osteoarthritis is characterized by the progressive deterioration of articular cartilage, primarily driven by MMPs and inﬂammatory substances.Collagen, which constitutes approximately 30% of the body’s total protein, forms the backbone of the extracellular matrix.
Another vital component is aggrecan, a large proteoglycan that is indispensable for normal joint function. The overall quality of the extracellular matrix is crucial in maintaining the functional integrity of cartilage.Speciﬁcally, MMPs, known as collagenases, play a pivotal role in collagen breakdown, making them the primary mediators of this process.MMP-3, also known as stromelysins, primarily target non-collagen matrix proteins, whereas MMP-13, referred to as collagenases, primarily target interstitial collagens such as types I, II, and III.The activity of these MMPs is intricately regulated by TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) [ 20–23].In our study, we observed an increase in MMPs, which was accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA expression levels of key components including aggrecan, collagen, and TIMPs, within the cartilage tissue of rats with MIA- induced osteoarthritis.
However, following the administration of LMWCP , we noted a suppression of these factor changes in the cartilage tissue of rats with MIA-induced osteoarthritis. This suggests that LMWCP effectively inhibits the degradation of ECM (extracellular matrix) within the cartilage tissue.Inﬂammation is a crucial factor in the development and progression of osteoarthritis.The mechanism of osteoarthritis, particularly in relation to inﬂammation, involves various elements, with a signiﬁcant role played by the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κB) and subsequent production of inﬂammatory cytokines.NF- κB is a protein complex that serves as a key regulator of immune and inﬂammatory responses.In osteoarthritis, NF-κB is frequently activated, often in response to factors like cytokines, including IL-1 β and TNF- α, which stimulate the release of MMPs and other catabolic enzymes, thereby exacerbating osteoarthritis [ 24].
In our study, we have demonstrated that treatment with LMWCP effectively suppressed the phosphorylation of I κB and p65, as well as the pro- duction of inﬂammatory mediators in both the LPS-treated primary chondrocytes and the cartilage tissue of rats with MIA-induced osteoarthritis. These ﬁndings strongly suggest that LMWCP treatment provides a protective effect against inﬂammation in chondrocytes by inhibiting the NF- κB signaling pathways.In the development of osteoarthritis, the molecular pathways that regulate chondro- cyte apoptosis are inﬂuenced by various factors, including the activation of signaling cascades [ 25,26].Two signiﬁcant pathways implicated in this process are the JNK/c-Fos and c-Jun pathway, as well as the FADD/caspase8/Bax/caspase3 pathway.The JNK pathway is activated in response to various stress stimuli, including inﬂammation and oxidative stress, which are prevalent in osteoarthritis.
This pathway leads to the activation of transcription factors such as c-Fos and c-Jun, which regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the context of osteoarthritis, the activation of JNK and subsequent upregulation of c-Fos and c-Jun can lead to increased Mar.Drugs 2023 ,21, 608 9 of 13 apoptotic signaling in chondrocytes, contributing to the degradation of articular cartilage.Additionally, the FADD pathway is a key pathway in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway acti- vated by pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the osteoarthritic state.This pathway leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase-8, initiating a caspase cascade, which in turn activates downstream caspases, including caspase-3, a pivotal executioner caspase in apoptosis.
These pathways collectively contribute to the initiation and execution of apoptosis in chondrocytes, ultimately leading to the degradation of articular cartilage observed in osteoarthritis [25–27]. Here, we demonstrated that LMWCP treatment suppressed the activation of the apoptosis pathway in both the LPS-treated primary chondrocytes and the cartilage tissue of rats with MIA-induced osteoarthritis.Therefore, our ﬁndings suggest that LMWCP supplementation can prevent the development of osteoarthritis through the suppression of apoptosis in chondrocytes.Although this study conﬁrmed that LMWCP had a positive effect on joint health, it was not conﬁrmed whether the ingested LMWCP was directly utilized for cartilage production, and therefore, additional studies are needed to clarify this.4.Materials and Methods 4.1.
Preparation of LMWCP The collagen used in this study was puriﬁed from ﬁsh scale collagen originating from tilapia (Oreochromis genus) gelatin, which was sourced from GELTECH in Busan, Korea. First, the dried tilapia scale was treated with HCl and then extracted with hot water.The extract was further puriﬁed by ﬁltering and ion exchange.Then, the puriﬁed material was concentrated and sterilized.The resulting extract was heat-dried and milled, ready as gelatin for the next collagen production.Collagen production was initiated by melting the gelatin, followed by treatment with protease.Then, the solution was deodorized by treating it in an activated carbon tower.Subsequently, the gelatin was puriﬁed multiple times using pulp, carbon, and cartridge ﬁlters.The resulting crude peptides underwent high-temperature treatment (120 ±5◦C) for 10–20 s to ensure sterilization.
The products were then spray-dried at 170–230◦C and 150–230 bar, followed by sieving to achieve an average particle size of 50–150 µm. The low-molecular-weight ﬁsh collagen contained 0.93 mg/g of octapeptide (valine-glycine-proline-hydroxyproline-glycine-proline-alanine- glycine; LMWCP), with an average molecular weight of 667.7 Da.4.2.Primary Culture of Chondrocytes Two Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old, male) were obtained from SaeRon Bio in Ui- wang, Korea, and were humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation.Cartilages were then isolated and incubated overnight in Hank’s balanced salt solution (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) containing 2 mg/mL collagenase (C0130, Sigma-Aldrich Co, St.Louis, MO, USA), and overnight in a shaker at 100 rpm.
The obtained chondrocytes were seeded in 75T ﬂasks and cultured in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 mg/L penicillin- streptomycin (Hyclone Laboratories), and 2 mmol/L glutamine (Hyclone Laboratories). The cultures were maintained at 37◦C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO 2.We performed medium replacement every three days, initiating subculturing when the culture reached approximately 80% conﬂuence.Only cells with a passage number not exceeding 10 were employed for experimental purposes.4.3.Animals and Induction of Osteoarthritis Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old, male) were obtained from SaeRon Bio in Uiwang, Korea.These rats were acclimated in a controlled environment room, with conditions set at 23±2◦C, a 12/12 h light/dark cycle, and a relative humidity of 50 ±5%.
Ethical approval for the experiments was granted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyung Hee University (KHGASP-22-251). Prior to initiating the experiment, the rats were housed in cages for one week to acclimate to their surroundings.To induce osteoarthritis, Mar.Drugs 2023 ,21, 608 10 of 13 anesthesia was administered to all animals using a consistent concentration of isoﬂurane, and 60 mg/mL of MIA was injected into the articular space of the knee joints.
The rats were divided into six groups, each consisting of eight rats, as follows: normal control (NC), 50 µL of saline was injected into both the left/right knee joint + AIN93G; MIA, 50 µL of MIA (60 mg/mL) was injected into both the left/right knee joint + AIN93G; MIA + PC, 50 µL of MIA (60 mg/mL) was injected into both the left/right knee joint + ibuprofen 20 mg/kg body weight (BW) in AIN93G; MIA + 200, 50 µL of MIA (60 mg/mL) was injected into both the left/right knee joint + LMWCP 200 mg/kg BW in AIN93G; MIA + 400, 50 µL of MIA (60 mg/mL) was injected into both the left/right knee joint + LMWCP 400 mg/kg BW in AIN93G; MIA + 600, 50 µL of MIA (60 mg/mL) was injected into both the left/right knee joint + LMWCP 600 mg/kg BW in AIN93G (Table 1). The rats were monitored for clinical signs of osteoarthritis on a weekly basis following the MIA injection, clinical signs were assessed by observing swelling in the knee joint of rats to determine the presence or absence of inﬂammation.
After completion of the experiment (Figure 8), rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane, followed by blood collection through the abdominal vena cava. Subsequently, the hearts were excised and euthanized, and both blood and knee joint tissues were stored at−70◦C until each experiment.Table 1.Experimental groups ( n= 8).Group Diet Supplement MIA Normal control AIN93G − − MIA AIN93G − + MIA + PC AIN93G Ibuprofen 20 mg/kg BW + MIA + 200 AIN93G LMWCP 200 mg/kg BW + MIA + 400 AIN93G LMWCP 400 mg/kg BW + MIA + 600 AIN93G LMWCP 600 mg/kg BW + Mar.Drugs 2023 , 21, x 11 of 14 performed medium replacement every three da ys, initiating subculturing when the cul- ture reached approximately 80% con ﬂuence.Only cells with a passage number not ex- ceeding 10 were employed for experimental purposes.4.3.Animals and Induction of Osteoarthritis Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old, male) were obtained from SaeRon Bio in Uiwang, Korea.
