However, for pregnant women (PW) with high iron demand, ignoring the phenomenon of carrying the thalassemia genes combined with IDA may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: The hematological phenotype indexes of 15,051 PW who received a prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia in our hospital were analyzed, and the plasma ferritin (PF) of 714 anemic pregnant women (APW) was determined.Results: The results showed that 87.43% of APW without thalassemia suffered from IDA.Among APW with various thalassemia genotypes, we found that 40.00∼77.78% of subjects with α-thalassemia silent genotypes [αCS(orQS)α/αα(40.00%), – α3.7(or 4.2)/αα(57.65%), and αWSα/αα(77.78%)] and 18.18∼84.21% of subjects with α-thalassemia minor genotypes [ αCS(orQS)α/– α3.7(or 4.2)(18.18%), – α3.7(or 4.2)/–α3.7(or 4.2)(40.00%), αα/–SEA(44.55%), and αWSα/–α3.7(or 4.2)(84.21%)] developed IDA, while in subjects with α- thalassemia intermedia genotypes, only αWSα/–SEAwas associated with IDA, with an incidence of 16.67%.
However, the incidence of IDA in APW with common β-thalassemia minor genotypes ( βCD17 (A>T)/β,βCD41 /42(−TTCT )/β, βCD71 /72(+A)/β,βIVS−II−654(C>T)/β, and β−28(A>G)/β) was less than 10.85%. In addition, the APW with β-thalassemia minor had a higher PF level than the APW without thalassemia.Frontiers in Nutrition 01 frontiersin.org fnut-09-1005951 September 19, 2023 Time: 15:51 # 2 Wang et al.10.3389/fnut.2022.1005951 Conclusion: Our study is the ﬁrst to reveal differences in the prevalence of IDA among PW with various thalassemia genotypes, indicating that the possibility of IDA should be fully considered when managing PW with α-thalassemia silent or minor genotypes in high-risk areas, and that iron supplementation should be monitored dynamically for PW with β-thalassemia minor genotypes.KEYWORDS iron-deﬁciency anemia (IDA), pregnancy, prevalence, iron supplementation, thalassemia Introduction Thalassemia is one of the most widespread autosomal monogenic diseases in the world.
In clinical practice, α- thalassemia and β-thalassemia are the most common subtypes, and the hematological phenotype of diﬀerent genotypes showed obvious heterogeneity (1). At the molecular level, depending on the number of functional α- and β-globin genes retained, α-gene defects can be classiﬁed into α+andα0, and β-gene defects can be classiﬁed into β+andβ0(2, 3).Carriers of α-thalassemia silent genotypes ( α+α/αα) often have no clinical phenotype and are mostly found in population screening.Carriers of α- or β-thalassemia minor genotypes ( α+α/α+α,α0α/αα,β+/β, and β0/β) present with microcytosis, mild anemia or no anemia, and no treatment is required.Patients with α- orβ-thalassemia intermedia genotypes ( α0α/α+α,β+/β+, and some β0/β+) can develop mild to moderate anemia with age and some require lifelong transfusion therapy.
While infants with α-thalassemia major ( α0/α0) are usually stillborn or die quickly after birth, and infants with β-thalassemia major genotypes (some β0/β+,β0/β0) develop progressive hemolytic anemia 3–6 months after birth and die before 5 years if untreated. Iron-deﬁciency anemia (IDA) is caused by insuﬃcient iron intake, poor iron absorption, or excessive iron loss.Because of the increasing demand for iron in women’s own and fetal development during pregnancy, the WHO recommends maternal iron supplements to avoid adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by IDA (4–6).However, due to the combined eﬀects of chronic hemolysis, iron utilization disorder, or repeated blood transfusion in thalassemia carriers, iron supplementation is generally not recommended since it may lead to diﬀerent levels of iron overload.

In addition, we searched relevant literature and found that there was no study to report diﬀerences in IDA prevalence among PW with various genotypes of thalassemia.
Therefore, this paper aims to reveal the diﬀerence in iron metabolism of PW with various thalassemia genotypes and provide scientiﬁc reference for clinical individualized management of such a population. Materials and methods Participants This study was conducted based on the “Hainan Pregnancy Thalassemia Screening Program, ” which was implemented in 2019 in Hainan Province to provide free blood routine tests and genetic diagnosis of thalassemia for PW and their partners.All participants were recruited from medical institutions within 14 cities and counties in Hainan.Cases with MCV values less than 82 fL were considered possible carriers of thalassemia (7).The subjects of this study were PW who underwent prenatal genetic diagnosis of thalassemia in Hainan Women and Children’s Medical Center from August 2019 to December 2021.The age of the PW ranged from 13 to 54 years, with a median age of 28 years.
The gestational ages of PW were between 4 and 39 weeks, and early pregnancy (4 ∼12 weeks) accounted for about 53.9%, the second trimester (13 ∼27 weeks) accounted for about 40.8%, the third trimester (after 28 weeks) accounted for about 5.3%. The majority of subjects were screened for hematological parameters and thalassemia genes for the ﬁrst time during pregnancy, so most subjects did not receive professional iron supplementation before screening, but multivitamin supplementation could not be excluded.All studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hainan Women and Children’s Medical Center.Frontiers in Nutrition 02 frontiersin.org fnut-09-1005951 September 19, 2023 Time: 15:51 # 3 Wang et al.
10.3389/fnut.2022.1005951 Measurements of hematological phenotype indexes and plasma ferritin levels, as well as gene diagnosis of thalassemia According to the recommendation of the World Health Organization, anemia in pregnancy can be diagnosed when the Hb concentration of the PW is less than 110 g/L. Meanwhile, according to the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Iron Deﬁciency (ID) and Iron-Deﬁciency Anemia during Pregnancy in China (2014), when the plasma ferritin (PF) level is below 30 ng/mL, early iron depletion is considered and iron supplementation should be performed (8).Peripheral blood samples of 4 mL volume were taken from all participants and collected into two Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) anti-coagulated tubes on average.The hematological phenotype indexes were measured and analyzed by the hemocyte analyzer at the medical institutions where the subjects were located.
When the MCV value of the pregnant woman or her partner was less than 82 fL, the peripheral blood of both the couple was collected. Then the peripheral blood samples were immediately transported to our center by cold chain (The temperature was 4 ∼8◦C, and the specimen transportation was generally completed within 2∼5 days) for the genetic diagnosis of thalassemia.If the Hb concentration of the pregnant woman was below 110 g/L and suﬃcient qualiﬁed plasma could be successfully isolated, the plasma was collected for ferritin level determination.A ﬂow chart of this study is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 .PF levels were measured using the Elecsys Ferritin kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).The gap- polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify α-globin gene deletion mutations (#20193401915, Y aneng Biosciences, Shenzhen, China).
Reverse dot-blot hybridization was used to identify non-deletional mutations of α- and β-thalassemia (#20173401107, #20163400463, Y aneng Biosciences, Shenzhen, China). A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence was used to detect rare thalassemia gene mutations.Statistics Graphpad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analyses.Comparison of composition ratios between two or more groups using Fisher’s exact test or the chi- square test followed by the Bonferroni method.The unpaired Student’s t-tests or Welch’s t-tests were used to determine statistical signiﬁcance between two groups.If the variance of multiple groups was the same, a one-way ANOV A was used to compare the mean of multiple groups; otherwise, the Kruskal– Wallis H-test was used.The data were given as Mean ±SD.
AP-value of <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.Results Analysis of anemia prevalence and hematological phenotype indexes in pregnant women with various thalassemia genotypes The anemia rate and hematological phenotype indexes of 15,051 PW who underwent prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia in our hospital from August 2019 to December 2021 were analyzed. The results showed that a total of 1,219 anemic pregnant women (APW) were detected in 5,365 PW without thalassemia genotypes, and the prevalence of anemia in PW without thalassemia was 22.72%.The anemia rate in PW with ﬁve common α-thalassemia silent genotypes ranged from 16.25 to 22.03%, and no statistical diﬀerence was found.For α- thalassemia minor genotypes, the anemia rates of αWSα/αQSα, αWSα/αWSα,αWSα/–α3.7, and αWSα/–α4.2were signiﬁcantly lower than those of other α-thalassemia minor genotypes, ranging from 18.18 to 25.00%.The anemia rates of αα/– SEA, –α3.7/–α3.7, –α3.7/–α4.2, and – α4.2/–α4.2ranged from 35.96 to 37.82% ( P>0.05).
While αQSα/–α3.7(71.19%) and αQSα/–α4.2(65.00%) had higher anemia rates than other α- thalassemia minor genotypes. For α-thalassemia intermedia genotypes, the anemia rates of – α3.7/–SEA, –α4.2/–SEA, and αWSα/–SEAwere 98.65, 98.65, and 45.61%, respectively, and αWSα/–SEAhad a signiﬁcantly lower anemia rate than the former two genotypes.Among six common β-thalassemia minor genotypes, the incidence of anemia from high to low wasβIVS−II−654(C>T)/β(83.04%), βCD41 /42(−TTCT )/β(78.44%), βCD17 (A>T)/β(76.54%), βCD71 /72(+A)/β(75.00%), β−28(A>G)/β (36.29%), and βCD26 (GAG>AAG)/β(17.50%), and the latter two genotypes had signiﬁcantly lower anemia rates than the ﬁrst four.The anemia rates of PW with β-thalassemia minor genotypes were signiﬁcantly higher than that of PW without thalassemia, except βCD26 (GAG>AAG)/β.The anemia prevalence among PW with various genotypes of thalassemia was shown in Figure 1A .
Analysis of hematological phenotype indexes showed that αWSαcaused the least severe hematology phenotype among ﬁve common α+-thalassemia genes. When αWSαwas co-inherited with other α+-thalassemia genes, the Hb and MCH levels of the genotypes ( αWSα/–α3.7,αWSα/–α4.2,αWSα/αWSα, and αWSα/αQSα) were higher than those of other common α- thalassemia minor genotypes ( αα/–SEA, –α3.7/–α3.7, –α4.2/– α4.2, –α3.7/–α4.2,αQSα/–α3.7,αQSα/–α4.2).When αWSαwas co-inherited with –SEA, the Hb and MCH levels of the genotype (αWSα/–SEA) were signiﬁcantly higher than those of –SEA/– α3.7and –SEA/–α4.2.The severity of hematological phenotypes caused by – α3.7and – α4.2tend to be consistent.There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in Hb and MCH levels of – α3.7/– α3.7, –α4.2/–α4.2, –α3.7/–α4.2, and the values of hematological Frontiers in Nutrition 03 frontiersin.org fnut-09-1005951 September 19, 2023 Time: 15:51 # 4 Wang et al.

The Hb and MCH levels of β−28(A>G)/βandβCD26 (GAG>AAG)/βwere signiﬁcantly higher than those of the above four β-thalassemia genotypes. The analysis of hematological phenotype indexes among PW with various genotypes of thalassemia is shown in Table 1 .Incidence of iron deﬁciency in anemic pregnant women with various genotypes of thalassemia PF levels were measured in 714 APW who underwent a prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia in our hospital.Some genotypes were combined and grouped according to similar anemia prevalence and hematological parameters as shown inTable 2 .The results showed that 87.43% of anemia in APW without thalassemia was caused by ID.There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the incidence of ID among the ﬁve α-thalassemia silent genotypes, but it can be seen that the ID rate was the highest in αWSα/αα(77.78%), followed by–α(3.7or4.2)/αα(57.65%), and αCS(orQS)α/αα(40.00%).
For α- thalassemia minor genotypes, the ID rate of αWSα/–α(3.7or 4.2)(84.21%) was signiﬁcantly higher than those of other α- thalassemia minor genotypes. Although the incidence of ID was not signiﬁcant among carriers of –SEA/αα(44.55%), – α(3.7or4.2)/–α(3.7or4.2)(40.00%), and αCS(orQS)α/–α(3.7or4.2) (18.18%), it is seen that the ID rate of αCS(orQS)α/–α(3.7or4.2) was obviously lower than those of the other above genotypes.In addition, two APW with αWSα/αWSαand one APW with αQSα/αQSαwere not included in statistical analysis due to the small number of cases.Two APW with αWSα/αWSαdeveloped IDA, while APW with αQSα/αQSαhad mild anemia and without ID.For α-thalassemia intermediate genotypes, no ID was found in carriers of – α3.7/–SEA, –α4.2/–SEA, and αCSα/–SEA, while ID was found in one of six carriers of αWSα/–SEA.
For common β-thalassemia minor genotypes, βIVS−II−654(C>T)/β, βCD41 /42(−TTCT )/β,βCD17 (A>T)/β, and βCD71 /72(+A)/βwere combined into one group due to similar anemia prevalence and Hb, MCH levels. The ID rates of the above four genotypes and β−28(A>G)/βwere 10.85 and 10.00%, respectively.One APW with βCD26 (GAG>AAG)/βwas not included in the statistical analysis, and the carrier did not develop ID.The incidence of ID in APW with α+β-thalassemia genotypes included in this study was 30%.The results are shown in Figure 1B .In addition, by comparing Hb levels of APW with or without ID, we found that in general, the Hb levels of APW with ID were slightly lower than those of APW without ID.For APW with thalassemia minor genotypes, the carriers of αCS(or QS )α/–α3.7(or 4.2)and common β-thalassemia minor genotypes had obviously higher PF levels than APW without thalassemia ( Table 2 ).Frontiers in Nutrition 04 frontiersin.org fnut-09-1005951 September 19, 2023 Time: 15:51 # 5 Wang et al.

The high-frequent genotypes of α-thalassemia in Hainan were – α3.7/αα, –α4.2/αα,αα/–SEA,αWSα/αα, –α3.7/– α4.2,αWSα/–α3.7, –α3.7/–α3.7, –α4.2/–α4.2,αWSα/–α4.2,αQSα/αα, and the high-frequent genotypes of β-thalassemia were βCD41 /42(−TTCT )/β,β−28(A>G)/β,βIVS−II−654(C>T)/β, βCD71 /72(+A)/β,βCD17 (A>T)/β,βCD26 (GAG>AAG)/βin turn (9). Some of the above genotypes are also prevalent worldwide (1, 2).In this study, we analyzed the anemia prevalence and hematological parameters in PW with or without the aforementioned genotypes of thalassemia.The results showed that the anemia rate in PW without thalassemia (22.72%) was much lower than that of PW with thalassemia genotypes, except for the genotypes of α-thalassemia silent and βCD26 (GAG>AAG)/β.The anemia prevalence among various genotypes was consistent with the severity of clinical phenotypes caused by diﬀerent thalassemia genotypes.

When αQSαwas co-inherited with –α3.7or –α4.2, the anemia rate and hematological phenotype severity of αQSα/–α3.7andαQSα/–α4.2were signiﬁcantly higher than those of other common α-thalassemia minor genotypes and αWSα/–SEA. The severity of hematological phenotypes caused by diﬀerent α+-thalassemia genes is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies (2).Among β-thalassemia genes, the anemia rate and the Hb and MCH levels caused byβIVS−II−654(C>T)(β+) were similar to those of common β0-thalassemia genes ( βCD41 /42(−TTCT ),βCD17 (A>T), and βCD71 /72(+A)) (P>0.05).But the anemia rates induced byβ−28(A>G)(β+) and βCD26 (GAG>AAG)(β+) were obviously lower than those of the above four β-genes, and the Hb and MCH levels were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the above four β-genes.
These results also revealed that the anemia prevalence and hematological phenotype severity of the four common β-thalassemia minor genotypes were higher than those of the common α-thalassemia minor genotypes and αWSα/–SEAin Hainan Island. Prevalence of iron deﬁciency in anemic pregnant women with various genotypes of thalassemia In this study, we ﬁrst analyzed the anemia rate and hematological parameters of PW with diﬀerent thalassemia genotypes by a large sample study to obtain the general hematological phenotypic characteristics of each genotype.Subsequently, we combined the genotypes with similar hematologic phenotypic characteristics, and further analyzed the diﬀerences of ID in APW with various thalassemia genotypes, so as to provide data reference for clinical individualized management of such a population.The PF levels were determined in 714 APW who underwent prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia in our hospital.
The results suggested Frontiers in Nutrition 06 frontiersin.org fnut-09-1005951 September 19, 2023 Time: 15:51 # 7 Wang et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.1005951 that the incidence of IDA varied among various genotypes.Among the 183 APW without thalassemia, 87.43% were associated with IDA, indicating that ID is the main cause of anemia in PW in Hainan region.Due to the small number of carriers of speciﬁc genotypes included in this study, some genotypes were combined and grouped according to similar anemia rates and hematological parameters.For APW with α- thalassemia silent genotypes, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the incidence of IDA among diﬀerent genotypes, but it can be seen that the ID rate was the highest in αWSα/αα, followed by – α(3.7 or 4 .2)/αα, and αCS(or QS )α/αα.For APW with α-thalassemia minor genotypes, αWSα/–α(3.7 or 4 .2)had the highest incidence of IDA, followed by –SEA/αα, –α(3.7 or 4.2)/–α(3.7 or 4 .2), and αCS(or QS )α/–α(3.7 or 4 .2).
Among α-thalassemia intermediate genotypes, ID was only found in carriers of αWSα/–SEA, and with a low incidence. These results showed that APW with α-thalassemia silent or minor genotypes had higher ID rates and that the prevalence of IDA is inversely correlated with the severity of the hematological phenotype induced by thalassemia genotypes.Among six common β-thalassemia minor genotypes with high prevalence in Hainan, the ID rates of βCD17 (A>T)/β,βCD41 /42(−TTCT )/β, βCD71 /72(+A)/β,βIVS−II−654(C>T)/β, and β−28(A>G)/βwas less than 10.85%.In addition, the APW with common β-thalassemia minor genotypes had obviously higher PF levels than APW without thalassemia, which is consistent with Hoorfar’s study that showed β-thalassemia minor may play a role in improving iron status in females and may lead to iron overload in males (10).
Physiological anemia during pregnancy may aggravate the anemia symptoms in carriers of thalassemia minor genotypes, thus aﬀecting maternal and fetal health and even causing long-term adverse eﬀects on newborns. Anymore, a few studies have shown that iron supplementation in carriers of thalassemia with IDA during the third trimester can beneﬁt both mother and baby (11).Although there is no large sample, multicenter randomized controlled study that has yet conﬁrmed the need for routine iron supplementation in PW with thalassemia minor genotypes, we suggest that the ferritin levels of APW with β-thalassemia minor genotypes should be monitored dynamically during iron supplementation, since most carriers do not develop ID and have high PF levels.In conclusion, the possibility of IDA should be fully considered in the clinical management of PW with thalassemia genotypes to avoid adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially for those who with α-thalassemia silent and some minor genotypes.
