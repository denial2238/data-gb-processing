The linearities for the 5 substances were studied in the range between 2 and 100 mg/L and the coef ﬁcients of determi- nation (R2) were always >0.995. Matrix effects were also assessed by comparing the slopes obtained in solvent and chicken breast matrix.The recoveries for all the substances at 3 different spike levels (5, 10 and 50 mg/kg) were in the range 80-102% with RSDs <15%.The instrumental limits of quanti ﬁcation were in the range 2.7-4.8 mg/kg, while the reporting level of the method was 5 mg/kg for all the aforementioned compounds.The method was successfully applied to 10 chicken breasts samples from the local market.Keywords: Chicken breast, GC-MS/MS, Phytogenic compounds, QuEChERS 1.Introduction Antibiotics and antimicrobials are not only used as veterinary drugs to prevent and control diseases in animal rearing but also asgrowth promoters [ 1].
For this latter purpose they are added to animal feed ea practice that can lead to residues in edible animal products that are potentially dangerous for human health or induceantibiotic resistance of microbes even at smalldoses [ 2]. This led to the ban of antibiotics as growth promoters by the European Union since 2006 [ 3].Global meat consumption has seen an increase by 58% in the past two decades and in particularchicken meat consumption has increased, as it is not only a source of high-quality protein, important vitamin and minerals, but also the cheapest of alllivestock meats [ 4].The aforementioned ban of antibiotic growth promoters has fostered the research for alternativesubstances: phytogenic feed additives (PFA) are suggested to be among the most promising ones [ 5].
PFA are composed of plant-derived natural mate-rials with positive effects on animal growth andhealth, and this de ﬁnition applies to preparations of ground herbs and spices, essential oils (EOs), ex-tracts and/or oleoresins. PFA contain secondary plant metabolites (phytochemicals) and encompass a wide range of chemical compound classes,including phenols, terpenes, alkaloids, lectins, al-dehydes and ketones.The various mechanisms ofaction are not yet fully understood but involveantimicrobial/antiviral, antioxidative and anti-inﬂammation activity [ 6].Several companies offer feed additives containing PFA in their portfolio and so it is important to determine their residues in edible animal productswithin the scope of consumer safety assessment [ 7].We hence developed a method for the quantitativedetermination of the following ﬁve phytochemicals in chicken breast: carvone, menthol, thymol, carva-crol and methyl salicylate.

A generic QuEChERSextraction method involves a ﬁrst step in which the analytes of interest are extracted by using an organicsolvent (normally acetonitrile) in presence of inor-ganic salts (like MgSO 4or NaCl) to ensure a salting out effect. The extract is then cleaned with disper- sive sorbents to remove matrix interferences [ 12].This method involves so, a simple QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe)sample preparation procedure followed by detec-tion by gas chromatography coupled with tandemmass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).2.Materials and methods 2.1.Reagents and solutions Ultra-pure water (18.2 M Ucm-1) was obtained in- house using a Millipore water puri ﬁcation system (Cork, Ireland).Acetonitrile LC-MS grade waspurchased form Chem-Lab NV (Zedelgem,Belgium).
QuEChERS original method (4 g MgSO 4and 1 g NaCl) and QuEChERS d-SPE (dispersive Solid Phase Extraction) Animal Origin Food 5982-4950(50 mg PSA, 150 mg C18EC and 900 mg Na 2SO4) were obtained from Agilent technologies. 2.2.GC-MS/MS instrumentation and settings The GC-MS/MS analyses were conducted with a Shimadzu GC 2010 gas chromatograph coupledwith a Shimadzu TQ-8050 tandem mass spectrom-eter (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).The system wasequipped with a PTV (Programmed TemperatureVaporization) injection inlet and an AOC-5000autosampler.GC-MS Real Time Analysis and GC-MS Postrun Analysis software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) were used for instrument control and data analysis, respectively.
The GC analysis was per-formed on a J &W DB5-MS þDG column (length 30 m, id 0.25 mm, ﬁlm thickness 0.25 mmþ10 m Guard Column), the chromatographic conditionswere the following: carrier gas helium (minimumpurity 99.9995%) in constant linear velocity mode at30 cm/sec, PTV Injector 60-200 /C14C at 240/C14C/min 1 min then 330/C14C for 19 min, septum purge 6 mL/ min, Split 1:1; GC oven temperature program of 40 /C14C for 1 min, ramp 20/C14C/min to 130/C14C, hold 7.0 min then 40/C14C/min until 280/C14C (held for 3 min), injec- tion volume 1 mL. The mass spectrometer was operated in MRM mode (MRM transitions of all ﬁve analytes and the internal standard (IS) in Table 1 ) with the following conditions: electron impact ionization at 70 eV, MStransfer line temperature 280 /C14C, MS source tem- perature 200/C14C, solvent delay 9.6 min, dwell time 300 ms, collision gas argon (minimum purity99.9999%) with a collision cell pressure of 200 kPaand detector gain ﬁxed at 1.4 kV.2.3.
Phytogenic compounds standards, internal standard solution preparation All high purity phytogenic compounds standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Mixed standard solutions of the analytes were prepared in acetonitrile by diluting the stock solu-tions to concentrations of 50, 400, 800, 1200, 1600 and 2000 mg/mL.The internal standard (IS; Butyrophe- none) solution was prepared at a concentration of200mg/mL in acetonitrile as well.The calibration solutions were prepared in tripli- cate (n ¼3) by spiking 240 mL of phytogenics-free chicken breast extract with 30 mL of the appropriate standard solutions of the analytes to obtain con-centrations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mg/mL.The concentration of the IS in each sample was main- tained at 10 ppb by adding 30 mL of the IS stock solution.In this way each matrix matched standardsolution contained the same amount of matrix andpure solvent.2.4.Samples Samples of chicken breast were purchased from the local market in Austria.
Each sample was ho-mogenized with the use of a Retsch Mixer Mill MM400 and stored at /C020 /C14C before analysis. 2.5.Sample preparation One g of homogenized chicken breast was weighed in a Retsch stainless steel jar, 1 mL of ul- trapure water, 2 mL of acetonitrile and 0.7 g ofAgilent QuEChERS original method salts wereadded; the jar was closed and the sample wasextracted using a Retsch Mixer Mill MM 400 for2 min at 30 Hz.Hereafter 1.5 mL of the solution weretaken, transferred in a 1.5 mL glass vial and256 JOURNAL OF FOOD AND DRUG ANALYSIS 2021;29:255 e261 ORIGINAL ARTICLE centrifuged for 5 min at 3234 rcf.An aliquot of 700mL of the supernatant was transferred in a 1.5 mL glass vial containing 105 mg of QuEChERSDispersive SPE, the content of the vial was vortexedfor 1 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 14000 rcf.The sample was then transferred into a GC vial andonly at this point the IS was added, to avoid lossesduring the sample preparation.The IS was used to compensate e.g.
for detector and injection volume ﬂuctuations [ 13]. 2.6.Method validation The following performance characteristics were evaluated for the validation of the method: selec-tivity, identi ﬁcation, linearity, matrix effects, limits of quanti ﬁcation (LOQ), recoveries and precision.2.7.Selectivity The selectivity was veri ﬁed by analyzing chicken breast samples that were free of the compounds ofinterest and the presence of peaks that could inter-fere with those substances were assessed.2.8.Identi ﬁcation The criteria used for the identi ﬁcation of analytes were retention time (Rt) and the presence and therelative intensities of three MRM transitions (onequanti ﬁer and two quali ﬁers).According to SANTE 2019 criteria, the Rt of a compound of interest in a sample should not vary more than ±0.1 min compared to a calibration standard and, the relativeintensities for the samples should be within ±30% (relative) of average of calibration standards fromthe same sequence [ 14].2.9.
Linearity Linearity was assessed by measuring six points calibration curves in triplicate (2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and100 ppb ecorresponding to a range of 4 to 200 mg/kg in chicken breast) prepared in acetonitrile and inblank chicken breast extracts as well. 2.10.Matrix effects In order to assess the suppression or enhance- ment of the signal of the analytes due to the matrix,the slopes obtained from the linearity study wereused to calculate the percentage of the matrix effect(%ME), according to the following formula:Table 1.MRM Transitions of the investigated phytogenic compounds and an internal standard.

LOQ The instrumental LOQ were determined following [ 16]: the standard deviation of a number of samples at a low concentration was determined.Multiplying this standard deviation (SD) with 3.3 *ta (tathe Student 's t correlating to the number of samples the standard deviation is based on) givesthe LOQ. LOQ¼SD*3.3*ta The reporting level of the method was set at the spike level (see Recoveries and precision) in whichthe SANTE 2019 criteria (70-120% recoveries rangewith a 20% RSD) were ful ﬁlled [ 14].2.12.Recoveries and precision Recoveries and precision were evaluated by spiking chicken breast samples that were free of thecompounds of interest and preparing them accord-ingly to the procedure outlined in the Samplepreparation.The recoveries were determined for six replicates prepared on three different days (day 1, day 2 ¼day 1 þ24h and day 3 ¼day 1 þ144h) at three different spike levels: 5, 10 and 50 mg/kg.
The average intraday and interday recoveries and therelative standard deviation (RSD) were calculated asthe ratio of the analyte-to-IS peak area and the re-sults were evaluated for compliance to the SANTE2019 criteria, according to which the average re- covery should be in the range 70-120% with an RSD less or equal 20%.3. Results and discussion 3.1.Method development 3.1.1.GC-MS/MS conditions The GC parameters (initial PTV injector temper- ature and ramp rate, initial and ﬁnal column tem- peratures, as well as the column temperature ramprate and carrier gas ﬂow rate) were optimized to achieve the best sensitivity and chromatographicseparation.It was possible to achieve chromato-graphic separation for all the compounds of interestand the IS, see Fig.1 .
In order to ﬁnd the best MRM transitions the Shimadzu MRM Optimization Tool 1.14 (Shimadzu,Kyoto, Japan) software was used: this software au-tomates the process by collecting product ion scandata and ﬁnding the optimum collision energy for each transition. Three MRM transitions per analytewere chosen: one quanti ﬁer and two quali ﬁers.3.2.Sample preparation The selection of the right sorbent is critical in order to minimize matrix interferences and achievegood and consistent analytes recoveries.Due to thenature of our matrix we decided to use an animalorigin food sorbent.We evaluated the ef ﬁciency of the dSPE step by measuring extracts which have been treated or non-treated with the dSPE sorbent in Full Scan mode, and then comparing the sum ofthe areas of the chromatographic peaks in the TICchromatograms (m/z 50-600) [ 17].The reduction for the treated was in the range of 60%.3.3.Method validation 3.3.1.
Selectivity No interfering peaks that could prevent the identi ﬁcation or the quanti ﬁcation of the com- pounds of interest were observed in 12 differentchicken breast samples that were analyzed. In Fig.1.MRM chromatogram of the chicken breast spiked with target analytes at the concentration of 10 mg/kg with the assigned peaks.258 JOURNAL OF FOOD AND DRUG ANALYSIS 2021;29:255 e261 ORIGINAL ARTICLE addition, 10 procedural blanks were prepared as well [ 18].Also, in this case no interfering peaks were detected.3.3.2.Identi ﬁcation The SANTE 2019 criteria mentioned before were fulﬁlled by the matrix matched standards and all the reals samples as well.In Fig.2 a chromatogram of a real sample is shown.3.3.3.Linearity Good linearity was achieved for all the com- pounds of interest in the measured calibration rangewith a coef ﬁcient of determination (R2) al- ways >0.995 in pure solvent and matrix as well.3.3.4.Matrix effects The matrix effect results, expressed as %ME are shown in Table 2 .
Signal enhancement was observed for all investigated substances, this is themost common behavior for GC where the matrixcomponents block the active sites of the column [ 19]. Only for menthol the %ME is below ±20% so we decided to validate the method with matrix matched calibration.Not surprisingly the %ME for the two isomers thymol and carvacrol are very similar.Fig.2.MRM chromatogram of a real chicken breast sample with the assigned peaks.Table 2.%ME of investigated analytes, LOQ ( mg/kg), accuracy and precision.Conc.in mg/kg and precision data are given in parenthesis as % coefﬁcient of variation.Analyte ME% LOQ ( mg/kg) Conc.

LOQ Instrumental LOQ were determined by injecting 10 times the lowest matrix matched standard at4mg/kg, the instrumental LOQs were always below the lowest calibration level and are reported inTable 2 .The SANTE 2019 criteria were ful ﬁlled at the lowest spike level of 5 mg/kg and so the reporting level for the method was set at this concentration.3.3.6.
Recoveries and precision The recoveries and the associated accuracy and precision values were within the acceptable in-terval of the SANTE 2019 criteria for all the threespike levels and both for intraday and interdaymeasurements. The overall results are shown in Table 2 .3.4.Application to real samples The validated method was applied to 10 samples of chicken breast bought in the local market.Asshown in table 3 all the substances of interest were detected in the samples in amounts above the LOQ and with a quite variable range among the different samples, from just above the LOQ for thymol to104mg/kg for methyl salicylate.From a consumer safety point of view, all the analyzed substances have been assessed andcurrently authorized for food [ 20] and feed [ 21] uses.For menthol and carvone an acceptable daily intake(ADI) is established, and it is equal to 4 mg/kg body weight for menthol [ 22] and 60 mg/kg body weight for carvone [ 23].
Even taking the highest concen- trations found in the real samples the chronicexposure is more than 5 orders of magnitude belowthe aforementioned ADIs. 4.Conclusions A simple analytical method involving a QuECh- ERS extraction followed by a dSPE cleanup step coupled with GC-MS/MS determination was demonstrated to be suitable for the quanti ﬁcation of phytochemical residues in chicken breast, a com-plex food matrix.The method has been validatedaccording to the SANTE 2019 criteria for accuracyand precision.It was applied to real chicken breastsamples and revealed the presence of the com-pounds of interest in all of them, however well below any level of concern for the consumer safety.This is possibly an indication of the widespread useof phytogenic feed additives after the ban of anti-biotics as growth promoters by the European Unionin 2006.References [1] Dibner JJ, Richards JD.Antibiotic growth promoters in agriculture: history and mode of action.
