How Xoc overcomes stomatal immunity is unclear. Here, we show that the effector protein AvrRxo1, an ATP- dependent protease, enhances Xoc virulence and inhibits stomatal immunity by targeting and degrading rice OsPDX1 (pyridoxal phosphate synthase), thereby reducing vitamin B6 (VB6) levels in rice.VB6 is required for the activity of aldehyde oxidase, which catalyzes the last step of abscisic acid (ABA) biosyn- thesis, and ABA positively regulates rice stomatal immunity against Xoc.Thus, we provide evidence sup- porting a model in which a major bacterial pathogen inhibits plant stomatal immunity by directly targeting VB6 biosynthesis and consequently inhibiting the biosynthesis of ABA in guard cells to open stomata.Moreover, AvrRxo1-mediated VB6 targeting also explains the poor nutritional quality, including low VB6 levels, of Xoc-infected rice grains.

(2022).The bacterial effector AvrRxo1 inhibits vitamin B6 biosynthesis to promote infection in rice.Plant Comm.3, 100324.INTRODUCTION Rice leaf streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzicola (Xoc) is a disease subject to international quarantine that seri- ously affects rice yield in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, northern Australia, and parts of West Africa.The incidence and severity of the disease are increasing in parts of Asia where hybridrice varieties are grown ( Nino-Liu et al., 2006 ).Xoc shares high genomic DNA sequence identity with X.oryzae pv.oryzae (Xoo), which causes rice bacterial blight, but the two pathogens interact with rice in different manners.
For example, Xoc invades rice leaves mainly through stomata and colonizes leaf intercellular spaces, whereas Xoo enters rice leaves through hydathodes and multiplies in the xylem. Xoo secretes transcription activator-like effectors through the type three secre- tion system (T3SS) to induce rice genes, including SWEET -family sugar transporter genes, as part of its pathogenesis mechanism(Yang et al., 2006 ;Chen et al., 2012 ).More than 40 resistance ( R)genes against Xoo have been identiﬁed in rice, whereas rice exhibits no Rgenes conferring resistance against Xoc strains from Asia ( Zhao et al., 2005 ).The Xoc effector AvrRxo1, which is highly conserved in all tested strains of Xoc, was previously found to suppress nonhost resistance to Xoo inNicotiana ben- thamiana (Liu et al., 2014 ).However, it is unclear whether AvrRxo1 plays a virulence role in its native host plant, rice, owingto the lack of an AvrRxo1-knockout mutant.
AvrRxo1 also in- duces hypersensitive cell death in maize carrying the maize Rxo1 gene ( Zhao et al., 2005 ) and is toxic to bacteria, yeast, and plants ( Zhao et al., 2004 ;Liu et al., 2014 ;Han et al., 2015 ; Triplett et al., 2016 ). Structural analysis has shown that AvrRxo1 contains a T4 polynucleotide kinase domain and is Published by the Plant Communications Shanghai Editorial Ofﬁce in association with Cell Press, an imprint of Elsevier Inc., on behalf of CSPB andCEMPS, CAS.Plant Communications 3, 100324, May 9 2022 ª2022 The Author(s).This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).1Plant Communications Research Articlellll involved in phosphorylating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to generate 3 ʹ-NADP in plants ( Han et al., 2015 ;Schuebel et al., 2016 ;Triplett et al., 2016 ;Shidore et al., 2017 ).However, this does not provide a clear explanation for the role of AvrRxo1 in pathogenicity.
During our study of the virulence function of AvrRxo1, we found that AvrRxo1 promotes the virulence of Xoc and its infection strategy by directly targeting the biosynthesis of vitamin B6 (VB6), which we found to be required for the biosyn- thesis of abscisic acid (ABA). The AvrRxo1-mediated inhibition ofVB6 biosynthesis revealed a previously unknown step in ABA biosynthesis in plants and highlighted a novel mechanism of pathogen-mediated stomatal immunity suppression that isdependent on ABA.In addition, the effect of AvrRxo1 on VB6 biosynthesis explains the poor nutritional quality, such as low VB6 levels, of Xoc-infected rice grains.RESULTS AvrRxo1 is required for Xocto reopen the stomata of rice Although the avrRxo1 gene was cloned in 2004 ( Zhao et al., 2004 ), understanding of the virulence function of AvrRxo1 in the compatible Xoc–rice interaction is limited, partly because of the lack of an available avrRxo1 knockout mutant.
We successfully generated an avrRxo1 knockout mutant designated RS105 Da (Supplemental Figure 1 ) and evaluated its virulence in Zhonghua11, a japonica-type rice cultivar that is susceptible toRS105. The RS105 Damutant caused smaller lesions and showed lower multiplication than both wild-type RS105 and the avrRxo1 - complementary strain when bacteria were dip inoculated ontothe leaf surface ( Figure 1 A and 1B).However, when bacteria were inﬁltrated directly into the apoplast, the RS105 Damutant showed similar multiplication to the wild-type and avrRxo1 -com- plementary strains ( Figure 1 C and Supplemental Figure 2 ).ThisB A CD Figure 1.AvrRxo1 promotes Xocinfection in rice.(A) Disease symptoms in the leaves of the wild-type rice cultivar Zhonghua11 14 days after dip inocu-lation (dpi) with RS105 ( Xocstrain RS105), RS105 Da (avrRxo1 knockout mutant), or RS105 Da-CP (com- plementary strain).Scale bar represents 0.5 cm.

At 1 h post treatment (hpt),the average stomatal aperture on inoculated leaves was signiﬁ- cantly smaller than that on water-treated leaves ( Figure 1 D). At 8 hpt, the stomatal aperture of leaves inoculated with wild-typeRS105 or the avrRxo1 -complementary strain had reverted to the pre-inoculation state.Interestingly, stomatal reopening was not observed in leaves incubated with the RS105 Damutant (Figure 1 D).These results suggest that AvrRxo1 participates in stomatal reopening in rice.AvrRxo1 targets the OsPDX1.2 protein in rice To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which AvrRxo1 pro-motes Xoc infection in rice leaves, we performed yeast two- hybrid screening using AvrRxo1 (109–421 amino acid fragments) as bait and a rice cDNA library as prey.We screened ﬁve proteins that interacted with AvrRxo1 ( Supplemental Table 3 ), among which OsPDX1.2 ( Os10G01080 ) showed the strongest interaction ( Figure 2 A).
OsPDX1.2 shares high sequence homology with the Arabidopsis pyridoxine synthase gene AtPDX1.3 (At5G01410 ), which is associated with the production of VB6 ( Titiz et al., 2006 ). To conﬁrm whether full-length OsPDX1.2 and AvrRxo1 interact in vivo , we performed a bimolec- ular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and a coimmu-noprecipitation (coIP) assay via the transient co-expression of AvrRxo1-MYC-nYFP (N-terminal fragment of yellow ﬂuorescent protein) and OsPDX1.2-hemagglutinin (HA)-cYFP (C-terminalfragment of yellow ﬂuorescent protein) in the leaves of N.benthamiana.The yellow ﬂuorescence signal was observed only at the border of the epidermal cells ( Figure 2 B), suggesting that AvrRxo1 interacts with OsPDX1.2 in plants.The coIP assayresults showed that MYC-epitope-tagged AvrRxo1 was coimmu- noprecipitated with HA-epitope-tagged OsPDX1.2 ( Figure 2 C).

(legend continued on next page) Plant Communications 3, 100324, May 9 2022 ª2022 The Author(s). 3AvrRxo1 inhibits vitamin B6 biosynthesis, promoting infection in rice Plant Communications Deletion analysis indicated that the C termini of AvrRxo1 and PDX1.2 were sufﬁcient for the observed interaction(Supplemental Figure 3 ).In rice, two other PDX1 proteins, OsPDX1.1 ( Os07G01020 ) and OsPDX1.3 ( Os11G48080 ), share high sequence homology with OsPDX1.2 (93% and 85% identity at the amino acid level, respectively).Both OsPDX1.1and OsPDX1.3 interact with AvrRxo1 in yeast and plant cells (Supplemental Figure 4 ).Because previous crystallization studies showed that PDX1 proteins from Bacillus subtilis form a synthase complex ( Mooney et al., 2009 ), we analyzed the interactions among PDX1 proteins and found that PDX1 proteins from rice can assemble into homo- and heterodimers(Supplemental Figure 5 ).
We also tested the interaction of AvrRxo1 with PDX1 proteins from the nonhost plant Arabidopsis and with SNZ1, a homolog involved in pyridoxine biosynthesis from yeast. All three PDX1 proteins (AtPDX1.1, AtPDX1.2, andAtPDX1.3) of Arabidopsis and SNZ1 of yeast interacted with AvrRxo1 ( Supplemental Figure 6 ).Together, these data suggest that interaction with AvrRxo1 is a common feature of the PDX1protein family that is conserved in rice (a monocot), Arabidopsis (a dicot), and yeast (a fungus), consistent with previous observa- tions of the common toxic activity of AvrRxo1 in several plantsand yeasts ( Liu et al., 2014 ;Triplett et al., 2016 ).AvrRxo1 targets and degrades OsPDX1.2 protein in rice The AvrRxo1 protein is predicted to contain a protease motif (Zhao et al., 2004 ), which may affect the stability of PDX1 proteins.We therefore monitored the levels of the OsPDX1.2 protein in rice after Xoc infection.
Compared with control rice plants treated with H 2O, the leaves of rice plants sprayed with RS105 or the complementary strain RS105 Da-CP showed a signiﬁcantly decreased level of the OsPDX1.2 protein(Figure 2 D). By contrast, rice leaves treated with RS105 Da showed a similar level of OsPDX1.2 to that observed in the H 2O- treated control.These results showed that AvrRxo1 is requiredforXoc to decrease the level of OsPDX1.2 during infection.We also examined the levels of AtPDX1 proteins in dexamethasone- inducible, avrRxo1 -expressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Col-0 genetic background).The dexamethasone-inducedexpression of AvrRxo1 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the AtPDX1 protein level at 24 hpt ( Supplemental Figure 7 ).The reduction in OsPDX1.2 and AtPDX1 levels in an AvrRxo1- dependent manner observed in vivo raised the possibility that AvrRxo1 may directly act as a protease on PDX1 proteins.
Totest this hypothesis, we performed enzyme catalysis assays us- ing puriﬁed AvrRxo1 and OsPDX1.2 proteins and detected the degradation of OsPDX1.2 within 15 min upon AvrRxo1 addition.With increased reaction times, more OsPDX1.2 was degraded(Figure 2 E). In addition to the presence of a putative protease domain, AvrRxo1 contains a putative ATP-binding motif ( Zhao et al., 2004 ), raising the possibility that AvrRxo1 may be an ATP-dependent protease.We therefore carried out a protein degradation assay in the presence of different concentrations of ATP.In reactions containing 1 or 10 mM ATP, OsPDX1.2 pro-teins were degraded by AvrRxo1, whereas in reactions contain- ing less than 0.1 mM ATP, AvrRxo1 failed to degrade OsPDX1.2 (Figure 2 F).We also generated AvrRxo1K166N and AvrR- xo1T167A, which harbored mutations in the ATP-binding motif, and examined their protease activity.We found that the AvrRxo1K166N and AvrRxo1T167A mutants failed to degradeOsPDX1.2 ( Figure 2 G).
These results indicate that ATP is required for AvrRxo1 to degrade OsPDX1.2 proteins. In addition, we examined the protease activity of the AvrRxo1D193A mutant, with a mutation at the putative kinase catalytic aspartic acid res-idue D193 ( Han et al., 2015 ;Shidore et al., 2017 ).We observed that AvrRxo1D193A could still degrade OsPDX1.2 proteins (Figure 2 G), suggesting that this putative kinase activity is not required for the protease activity of AvrRxo1.The results above reveal that AvrRxo1 targets and degrades OsPDX1.2 protein in rice infected by Xoc.AvrRxo1 decreases the level of VB6 in leaves and seeds of rice Because OsPDX1.1 and OsPDX1.2 are involved in VB6 biosyn- thesis in rice ( Chen et al., 2014 ), we next investigated whether AvrRxo1 modulates the level of VB6 during Xoc infection by examining rice leaves inoculated with the RS105 or RS105 Da strain.
Compared with plants subjected to the control (H 2O) treat- ment, plants inoculated with RS105 showed signiﬁcantly lowerVB6 levels in their leaves ( Figure 2 H). Interestingly, the VB6 levels of RS105 Damutant-inoculated plants were signiﬁcantly higher than those of RS105-inoculated plants but were lower than those of control-treated plants ( Figure 2 H), suggesting that AvrRxo1 is likely to be one of the virulence factors involved in reducing VB6 levels.We also examined the levels of VB6 in rice seeds after RS105 or RS105 Dainoculation.A lower level of VB6 was observed in the seeds of rice inoculated with RS105 than in those of the control ( Figure 2 H), suggesting that Xoc invasion could decrease the nutritional content of rice.OsPDX1 and VB6 positively regulate rice immunity to Xoc Our results obtained thus far suggested that, during Xocinvasion, AvrRxo1 targets OsPDX1 proteins to inhibit the synthesis of VB6.
VB6 has been shown to play important roles in plant growth, devel-opment, and abiotic stress responses ( Mooney et al., 2009 ), and it (D)Xoc inoculation decreased OsPDX1.2 protein levels in rice plants. Total proteins were from wild-type Zhonghua11 inoculated with H 2O, RS105, or RS105 Da(avrRxo1 knockout mutant) at 14 dpi.Proteins were analyzed using western blotting with an anti-OsPDX1 antibody (top panel), and overall protein loading was visualized by Coomassie blue staining (bottom panel).(E) AvrRxo1 degrades the OsPDX1.2 protein.The AvrRxo1 and OsPDX1.2 proteins were incubated in reaction buffer for the indicated times.OsPDX1.2proteins were visualized by western blotting with an anti-OsPDX1 antibody.(F) ATP is required for AvrRxo1-mediated OsPDX1.2 degradation.The OsPDX1.2 and AvrRxo1 proteins were incubated in reaction buffer containing different concentrations of ATP (0–10 mM).Two hours later, OsPDX1.2 proteins were analyzed as indicated in (E).

The transgenic lines showed signiﬁcantly reduced transcriptlevels of OsPDX1.1 ,OsPDX1.2 ,a n d OsPDX1.3 ,a sd e t e c t e db yR T – PCR ( Supplemental Figure 8 ). When OsPDX1 -RNAi transgenic plants were inoculated with RS105, we observed larger bacterialpopulations than in wild-type control plants ( Figure 3 A).Next, we produced transgenic rice lines overexpressing the OsPDX1.2 gene in Zhonghua11 ( Supplemental Figure 8 ).The transgenic lines showed greater resistance to Xoc than did the wild type (Figure 3 B).Transgenic lines constitutively expressing the OsPDX1.1 orOsPDX1.3 gene also showed enhanced resistance to RS105 infection ( Supplemental Figure 9 ).VB6 levels were 20%–30% lower in OsPDX1 -RNAi lines and 25%–95% higher in OsPDX1.2 -overexpressing (OE) lines ( Figure 3 C) than in wild-type Zhonghua11 plants.
To further conﬁrm the function of OsPDX1.2 , two OsPDX1.2 knockout mutants were generated via the CRISPR–Cas9 system ( Supplemental Figure 10 ) and were observed to have lower VB6 levels ( Figure 3 C) and to show increased susceptibility to Xoc multiplication ( Figure 3 D). Furthermore, a decrease in the bacterial population was observed in the leaves of rice plants pretreated with VB6, suggesting thatVB6 enhanced rice defense against Xoc.Because AvrRxo1 plays a key role in defeating stomatal immunity, we further examined the stomatal apertures of OsPDX 1.2-OE and OsPDX1.2 -knockout (KO) lines.We observed that the average stomatal apertures weresigniﬁcantly smaller on OsPDX1.2 -OE lines and signiﬁcantly larger onOsPDX1.2 -KO lines compared with the wild-type lines (Figure 3 F), consistent with the positive anti- Xocroles of OsPDX1.2.Taken together, these results suggest that OsPDX1 and VB6 posi- tively regulate rice stomatal immunity to Xoc.
VB6 is dependent on ABA biosynthesis and signaling to promote stomatal closure ABA plays an essential role in stomatal immunity ( Lim and Lee, 2015 ;Su et al., 2017 ), and the positive regulation of rice stomatal immunity to Xoc by VB6 encouraged us to examine the relationship between ABA and VB6. Relative to the wildtype, the OsPDX1.2 -KO mutants exhibited lower levels of ABA, whereas the OsPDX1.2 -OE transgenic lines presented higher levels of ABA ( Figure 4 A and 4B), suggesting that OsPDX1 and VB6 are associated with the ABA-metabolism-mediated regula- tion of rice immunity to Xoc.Because the virulence function of AvrRxo1 during infection is linked to stomatal reopening, we investigated whether VB6-mediated ABA metabolism may play a role in modulating stomatal immunity.To directly test this possibility, we examined the stomatal aperturein rice leaves treated with VB6.
We found that VB6 treatment caused the stomata to close in both rice ( Figure 4 C) and Arabidopsis (Supplemental Figure 11 ). Interestingly, VB6-induced stomatal closure is dependent on ABA biosynthesis and signaling.Speciﬁcally, compared with the results observed in wild-type rice plants, stomatal responses to VB6 or ABA were greatly compro-mised in the leaves of the ABA-insensitive mutant osbzip23 (Figure 4 C).In Arabidopsis , the VB6-triggered stomatal responses of the ABA biosynthetic mutant aba2-1 and the ABA-signaling mutant abi1-1 were compromised ( Supplemental Figure 11 ).VB6 acts as a cofactor of numerous enzymes, such as those catalyzing the metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids(Mooney et al., 2009 ).We suspected that VB6 might promote the biosynthesis of ABA in plants.To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of ABA in plants treated with VB6.
The high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC)–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS assay showed that the level of ABA was greatly increased after VB6 treatment (Figure 4 D). VB6-activated ABA biosynthesis could also be visu- alized via an immunohistochemistry assay using an ABA-speciﬁc antibody.Enhanced immunoﬂuorescence was detected in guard cells of rice leaves treated with VB6 ( Figure 4 E).Similarly, VB6 was found to promote ABA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis leaves (Supplemental Figure 12 ).These results strongly suggest that VB6 activates ABA biosynthesis as a mechanism to promote stomatal closure.Because Xoc invasion reduces the level of VB6 ( Figure 2 H) and VB6 activates ABA biosynthesis ( Figure 4 D and 4E), we hypothesized that Xoc invasion leads to a reduction in ABA levels as a virulence strategy.
To test this hypothesis, we quantiﬁed ABA concentrations in rice plants inoculated withthe RS105, RS105 Da, or RS105 Da-complemented bacterial suspension .The results of both the HPLC–MS/MS assay (Figure 4 F) and the immunohistochemistry assay ( Figure 4 G and Supplemental Figure 13 ) showed that the levels of ABA in the leaves of rice infected with RS105 or RS105 Da-complemented strains were signiﬁcantly lower than those in H 2O-treated and RS105 Da-inoculated plants. VB6 is required as a cofactor for the biosynthesis of ABA We next investigated how VB6 promotes ABA biosynthesis.VB6 is required for the activation of molybdenum cofactor(Moco) by Moco sulfurtransferase ( Seo et al., 2000a ).In plants, aldehyde oxidase 3 (AO3) requires activated Moco to catalyze the oxidation of abscisic aldehyde to generate ABA(Seo et al., 2000b ;Bittner et al., 2001 ).
We therefore tested the activity of aldehyde oxidase in OsPDX1.2 -OE transgenic plants and OsPDX1 - K Op l a n t sb yn a t i v ep o l y a c r y l a m i d eg e l electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 4 H, a signiﬁcant decrease in AO3 activity was detected in the leaves of OsPDX1 -KO plants, whereas in OsPDX1.2 -OE transgenic plants, AO3 exhibited an intense band corresponding toABA–aldehyde.We also detected a marked reduction in aldehyde oxidase activity in Xoc-inoculated plants ( Figure 4 I).Taken together, these results suggest that VB6 is required foraldehyde oxidase activity in ABA biosynthesis in plants.ABA positively regulates rice immunity to Xoc Because VB6 is required for ABA biosynthesis and positively regulates the stomatal immunity of rice against Xoc,w e tested whether ABA affects rice defense against Xoc.W e found that ABA treatment signiﬁcantly reduced bacterial multi-plication in the leaves of rice ( Figure 5 A).
Conversely, the ABA-deﬁcient mutant osaba1 and the ABA-insensitive mutant bzip23 showed signiﬁcantly increased susceptibility to Xoc multiplication ( Figure 5 B and 5C). In addition, transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsABA3 were generated and showed enhanced resistance to Xoc (Figure 5 D).These results suggest that ABA also positively regulates rice immunity to Xoc.Plant Communications 3, 100324, May 9 2022 ª2022 The Author(s).5AvrRxo1 inhibits vitamin B6 biosynthesis, promoting infection in rice Plant Communications OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2FAB D CE OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2OsPDX1.2 OsPDX1.2 Figure 3.OsPDX1 and VB6 positively regulate rice stomatal immunity against Xoc.(A) The populations of Xocstrain RS105 in the leaves of wild-type Zhonghua11 rice or OsPDX1-RNAi T1 generation transgenic plants.Bacterial growth was assessed at 14 dpi (n R6; **P%0.01; Student’s t-test).

7AvrRxo1 inhibits vitamin B6 biosynthesis, promoting infection in rice Plant Communications DISCUSSION In this research, we found that AvrRxo1 targets and degrades OsPDX1.2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of VB6, leadingto a decreased ABA level and the reopening of closed stomata (Figure 6 ). Previous studies showed that AvrRxo1 can phosphor- ylate NAD to generate 3 ʹ-NADP in bacteria, yeast, and plants (Schuebel et al., 2016 ;Triplett et al., 2016 ;Shidore et al., 2017 ).However, this activity could not clearly explain the virulence function of AvrRxo1 revealed in our avrRxo1 mutant analysis.For example, reduced NAD is expected to increase ABA sensi- tivity ( Hong et al., 2020 ), which conﬂicts with the role of ABA in regulating stomatal closure.In addition, a previous studyshowed that NAD kinase activity is not always associated withthe toxicity of AvrRxo1 or the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by AvrRxo1 ( Shidore et al., 2017 ).
AvrRxo1- mediated NAD phosphorylation to produce 3 ʹ-NADP may play some role in AvrRxo1 toxicity, but protease activity is required for its virulence function in the context of Xoc infection in rice leaves, as demonstrated in this study. ABA plays complex roles in the regulation of plant–microbe inter- actions ( Lievens et al., 2017 ).As a key regulator of stomatal closure, ABA positively regulates immunity to pathogens thatenter host plants mainly through the stomata, but some reports have found that ABA enhances plant susceptibility to certain pathogens ( Liao et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al., 2019 ).InArabidopsis , the ABA-deﬁcient aba3-1 mutant exhibits compromised microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)- and bacterium- induced stomatal closure ( Melotto et al., 2006 ).Similarly, Pst DC3000 does not induce stomatal closure in the notabilis tomato mutant, which lacks the ABA synthesis gene NCED 1 (Du et al., 2014 ).
OPEN STOMATA1 is one of the core signaling components of the ABA pathway, and the ost1-2 mutant is defec- tive in MAMP- and bacterium-induced stomatal closure ( Melotto et al., 2006 ). However, some studies have shown that chitosan and the yeast elicitor YEL are able to induce stomatal closure intheaba2-2 mutant and ABA-biosynthesis-inhibitor-treated plants (Issak et al., 2013 ).It has also been reported that the ABA- independent oxylipin pathway controls stomatal closure and im-mune defense in Arabidopsis (Montillet et al., 2013 ).In addition, a recent study demonstrated that ﬂg22-induced stomatal closure was associated with the phosphorylation of OSCA1.3, a Ca 2+- permeable channel that does not regulate stomatal closureupon the perception of ABA ( Thor et al., 2020 ).These results suggest that both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent path- ways play roles in stomatal defense.
In this work, we found thatVB6 induces stomatal closure by promoting the biosynthesis of ABA and that ABA biosynthesis and signaling are required for VB6-induced stomatal closure ( Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 11 ). VB6 acts as a cofactor of ABA3, which can convertMoco from the desulfo-form into the sulfo-form.The sulfo-form of Moco is required for aldehyde oxidase AAO3 to catalyze thetransformation of abscisic aldehyde to ABA ( Seo et al., 2000b ; Bittner et al., 2001 ).Thus, the AvrRxo1-mediated inhibition of VB6 biosynthesis revealed a previously unknown step in ABA biosynthesis in plants, in addition to illuminating a novel mecha-nism of stomatal immunity suppression by a pathogen.In plants, stomatal closure to prevent bacteria from entering leaves has emerged as a conserved mechanism in the activation of innate immunity.
Stomatal defense was ﬁrst discovered while studying the Arabidopsis–Pst DC3000 interaction and was sub- sequently found in other plants, such as tomato and tobacco(Du et al., 2014 ;Murray et al., 2016 ). Until now, however, little has been known about whether monocots also employ stomatal defense against pathogenic bacteria.Our results showthat Xoc invasion induces rapid stomatal closure within 1 h(Figure 1 D), suggesting that stomatal defense is also involved in rice–bacteria interactions.To counteract stomatal immunity,other bacteria secrete phytotoxins or T3SS effectors to overcome stomatal defense ( Melotto et al., 2017 ).
In Arabidopsis , some PstDC3000 effectors, such as HopF2, reduce the MAMP-triggered ROS burst to inhibit stomatal closure; other effectors, such as HopX1, HopZ1, AvrB, and the phytotoxin COR, induce jasmonic acid signaling, and the proteasome inhibitor sy-ringolin A suppresses the salicylic acid (SA) response to inhibitstomatal defense ( Schellenberg et al., 2010 ;Xin and He, 2013 ; Zheng et al., 2015 ;Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2017 ). Recently, it was reported that the T3SS effector XopC2 of Xoc, as a protein kinase, phosphorylates the key component of SCFOsCOI1b to promote JAZ degradation and jasmonic acid signaling, which re- sults in stomatal reopening ( Wang et al., 2021 ).Here, we identiﬁed the VB6 biosynthesis gene OsPDX1.2 as a new target of bacterial effectors to overcome stomatal defense.Notably, in addition to its presence in all Xoc strains, avrRxo1 is widely conserved in other bacterial pathogens, such as Acidovorax and Burkholderia , which infect diverse plants.
It remains to be determined whether AvrRxo1 targets PDX1 proteins in these plant–pathogen interactions as a widespread mechanism facili-tating bacterial invasion. PDX1 is the major gene of de novo VB6 biosynthesis that cata- lyzes more than 400 enzymes and plays an essential role in plant growth and development ( Titiz et al., 2006 ).Because of its capacity to quench ROS, VB6 has also been found to regulateplant response to biotic and abiotic stresses.The expression of Arabidopsis PDX1 genes is regulated by abiotic stresses like high light, drought, chilling, ozone, and UV radiation ( Denslow et al., 2007 ), and the Arabidopsis pdx1.3 mutant is hypersensitive to salt and UV-B treatments (Titiz et al., 2010).In (F) ABA levels in the leaves of wild-type Zhonghua11 plants dip inoculated with RS105, RS105 Da, or RS105 Da-CP (mean ±SD;n=3 ;* * P%0.01; Student’s t-test).Leaves were harvested at 14 dpi.

Aldehyde oxidase activity was examined as indicated in (H). 8 Plant Communications 3, 100324, May 9 2022 ª2022 The Author(s).Plant Communications AvrRxo1 inhibits vitamin B6 biosynthesis, promoting infection in rice another study of its ROS quenching capacity, excess VB6 in- hibited hypersensitive cell death and delayed the defenseresponse to an ROS-dependent pathogen in tobacco ( Denslow et al., 2005 ).It is noteworthy that the pdx3 and sos4 mutants, which are involved in the VB6 salvage pathway, showed higherlevels of VB6 and hypersensitivity to salt stress ( Titiz et al., 2006 ;Colinas et al., 2016 ).Especially in the pdx3 mutant, there is an increased level of SA and upregulated expression ofdefense genes, suggesting that VB6 may act as a cofactor during SA synthesis in plants.Further studies are needed to clarify the association between VB6 and SA synthesis.
METHODS Bacterial strains and plasmid construction The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Supplemental Table 1 . The Escherichia coli strains were cultured on Luria-Bertani medium at 37/C14C.The Xoc RS105 strain was cultured on nutrient agar (NA) medium containing 50 mgm l/C01rifampicin at 28/C14C.The Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato strain DC3000 was cultured on King’s B medium containing 50 mgm l/C01rifampicin at 28/C14C.The Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains were cultured on Luria-Bertani medium containing 50mgm l/C01rifampicin at 28/C14C.To generate the avrRxo1 KO mutant, a 430-bp fragment located 88–517 bp downstream of the ATG start codon was ampliﬁed using the primersavrRxo1KO-F and avrRxo1KO-R.The fragment was inserted into the pEASY-T1 vector (TransGen, China), the construct was transformed into RS105 by electrotransformation, and the strain was cultured on NA me-dium containing 50 mgm l /C01rifampicin and 50 mgm l/C01kanamycin at 28/C14C.
To generate pHM1-avrRxo1, the avrRxo1 gene with its promoter was ampliﬁed using the primers AvrRxo1-ORF1-F and AvrRxo1-ORF2-R, which contained SacI sequences at both the 5 ʹand 3 ʹends, followed by Sac I digestion and ligation into the pHM1 vector ( Yang et al., 2006 ). pHM1-avrRxo1 was transformed into RS105 Da(avrRxo1 KO mutant) by electrotransformation and cultured on NA medium containing 50 mgm l/C01 rifampicin, 50 mgm l/C01spectinomycin, and 50 mgm l/C01kanamycin at 28/C14C.In a yeast two-hybrid system, avrRxo1(109–421), avrRxo1(160–421), avrRxo1(164–421), avrRxo1(194–421), avrRxo1(230–421), avrRxo1(309–421), avrRxo1(364–421), avrRxo1(1–411), OsPDX1.1, OsPDX1.3, OsPDX1.2(1–313), OsPDX1.2(157–313), OsPDX1.2(184–313), OsPDX1.2(199–313), OsPDX1.2(246–313), OsPDX1.2(1–283), OsPDX1.2(1–273),OsPDX1.2(1–263), and OsPDX1.2(1–253) were ampliﬁed using the primerscontaining Nco Ia n d BamH I sites listed in Supplemental Table 2 and inserted into the pGBKT7 or pGADT7 (Clontech) vector.
The plasmids were transformed into Y2H Gold cells and plated on double dropoutmedium (SD-Leu/-Trp) and quadruple dropout medium (SD-His/-Leu/-Trp/-Ura) (Clontech). For BiFC and coIP assays, the AvrRxo1 and OsPDX1.2 genes were ampli- ﬁed by PCR using primers containing BamH Ia n d Hind III sites, and theprod- ucts were cloned into the pSPYNE and pSPYCE vectors ( Walter et al., 2004 ), respectively.OsPDX1.1-cYFP and OsPDX1.3-cYFP were generated using a similar method.The primers used to amplify avrRxo1, OsPDX1.1, OsPDX1.2, and OsPDX1.3 are described in Supplemental Table 2 .AvrRxo1 fused with MBP and 6 3His tag was used for Escherichia coli fusion protein isolation.The AvrRxo1 gene was ampliﬁed using primerscontaining BamH I at the 5 ʹend and Hind III at the 3 ʹend, followed by BamH I and Hind III digestion and ligation into the pMal-c2x vector (NEB).
The AvrRxo1 point mutants AvrRxo1 K166N, AvrRxo1T167A, and AvrRxo1D193Awere generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 using the pMal-c2x-AvrRxo1 construct as the template. The OsPDX1.2 gene was cloned into the pDONR201 entry vector via the BP reaction and then subcloned into thepET-DEST42 vector (Invitrogen).These constructs were transformedintoE.coli strain BL-21 by electrotransformation.The plasmids P ubi:OsPDX1.1, P ubi:OsPDX1.2, P ubi:OsPDX1.3, and P ubi: OsABA3 were constructed by introducing the full-length OsPDX1.1, OsPDX1.2, OsPDX1.3, and OsABA3 sequences into the Xcm I-digested plasmid pCXUN-HA ( Chen et al., 2009 ).cDNA from Zhonghua11 was used as a template to amplify these fragments.To silence OsPDX1.2 in rice, a 263-bp fragment located at the 3 ʹend of the OsPDX1.2 gene was ampliﬁed using Zhonghua11 genomic DNA as abzip23 osaba1 OsABA3AB C D Figure 5.ABA positively regulates rice immunity to Xoc.

Plant material and growth conditions Rice ( Oryza sativa japonica) plants of the wild-type Zhonghua11 and Nip- ponbare; the bzip23 (Zhonghua11 background; Xiang et al., 2008 ),osaba1 (Nipponbare background), and OsPDX1.2 -KO mutants; and the OsPDX1.2 -OX, OsPDX1.2 -RNAi, and OsABA3 -OX transgenic lines were grown in soil in a growth house with 12-h days (at 28/C14C and 60%–75% relative humidity) and 12-h nights (at 24/C14C and 60%–75% relative humidity). Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0, Ler, aba2-1 (Schwartz et al., 1997 ), abi1-1 (Leung et al., 1994 ), and transgenic lines containing DEX: avrRxo1 were grown in nutrient substrates in an incubator with 12-h days (at 22/C14C and 60%–75% relative humidity) and 12-h nights (at 20/C14C and 60%–75% relative humidity).N.benthamiana plants were grown in a greenhouse with 12-h days (at 22/C14C and 60%–75% relative humidity) and 12-h nights (at 20/C14C and 60%–75% relative humidity).
Rice and Arabidopsis transformation Transgenic rice plants were constructed via Agrobacterium -mediated transformation according to published protocols ( Lin and Zhang, 2005 ).Agrobacterium -mediated Arabidopsis transformation was performed by ﬂoral dipping as described previously ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). The OsPDX1 KO mutants OsPDX1.2-KO1 and OsPDX1.2-KO2 were generated using the CRISPR–Cas9 system ( Ma et al., 2016 ).The primers used to sequence the target OsPDX1 are listed in Supplemental Table 2.Chemical treatments To study the effects of VB6 or ABA on disease development, VB6 (Sigma- Aldrich) or ABA (Sigma-Aldrich) solubilized in deionized H 2O supple- mented with 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 or ddH 2O (as a control) was sprayed on rice plants, and 4 h later, the rice plants were sprayed withbacterial suspensions (10 8colony-forming units [CFU] ml/C01).The plants were sprayed with VB6, ABA, or ddH 2O again at 4 and 8 days after inoc- ulation.
Bacterial growth was measured at 14 days after inoculation. Xocinfection and bacterial growth assay To evaluate bacterial leaf streak disease, 4-week-old rice plants were inoc- ulated with bacterial suspensions (108CFU ml/C01) by spray or inﬁltration.For the spray assay, the rice was completely sprayed with the bacterial suspen- sion in buffer containing 10 mM MgCl 2supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20.For the inﬁltration assay, the bacterial suspension in buffer con-taining 10 mM MgCl 2was inﬁltrated into rice leaves with a needleless sy- ringe.Bacterial growth was measured at 14 days after inoculation.To analyze the effects of Xoc infection on the VB6 level in seeds, rice plants at the bolting stage were completely sprayed with bacterial suspen- sion in buffer containing 10 mM MgCl 2supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20.The seeds were harvested after ripening, and VB6 quantitation was performed.A bacterial growth assay was performed in rice plants at 14 days after inoculation.

The samples were ground in 2 ml of sterile distilled water followed by serial dilution (1:10) and plating on NA medium containing 50 mgm l/C01rifampicin at 28/C14C for colony count- ing. The experiment was repeated three times.The means were comparedusing Student’s t-test.The standard error and t-test results were recorded.Stomatal aperture measurement The stomatal apertures on the leaves of rice or Arabidopsis plants were measured as reported by Melotto et al.(2006) .Rice or Arabidopsis plants were kept under light for at least 3 h and then treated with VB6 or ABA or inoculated with Xoc strains.Leaves were harvested at 1 and 8 h after treatment.The stomatal apertures were measured using an LSM880 NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss).RNA extraction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and quantitative real-time PCR Leaves or whole plants were collected to extract total RNA using the TRI- zol Reagent (Invitrogen).
ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (TOYOBO) and 1 mg of total RNA were used to synthesize ﬁrst-strand cDNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantita-tive real-time PCR was performed with a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-TimePCR System (Life Technologies) using KOD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.The primers used for quantitative real-time PCR are described in Supplemental Table 2 .Protein interaction analysis Y2H assays were used to screen protein interactions with the Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System (Clontech) as described in the manufac- turer’s instructions.In brief, the plasmids pGBKT7-avrRxo1(109–421)and pGADT7-OsPDX1.2 were transformed into Y2H Gold yeast cells,which were then grown on double dropout medium (SD-Leu/-Trp) and quadruple dropout medium (SD-His/-Leu/-Trp/-Ura).BiFC was used to examine the protein interactions as described previously (Walter et al., 2004 ).
In brief, Agrobacterium GV3101 cells containing the AvrRxo1-MYC-nYFP and OsPDX1.2-HA-cYFP plasmids were resus- pended in agroinﬁltration buffer (10 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid [MES], pH 5.6, 200 mM acetosyringone), and the opti-cal density at 600 nm was adjusted to 1.0. These suspensions were mixedin equal amounts and inﬁltrated into 4-week-old N.benthamiana leaves with a needleless syringe.Three days later, the leaves were observed using an LSM 880 NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss).A coIP assay was performed to examine protein interactions as described previously ( Moffett et al., 2002 ).
In brief, the agroinﬁltrated tobacco leaves were harvested and ground to a ﬁne powder in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was resuspended in protein extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM glucose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mMdithiothreitol, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3VO4,2 5m M b-sodium glycerophos- phate, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 3protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma]) for 1 h. MYC-Trap beads were used to immunoprecipitate the proteins, and the eluted proteins were further analyzed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting.An anti-OsPDX1 antibody raised against DDAHHINKHN epitope peptides was produced by Abmart and used at a 1:1000 dilution.The anti-c-Myc tag antibody was used against c-Myc-tagged protein (1:3000; Abmart).The secondary antibody used was horseradish-peroxidase-conjugatedgoat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Sigma; 1:10 000).
Protein puriﬁcation and degradation analyses The MBP-AvrRxo1-6 3His and OsPDX1.2-6 3His proteins were puriﬁed by Ni2+afﬁnity chromatography using cOmplete His-Tag Puriﬁcation Resin (Roche). Protein concentrations were measured with a NanoDrop spec- trophotometer and via SDS–PAGE.The puriﬁed MBP-AvrRxo1-6 3His protein (1 mg) and OsPDX1.2-6 3His proteins (5 mg) were mixed in reactionbuffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM ATP) and incubated at 37/C14C for 2 h.The interaction products were further analyzed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting.Quantitation of VB6 VB6 was extracted and quantitated as described previously ( Wagner et al., 2006 ).In brief, leaves from 4-week-old rice plants and ripe seeds were powdered in liquid nitrogen, suspended in 0.1 M HCl, and boiledfor 30 min at 120 /C14C.The extracts were treated with acid phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) and b-glucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich).
The contents of pyri- doxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine were determined via HPLC using sol-vents A (0.1% acetic acid) and B (acetonitrile). Pyridoxine-hydrochloride, pyridoxal-hydrochloride, and PM dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) served as standards.Quantitation of ABA levels The leaves of 4-week-old seedlings were used for ABA quantiﬁcation.Toexamine the effects of Xoc invasion on the level of ABA, rice seedlings were dip inoculated with RS105, RS105 Da(avrRxo1 KO mutant), or RS105 Da-CP (the complementary strain).To examine the effects of VB6 on the level of ABA, leaves of 4-week-old seedlings were treated withVB6 (100 mM) or ddH 2O by injection.Samples of 100 mg each were pre- pared and quantiﬁed using an HPLC–MS/MS system as reported previ- ously ( Xu et al., 2016 ).At least three biological replicates were analyzed.ABA was also detected using immunocytochemistry in the leaves of riceandArabidopsis as reported elsewhere ( Ondzighi-Assoume et al., 2016 ).
In brief, the leaves were soaked in buffer, vacuum inﬁltrated at 4 /C14C, and then incubated at 4/C14C overnight with shaking. Thereafter, the samples were hyalinized and incubated with an anti-ABA polyclonal antibody (Invi-trogen).Next, the samples were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit immuno- globulin G secondary antibody (Invitrogen).The resulting ﬂuorescence sig- nals were measured using an LSM 880 NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss).Aldehyde oxidase activity assay Aldehyde oxidase activity was analyzed as reported previously ( Seo et al., 2000a ).Rice leaves were ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen and suspended in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 1mM sodium molybdate, 10 mM ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide, 2 mM dithiothreitol) to extract total proteins, which were then subjected tonative PAGE.The bands corresponding to abscisic aldehyde activitywere developed with abscisic aldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) at 30 /C14C in the dark for 30 min.
