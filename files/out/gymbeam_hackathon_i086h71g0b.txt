As well as suppressing bone resorption, Martin and Seeman make the point that, since osteo - clasts initiate bone remodelling, antiresorptives suppress this renewal process. This means they reduce both bone resorption and formation, due to the coupling signals by which os - teoclasts recruit osteoblast precursors to the bone remodelling unit,2 and therefore only slow bone loss.They point out that for this reason, a common approach to osteoporosis therapy is to start by building bone with an anabolic agent, such as teriparatide, abalopara - tide, or romosozumab.
Teriparatide and abaloparatide are similar because they are based on the highly-similar N-terminal regions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein.3 They both build bone by stimulating bone remodelling activity, and by overfilling the resorbed space, equivalent to increasing modeling at a microscopic level.4 Although they stimulate remod - elling and must therefore stimulate osteoclasts, Martin and Seeman suggest the anabolic ef - fect results mainly from direct actions on the osteoblast lineage. This includes their action to inhibit sclerostin, a Wnt pathway inhibitor which acts as a brake on bone formation.
The third anabolic agent available, romosozumab, is an antibody to sclerostin so also releases Neurospine eISSN 2586-6591 pISSN 2586-6583 This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecom - mons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Since ageing will continue to affect the skeleton, osteoporosis therapy needs to be long term, and probably life-long. This also needs to be considered when antiresorptive therapies are ceased.Temporary “drug holidays” may be feasible for patients who have been on bisphosphonates since these remain in the system and would continue to suppress bone remodelling.In contrast, the antiresorptive benefit of denosumab, which is quickly cleared, is quickly lost.6 To prevent continuing bone loss, cessation of denosumab should be followed as soon as practical with an al - ternative antiresorptive approach such as a bisphosphonate.Those considering how best to commence, and continue, ther - apies for osteoporosis will be aided by understanding how each therapy influences the cells within the skeleton and the ways they interact, and the information in the review provides a helpful perspective.• Conflict of Interest: The author has nothing to disclose.REFERENCES 1.Martin TJ, Seeman E.
