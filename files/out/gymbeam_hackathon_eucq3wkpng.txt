Material and methods: The rats were assigned to four groups: Control (2 ml saline for 5 days), MTX (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) only on the initial day of the study), MTX + vitamin E (20 mg/kg MTX (i.p.) only on the first day, and 100 mg/kg vitamin E (i.p.) was applied for 5 days during the study), Vitamin E (100 mg/kg of vitamin E (i.p.) was given for five days). Histopathologic changes and the flow cytometric apoptotic index were evaluated for liver tissue.The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparisons between groups.The statistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05.Results: In the histopathological analysis, hepatocyte degeneration, dilatation of sinusoids, mononuclear cell infiltration, hydropic degeneration in hepatocytes, vacuolization, and pycnotic nucleus were observed in the MTX group.In the MTX + vitamin E group, hepatocyte degeneration, pycnotic nuclei, and dilatation in sinusoids were significantly lower compared to the MTX group.
In the MTX group, glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes was lower compared to the control group. In the MTX + vitamin E group, glycogen accumulation in hepatocy- tes was higher compared to the MTX group.The flowcytometric apoptotic index (AI) percentage in the MTX group was 34.4% and in the MTX + vitamin E group the value was 9.4%.Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that vitamin E ameliorates MTX-induced liver damage.Co-using vitamin E and MTX drugs will be beneficial for the treatment of various diseases.Key words: methotrexate, vitamin E, flow cytometry, rats, liver.Address for correspondence: Dr.Ahmet U.Akman, Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Amasya University, Turkey, e-mail: ahmetugurakman@gmail.comClin Exp HEPATOL 2023; 9, 4: 359–367 DOI: https://doi.org/10.5114/ceh.2023.132251 Received: 4.05.2023, Accepted: 11.09.2023, Published: 27.10.2023 Introduction Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent from the antimetabolite group.
It is used in hemato- logical malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and many types of cancer such as osteosarcoma, head tumors, breast cancer, neck tumors, and also in in- flammatory and rheumatic diseases [1]. MTX affects the cell cycle and cells stop in the S phase [2].MTX inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate synthesis decreases the biosynthesis of thymidylate and purine nucleotides.This inhibition blocks DNA and RNA synthesis [3-6].MTX treatment may cause various side effects.One of the major side effects is hepatotoxicity [7, 8].The mechanism of liver damage related to MTX treatment is unknown; how- Clinical and Experimental Hepatology 4/2023360 Ahmet U.Akman, Zuleyha Erisgin, Sibel Turedi, Yavuz Tekeliogluever, there are some hypotheses.MTX inhibits nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-de- pendent mitochondrial enzymes.These mitochondrial enzymes are the main enzymes that produce NADPH.
MTX decreases NADPH level, which is essential for the enzyme glutathione reductase. Glutathione reduc- tase maintains the reduced glutathione level, which is an important protectant against reactive oxygen spe-cies.After MTX use, NADP levels and glutathione levels decrease; this event sensitizes hepatocytes to reactive oxygen radicals and causes hepatocyte dam-age [1].MTX is mostly metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidney.7-hydroxymethotrexate is the main metabolite of MTX.Within 24 hours of in- gestion, 7-OH methotrexate is excreted by renal filtra- tion and tubular reabsorption.Various amounts can be eliminated through the bile [9, 10].Vitamin E has 8 derivatives, which are 4 tocoph- erols and 4 tocotrienols [11-13].α-tocopherol is the strongest derivative of vitamin E activity [14].Anti- oxidant activity is the essential and very important function of vitamin E.The cell membrane phospholip- ids have unsaturated fatty acids.
They can be oxidized spontaneously, or after the challenge reaction of oxi-dant molecules they can be converted into peroxide derivatives. This mechanism is called lipid peroxida- tion [15, 16].Vitamin E inhibits this lipid degradation reaction and stops free radicals.It protects membranes against oxidative damage and provides membrane sta-bility [17, 18].Because of this feature, it is known as a chain-breaking antioxidant [16, 19].Vitamin E binds oxygen radicals before they damage the cell mem-branes, nucleic acids, and cell organelles.It has been revealed that in cases of vitamin E deficiency, free rad- icals damage cell membranes, and the flow of calcium ions into the cell increases [20, 21].Apoptosis is a specific cellular death mechanism which is genetically programmed and controlled.When cells complete their life period or are damaged, apoptosis provides the elimination of these damaged cells [22].
This type of apoptosis occurs under physio-logical conditions and it is also called physiological cell death [23]. After the signal for apoptosis, many changes occur in the cell such as shrinking shape, condensation of the nucleus, cytoskeletal breakdown, damage of the nuclear membrane, and fragmentation of nuclear DNA [24].Various changes occur during apoptosis in the outer surface of apoptotic cell membranes.The most prominent change is the translocation of phosphati-dylserine units.The use of antioxidants increases day by day to re- duce the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents.Our goal was to analyze the protective impact of vita-min E, as a strong antioxidant agent, against liver dam- age caused by MTX.Material and methods Ethics approval This study was carried out with the approval of the Karadeniz Technical University Local Animal Ethics Committee (No.201238).
The rats were obtained from the Animal Surgical Research Center of the Medical Faculty of Karadeniz Technical University. All experi-mental procedures were performed in the Animal Sur - gical Research Center of the Medical Faculty of Karad-eniz Technical University.Animals This study was carried out with the approval of the Karadeniz Technical University Local Animal Ethics Committee (No.201238).The rats were obtained from the Animal Surgical Research Center of the Medical Faculty of Karadeniz Technical University.All experi-mental procedures were performed in the Animal Sur - gical Research Center of the Medical Faculty of Karad-eniz Technical University.Thirty-two male Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old, 200-251 g) were used.All animals were kept in the lab-oratory at an average of 22 ±2°C temperature and the relative humidity was 50 ±5% on average.The rats were kept in a 12 hours light, 12 hours dark cycle.
The rats were given tap water with unlimited access and were fed with a standard regime. All animals were weighed daily and doses were calculated according to daily weight measurements.Chemicals Methotrexate was purchased from Koçak Farma (50 mg/5 ml injectable solution, Koçak Farma, Tekir- dağ, Turkey).Vitamin E was manufactured by Evigen (2 ml Aksu Farma, Istanbul, Turkey).Experimental design The rats were randomly split into four groups, each with 8 rats.The first group (control group) received only saline 2 ml (intraperitoneally – i.p.) for 5 days.The second group (MTX group) received 20 mg/kg MTX (i.p.) only on the initial day of the study.In the third group (MTX + vitamin E group): 20 mg/ kg MTX (i.p.) was applied only on the first day of the Clinical and Experimental Hepatology 4/2023361 Vitamin E and methotrexate-induced hepatic damagestudy and 100 mg/kg vitamin E (i.p.) was applied for 5 days during the study.
In the fourth group (Vitamin E group) 100 mg/kg of vitamin E (i.p.) was given for five days during the study. At the end of the 5 th day, ex- sanguination under the anesthesia method was used to sacrifice rats.Liver tissues were taken out and weighed.The right lobes of the liver were used for histopatho- logical examinations, and the left lobes of the liver were used for flow cytometry.Histopathological process Liver tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral form- aldehyde.After an increasing alcohol series, liver tissues were cleared in xylene.Then all tissues were embedded in paraffin and 5 μm thickness sections were taken from all paraffin blocks with a microtome (Leica RM 2255).Two consecutive section sets were taken from each paraffin block.All sections were stained with he- matoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Periodic acid Schiff (PAS).A light microscope was used to evaluate the sections (Olympus BX-51; Tokyo, Japan).All slides were exam-ined by an independent histologist.
In the H&E stained sections, five areas were selected by random sampling and the liver damage was semiquantitatively evaluated and degeneration of hepatocytes, pycnotic nucleus, dil- atation of sinusoids, infiltration of mononuclear cells, were examined according to a scoring system [25, 26]. Description and semiquantitative scoring system for histological damage graded: 0 to 3: 0 – none, 1 – mild, 2 – moderate, and 3 – severe.In the PAS-stained sec-tions, the glycogen accumulation of hepatocytes was examined.Flow cytometry Experimental process Paraffin blocks were deparaffinized chemically and mechanically using the method modified from Hedley [27, 28].Liver tissue samples were suspended and the suspension was passed through a nylon DNA mesh and particles were filtered (Spectramesh-nylon, 50-micron Backman-Coulter).The BD Pharmingen Pe ANNEXIN V Apoptosis Detection Kit was used to stain each suspension (Cat: 559763, Lot: 5306537).
Flow cytometry analysis was performed with the BD Accuri C6 Cytometer device and apoptosis peak per - centage rates detected in histograms were evaluated using the analysis program BD Accuri C6 Cytometer software (Version 1.0.264.21).Annexin V method in apoptosis and apoptotic index In apoptotic cells, phosphatidylserine is displaced from the inside to the outside of the plasma membrane. This is one of the major changes of apoptosis [29].An- nexin V is a distinctive protein that has the ability to bind to phosphatidylserine.Apoptotic cells can be de- scribed by defining them with a fluorescent compound such as FITC, which can connect to phosphatidylserine that is translocated to the cell’s outer surface.Flow cy- tometry can be used to determine the rate at which the FITC-Annexin-V complex binds to phosphatidylser - ine on the cell surface.
If the rate of association of the FITC-Annexin-V complex with phosphatidylserine is increased, it means that the percentage of apoptotic cells is increased [30-32]. Annexin V has higher sensitivity and specificity to separate normal cells from apoptotic cells [33].The apoptotic index is calculated by dividing the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells by the total number of cells in the gate [29].Statistical analysis SPSS Statistics (version 22) and Microsoft Excel pro- grams were used for data analysis.The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparisons between groups.The sta- tistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05.The Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test was used for paired comparisons in those with a significant Kruskal-Wallis test; the significance level was accepted as p < 0.0083.For histological liver damage scores, data were analyzed by one-way ANOV A and post hoc com- parisons were done using Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
P-value < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Results Liver weight measurement According to a statistical analysis of liver weights of all groups, there was no statistically significant differ - ence (p = 0.54) (Table 1).Table 1.Liver weights of experimental groups Groups (N = 32) Liver weights (g) Control group (n = 8) 12.575 ±0.9347 MTX group (n = 8) 12.138 ±1.3928 MTX + vitamin E group (n = 8) 11.737 ±1.7129 Vitamin E group (n = 8) 14.150 ±1.9420 There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.54).Clinical and Experimental Hepatology 4/2023362 Ahmet U.Akman, Zuleyha Erisgin, Sibel Turedi, Yavuz TekeliogluHistopathological results According to analyses of H&E staining, normal liver morphology was observed in the Control and Vitamin E groups.In the MTX group, atrophy in he- patocytes, sinusoidal dilatation and pycnotic nucleus were observed.Pycnotic nucleus sign was significantly higher compared to the control group.

Discussion Methotrexate has been used for many years in cancer chemotherapy, inflammatory, rheumatological, and autoimmune diseases [1]. Hepatotoxicity is a ma-jor side effect of MTX treatment.Hepatotoxicity is re- lated to the dose taken.It is frequently observed that high-dose MTX causes hepatotoxicity, so cancer treat-ment with MTX is negatively affected [34].Fig.2.Light microscopic sections of liver in different groups (PAS staining, 400×).A) Control group: Normal liver morphology and glycogen accumulation observed in control group A.B) MTX group: (∆ ) Pycnotic nucleus, (←) Vacuole in the hepatocyte cytoplasm, (→ ) Sinusoidal dilatation, (>) Glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes decreased, (↓) hydropic degeneration in hepatocytes around the vena centralis was observed.C) MTX + vitamin E group: (↑) There was a significant improvement in hepatocyte cytoplasm compared to the MTX group and an increase in glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes.

Akman, Zuleyha Erisgin, Sibel Turedi, Yavuz TekeliogluThe mechanism of hepatotoxicity that occurs after MTX treatment has not been fully defined [1].Previ- ous studies in the literature have observed that oxida- tive stress is a reason for MTX-induced hepatotoxicity, MTX-induced nephrotoxicity, and MTX-induced GIS toxicity [1, 35, 36].MTX decreases the reduced gluta-thione levels, which is an essential antioxidant that pro- tects cells against reactive oxygen radicals [1].Reactive oxygen products are continuously synthesized and de- stroyed in the liver.Oxidative stress, released reactive oxygen products and various cytokines cause damage to Kupffer and Ito cells around hepatocytes.If this effect continues, the hepatocytes go to apoptosis, and finally, fibrosis occurs [37, 38].
While chronic exposure to low- dose MTX causes fibrosis and cirrhosis, high-dose MTX causes sudden deterioration in liver function tests [39]. Various studies have shown that MTX treatment in the liver increases apoptosis and they used different anti- oxidants to improve this apoptosis and hepatotoxicity.Bu et al.[40] observed an increase of apoptosis in the liver with MTX and investigated that using rhein as an antioxidant that decreased apoptosis.Mahmoud et al .[41] studied MTX and found that apoptosis increased in the liver.They administered berberine as an anti- oxidant to reduce apoptosis in the liver.Also, Ali et al .[42] used MTX and found that apoptosis increased in liver hepatocytes.They administered chrysin as an anti- oxidant and reported that the apoptosis decreased with use of an antioxidant.Ali et al .[8] used MTX in the liver and observed that apoptosis increased in hepatocytes.
They administered chlorogenic acid as an antioxidant and found that the apoptosis decreased with use of an antioxidant. In another study, Mukherjee et al .[43] used MTX in the liver and observed that apoptosis in-creased.They administered pomegranate as an antiox-idant and found that the apoptosis decreased.In a dif- ferent study, Türk et al .[44] used MTX and observed that apoptosis increased in the liver.They adminis-tered zingerone as an antioxidant and reported that the apoptosis was decreased by using an antioxidant.In our study, we evaluated the response of vitamin E against the hepatotoxic effect of MTX.Vitamin E has been known for its strong antiox- idant effect for a long time and this effect has been Fig.3.

In numerous studies, vitamin E has been used for pre- venting different damage that may occur in the liver and other tissues [20, 21, 46-50].Vitamin E shows antioxidant activity by neutral- izing free radicals and oxygen radicals [17].
In etha- nol-dependent liver damage, free radicals have toxic effects on the liver and vitamin E protects the liver from these effects. In alcoholic liver disease, vitamin E levels decrease.Vitamin E treatment against the effects of alcohol has provided clinical benefits [21, 51, 52].If the damage of the liver is not identified in the early stages, irreversible damage begins from hepatocyte de-generation and the liver goes to fibrosis and cirrhosis [53].In cirrhosis, vitamin E levels have been found to be significantly low, and it is thought that vitamin E deficiency may play a role in cirrhosis etiopathogenesis [54, 55].As a strong antioxidant, various studies have shown that vitamin E decreases apoptosis in the liver and other tissues.Abdel-Daim et al .[47] demonstrated that fipronil induced hepatotoxicity and reported that apoptosis increased in hepatocytes.They used vita- min E to reduce apoptosis in the liver.Ibrahim et al .
[56] administered vitamin E for tramadol-induced hepatotoxicity. They observed a decrease in apoptosis in hepatocytes.Shen et al .[57] examined CCL4-in- duced hepatotoxicity and the increase of apoptosis in liver hepatic stellate cells.They found that vitamin E decreased apoptosis in stellate cells of the liver.Zhang et al.[58] investigated phoxim-induced hepatotoxicity and observed that apoptosis increased in hepatocytes.They reported that vitamin E decreased apoptosis in hepatocytes.Cuce et al .[59] demonstrated cyclophos- phamide-induced hepatotoxicity and found that apop-tosis was increased in hepatocytes.They administered vitamin E for its antioxidant effects and observed that apoptosis decreased in hepatocytes.In the literature, MTX has been given to rats in dif- ferent doses and ways of application.In our study, we administered MTX in a single dose of 20 mg/kg i.p.[1, 60].In one study MTX 20 mg/kg i.p.
was admin-istered as a single dose, then L-carnitine 500 mg/kg was used for five days, and liver tissues were examined histologically. Degeneration of hepatocytes, conges-tion of vascular structures, and dilatation of differ - ent sinusoids were observed in the MTX group [60].Similar to the results of this study, we found hepato-cyte degeneration, sinusoidal dilatation, and pycnotic nucleus findings in the MTX group.Pınar et al .[25] observed that necrosis in hepatocytes was increased, inflammation was increased, and vascular congestion was increased in the MTX group, and it was found that the antioxidant tempol prevented these effects.In our study, we used vitamin E, an antioxidant, against the hepatotoxicity of MTX.Similar to the results in this study, we observed that the use of vitamin E reduced liver damage.Tunali-Akbay et al.
[61] reported that in the MTX group, pathological findings – degenerated hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration – were observed in the microscopy, and histopathological im-provement was achieved in the liver tissue by giving resveratrol with MTX. Dalaklioglu et al .[62] reported that in the MTX group degeneration of hepatocytes, various vascular congestion, and dilatation of sinu-soids were seen in the liver.They used resveratrol as an antioxidant and observed that the tissue damage induced by MTX was improved.These findings were similar to our study.Akbulut et al .[63] reported that glycogen accumulation was lower in the MTX group compared to the control group.They used 3 different antioxidants; one of them was amifostine, the second was ascorbic acid, and the third was N-acetylcysteine, and they found that the glycogen accumulation in the liver was improved by their antioxidant effects.Again in a different study, Kose et al .
[64] noted that the mi- croscopic damage score was significantly increased with MTX treatment in rat liver, but the score was de-creased with montelukast treatment. In the PAS stain, the glycogen accumulation in the MTX group was de- creased.In our study, we were able to reduce the dam-age of MTX with vitamin E treatment and our PAS stain results were similar to this study.In our study, we also used flow cytometry and Annexin V for in- vestigating the change of apoptosis in different groups.Chen et al.[65] studied Annexin V and flow cytometry in an alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity experiment.They used hepatocyte cell culture and used S-allyl-l-cysteine as an antioxidant.They reported that alcohol increased the apoptosis in hepatocytes and by using an antioxi-dant the apoptosis decreased.They used flow cytom- etry to investigate the change in apoptosis value.Our apoptotic index results were similar to this study.Liu et al .
[66] studied Annexin V and flow cytometry in an ischemia-reperfusion model of rat liver. They used ascorbic acid (AA) and investigated the antioxidant ef- fect of AA with flow cytometry and histologically.They determined that using AA reduces the apoptosis of he-patocytes.Our findings in flow cytometry were similar to this study.In conclusion, MTX is a hepatotoxic drug.Hepa- totoxicity in cancer chemotherapy or the treatment of other diseases causes discontinuation in chemother - apy and prolongation of the treatment period.Long-term treatment can be dangerous or fatal for patients [67].Based on our histopathological and flow cytom- Clinical and Experimental Hepatology 4/2023366 Ahmet U.Akman, Zuleyha Erisgin, Sibel Turedi, Yavuz Tekeliogluetry results, hepatoxicity that occurs with MTX can be ameliorated with vitamin E.The combination of MTX with vitamin E will be helpful for the maintenance of treatment.Further studies can be designed by using different doses and durations.
