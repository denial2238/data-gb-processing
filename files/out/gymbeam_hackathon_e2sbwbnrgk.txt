Journal of the American Heart AssociationJ Am Heart Assoc.2024;13:e032390.DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.032390 1 ORIGINAL RESEARCH Bleeding Risk in Patients Receiving Omega- 3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids: A Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials Mustafa Javaid , MD; Kadhim Kadhim , MD, PhD; Bilal Bawamia , MD; Timothy Cartlidge , MD; Mohamed Farag , MD; Mohammad Alkhalil , DPhil, MRCP BACKGROUND: There is a potential concern about increased bleeding risk in patients receiving omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).The aims of this study- level meta- analysis were to determine the risk of bleeding and to assess whether this relationship is linked to the received dose of omega- 3 PUFAs or the background use of antiplatelet treatment.METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases were searched through May 2023 to identify randomized clinical trials of patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs.
Overall bleeding events, including fatal and central nervous system events, were identified and compared with those of a control group. A total of 120 643 patients from 11 randomized clinical trials were included.There was no difference in the pooled meta- analytic events of bleeding among patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs and those in the control group (rate ratio [RR], 1.09 [95% CI, 0.91–1.31]; P=0.34).Likewise, the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding were similar.A prespecified analysis was performed in patients receiving high- dose purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which demonstrated a 50% increase in the relative risk of bleeding but only a modest increase in the absolute risk of bleeding (0.6%) when compared with placebo.
Bleeding risk was associated with the dose of EPA (risk difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.05–0.43]; P =0.02) but not the background use of antiplatelet therapy (risk difference, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0]; P =0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Omega- 3 PUFAs were not associated with increased bleeding risk.Patients receiving high- dose purified EPA may incur additional bleeding risk, although its clinical significance is very modest.
Key Words: antiplatelet ■ bleeding ■ meta- analysis ■ polyunsaturated fatty acids The prognostic role of remnant cholesterol, includ - ing triglyceride- rich very low- density lipoprotein, in predicting cardiovascular outcomes has been highlighted in recent studies.1,2 Omega- 3 polyunsat - urated fatty acids (PUFAs) have triglyceride and very low- density lipoprotein cholesterol–lowering effect, and early studies illustrate an association between omega- 3 PUFAs and cardiovascular risk reduction.3,4 Nonetheless, clinical outcome data in favor of omega- 3 PUFAs are not consistent in demonstrating cardiovas - cular risk reduction.5,6 The dose and purity of omega- 3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been proposed as a potential explanation for the discor - dance in results of large randomized clinical trials.7 Nevertheless, the large reported absolute risk re - duction in the REDUCE- IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention) Trial appears to exceed the projected benefit of the lipid- lowering Correspondence to: Mohammad Alkhalil, DPhil, MRCP, Department of Cardiothoracic Services, Freeman Hospital, Freeman Rd, Newcastle- upon- Tyne NE7 7DN, United Kingdom.

DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.032390 2 Javaid et al Bleeding Risk and Omega- 3 Fatty Acidseffects of the omega- 3 PUFAs studied.5,7 Therefore, other pleotropic effects, including anti- inflammatory and antithrombotic mechanisms, have been pro - posed.7,8 Omega- 3 PUFAs are an integral component of platelet hemostasis that regulate platelet aggrega - tion and lower risk of thrombosis.9 These effects were evident in some clinical outcome studies, including the REDUCE- IT Trial, which reported numerically higher incidence of serious bleeding events when compared with placebo.5 Therefore, the aims of this study- level systematic review were to determine the risk of bleeding in pa - tients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs, including the risk of intracranial bleeding, and to assess whether there is a relationship with the received dose of EPA or the back - ground use of antiplatelet treatment.
METHODS The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses statement.10 Data in this systematic review are avail - able on reasonable request from the corresponding author. Institutional Review Board approval and con - sent form were waived (study- level meta- analysis).The MEDLINE, including PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception until May 2023 using the following keywords: atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, lipid, triglycerides, omega- 3, polyunsaturated fatty acids, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), very low- density lipoprotein, chylomicrons, remnant cho - lesterol, antiplatelet, antithrombotic , and bleeding .
Studies were included if they were randomized trials that compared PUFAs, omega- 3 fatty acids, or its downstream products, DHA or EPA, to placebo or standard treatment in patients with established car - diovascular disease or at high risk of developing car - diovascular disease. Clinical studies that assessed the role of triglyceride- lowering effect using non- omega- 3 PUFAs such as niacin or fibrates were excluded.Only studies reporting the incidence of bleeding events were included.Nonrandomized clinical trials, observational studies, conference abstracts, and studies published in languages other than English were not considered.Likewise, studies that included <1000 patients were excluded to minimize the risk of type 1 statistical error.All screened articles had initial assessment using the above prespecified inclusion criteria by 2 authors (MA and MJ), neither of whom was an investigator in any of the screened studies.Any case of disagreement was resolved by consensus.
All identified citations were initially screened at title or abstract level to assess their relevance to the current analysis. Subsequently, full reports were retrieved and included if they met the inclusion criteria.The references of the eligible studies were also searched for any additional relevant trials.The search results were cross- checked by reviewing systematic reviews and meta- analyses on triglyceride- lowering treatment.Data on study characteristics and outcomes of interest were extracted independently by 2 authors.Baseline clinical characteristics including use of an - tiplatelet treatment were recorded.Bleeding risk, in - cluding any bleeding, fatal, central nervous system or gastrointestinal bleeding were collated and recorded according to the definition within each study.
The ex - perimental arm was defined as the group that received omega- 3 PUFAs, whereas the control arm was as - signed to the group who received placebo (or standard treatment in studies that did not use placebo). Statistical Analysis Categorical variables are presented as percentages, while continuous data are presented as mean±SD or as a median (interquartile range) as reported in the original studies.To account for potential differences in study follow- up, treatment effect of omega- 3 PUFAs was re - ported using rate ratio (RR) and 95% CI, adjusted by patient- years.The summary RR was averaged across all included studies using random- effect model and based on the inverse variance method, as previously described.11,12 Funnel plot methodology was used to CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE What Is New?• Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were not associated with increased bleeding risk, includ - ing fatal and central nervous system events, when compared with control.

Meta- regression was performed using SPSS 28.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL) to assess the relationship between the difference in bleeding events in the group receiv - ing omega- 3 PUFAs compared with control against the proportion of patients receiving antiplatelet therapy or the dose of EPA. RESULTS The prespecified search strategy yielded 28 004 re - cords (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses flow diagram; Figure 1).Fifteen randomized clinical trials met inclusion criteria and were included in the current meta- analysis.The total number of patients was 120 643, of whom 60 360 (50.0%) received omega- 3 PUFAs.
Except for 2 stud- ies,5,14 all included studies used a combination of EPA and DHA in their assessment of omega- 3 PUFAs.The mean age in all the included studies was ≤75 years old, and patients were predominately male (Table ).14–21 There was a significant variation in the proportion of patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or receiving antiplatelet treatment across the studies. Visual inspection of the funnel plots was used to assess the risk of publication bias for studies report - ing any bleeding event ( Figure S1).There was mod- erate between- trial heterogeneity ( I2=65%, P=0.008); nonetheless, all included studies were randomized clinical trials and their data were reported according to intention- to- treat analysis.
There was no difference in the incidence of any bleeding events among patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs and those who did not (2.6% versus 2.4%; RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.91–1.31]; P =0.34; Figure 2).5,6,14,17,19,21,22 Similarly, the absolute risk was not different between the 2 treatment strategies (absolute risk, 0.07% [95% CI, −1.4% to 1.6%]). When data were restricted to ran - domized trials of icosapent ethyl (EPA only), the ad- ministration of high- dose purified EPA was associated with a 50% higher risk of any bleeding when compared with control (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.13–1.99]; P =0.006).However, the absolute increase in any bleeding re - mained very modest (absolute risk, 0.6% [95% CI, Figure 1.Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram of the selected studies.J Am Heart Assoc.2024;13:e032390.DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.032390 4 Javaid et al Bleeding Risk and Omega- 3 Fatty Acids0.1%–1.0%]) and translated into a number needed to harm of 166.
The risk of hemorrhagic stroke was comparable among patients who did or did not receive omega- 3 PUFAs (0.41% versus 0.32%; RR, 1.29 [95%, 0.92– 1.81]; P=0.14). The risk of hemorrhagic stroke was also similar when data were restricted to randomized tri - als of icosapent ethyl (RR, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.87– 1.84]; P=0.22; Figure 3).5,14,15,18 Additionally, there was no Table.Summary of Clinical Characteristics of the Included Studies Study name (year)No.

Meta- analysis of any bleeding events of included studies.Individual and pooled rate ratio and 95% CIs of patients receiving omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) vs control.J Am Heart Assoc.2024;13:e032390.DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.032390 5 Javaid et al Bleeding Risk and Omega- 3 Fatty Acidsdifference in the incidence of all intracranial bleed- ing events among patients in the 2 treatment groups (0.28% versus 0.31%; RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.64–1.26]; P=0.54).5,15,18 –20 Finally, omega- 3 PUFAs were not associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (3.1% versus 2.9%; RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.95–1.21]; P =0.27).There were no reports of fatal bleeding events in all the in - cluded studies.
When the administered EPA dose was plotted against the difference in bleeding risk between ome - ga- 3 PUFAs and control, there was a significant relationship between the increased bleeding risk in re - sponse to daily dose of EPA in grams (risk difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.05–0.43]; P =0.02; Figure 4). Such an association was not present between the proportion of patients receiving antiplatelet therapy and the dif - ference in bleeding risk in patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs compared with control (risk difference, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0]; P =0.056; Figure 4).
DISCUSSION The main findings of this study could be summarized as follows: (1) the incidence of any or central nervous sys - tem bleeding events were relatively low (2.6% and <1%, respectively); (2) omega- 3 PUFAs were not associated with an increased risk of overall, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding; (3) high- dose purified EPA was associated with increased bleeding risk, although the clinical significance is debatable; and (4) bleeding risk was associated with the dose of EPA rather than the background use of antiplatelet therapy.
Omega- 3 PUFAs were early recognized to be associated with favorable lipid profile and, subse - quently, were linked to improved clinical outcomes.7 However, randomized clinical trials did not consis - tently demonstrate incremental benefits when using omega- 3 PUFAs in reducing future cardiovascular risk.6,16,20,23 The REDUCE- IT trial reported a large absolute risk reduction from exposing patients with stable atherosclerotic disease to high- dose puri - fied EPA.5 This reduction was not proportionate to the change in patients’ lipid profile and suggested pleotropic effects of icosapent ethyl beyond its triglyceride- lowering effects.
The use of mineral oil as placebo in the REDUCE- IT trial may have magnified its results; nonetheless, its unfavorable impact on lipid and inflammatory profile was modest and un - likely to explain the difference in clinical outcomes.7,24 Anti- inflammatory, cell membrane stabilization and antiplatelet effects were all proposed as plausible mechanisms that could explain the large reduction in future cardiovascular risks in patients who were ex - posed to icosapent ethyl.7,25 –27 The antiplatelet effect of omega- 3 PUFAs is well- recognized and subsequent bleeding has been a po - tential concern for patients receiving this treatment.28 Figure 3.

DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.032390 6 Javaid et al Bleeding Risk and Omega- 3 Fatty AcidsIn fact, bleeding time, as well as EPA and DHA lev - els in platelets, were higher among Inuit people with high consumption of omega- 3 PUFAs when compared with other groups.29 This potential association has led to several recommendations advising patients to stop taking omega- 3 PUFAs before surgery or to delay elective procedures in patients consuming omega- 3 PUFAs.30,31 Nonetheless, randomized clinical trials did not demonstrate an increase in periprocedural bleed- ing risk in patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs.30–32 Likewise, there was no evidence to support increased bleeding events in patients who are considered at high bleeding risk when receiving omega- 3 PUFA.33 This in - cludes patients with gastrointestinal cancer or patients on intensive care units.33 Herein, we demonstrate that there is no increased risk of overall bleeding events in patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs.
Moreover, the incidence of serious bleeding, including hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial bleeding, was comparable be - tween the 2 groups.
Mechanistically, omega- 3 and omega 6 PUFAs are regulated using similar cyclooxygenase enzymes and are in direct competitive process to utilize these en - zymes.7,34,35 Therefore, any excess in the bioavailabil - ity of one would lead to a significant reduction in the conversion of the other into its active metabolites.7,34,35 Expectedly, the downstream metabolites of omega 6 PUFAs such as thromboxane and its precursor ara - chidonic acid are reduced in response to consump - tion of omega- 3 PUFAs with increased availability of their downstream metabolites such as EPA and pros - tacyclin.36,37 Although thromboxane A2 is a platelet activator, prostacyclin has antiplatelet effect and can induce vasodilation and smooth- muscle relaxation.26 Notably, our meta- analysis highlights an increase in bleeding risk only in patients receiving high- dose pu - rified EPA (icosapent ethyl). Moreover, we postulate a possible association between EPA dose and increased bleeding risk.
An EPA dose- dependent bleeding risk would be plausible, in line with the biochemical in - teractions between omega- 3 and omega 6 PUFAs. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that icosapent ethyl has no DHA component as active product and the purity of icosapent ethyl may also enhance pleotropic effects on platelet activation.EPA can increase the re - lease of nitric oxide, which is a potent inhibitor of plate - let aggregation and could potentially exacerbate the bleeding risk when using icosapent ethyl.38 Although DHA can also increase nitric oxide release, its effect on endothelial function was not similar to EPA.38 Moreover, its ability to inhibit oxidation of Apo- B- containing parti - cles was less sustained than that of EPA.38 Overall, the increase in bleeding risk associated with high- dose EPA was very modest.
The absolute in - crease in the overall bleeding risk was 0.6% with no ev - idence to suggest an increase in serious bleeding such as intracranial or hemorrhagic stroke. Furthermore, there was no relationship between bleeding events and the background use of antiplatelet treatment in patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs.In fact, the REDUCE- IT PCI substudy reported similar total bleeding events, includ - ing gastrointestinal and central nervous system bleed- ing, in patients with a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention who were randomly assigned to Figure 4.Meta- regression of difference in bleeding risk, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) dose, and background use of antiplatelet therapy.Left panel illustrates the significant relationship between the dose of EPA and increased bleeding risk among the included studies (the size of the bubble reflects the sample size of the study).The risk difference was calculated per 1- gram increase in EPA dose.
Right panel demonstrates the negative and nonsignificant association between the proportion of patients receiving antiplatelet treatment and the difference in bleeding in patients receiving omega- 3 PUFAs and control.

It included trial- level but not individual- level data; therefore, assessment of bleeding risk according to race or sex was not possi - ble. Although there was heterogeneity in the purity and dose of omega- 3 PUFAs across the included studies, we separately reported the bleeding outcomes in pa - tients receiving high- dose purified omega- 3 PUFAs (ie, icosapent ethyl).Bleeding events were defined ac - cording to the criteria used by each individual study and were not standardized when reporting patient outcomes.In conclusion, omega- 3 PUFAs were not associated with increased bleeding risk.Patients receiving high- dose purified EPA may incur additional bleeding risk, although its clinical significance is very modest and not evident when assessing serious bleeding.ARTICLE INFORMATION Received August 25, 2023; accepted January 26, 2024.
