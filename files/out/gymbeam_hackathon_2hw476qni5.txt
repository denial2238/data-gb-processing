ARTICLE OPEN Vitamin B6 de ﬁciency cooperates with oncogenic Rasto induce malignant tumors in Drosophila Eleonora Pilesi1,7, Giulia Tesoriere1,7, Angelo Ferriero1, Elisa Mascolo1, Francesco Liguori2,3, Luca Argirò1, Chiara Angioli1, Angela Tramonti4, Roberto Contestabile5,6, Cinzia Volontè2,3and Fiammetta Vernì1✉ © The Author(s) 2024 Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin which possesses antioxidant properties.Its catalytically active form, pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate (PLP), is a crucial cofactor for DNA and amino acid metabolism.The inverse correlation between vitamin B6 and cancer risk has been observed in several studies, although dietary vitamin B6 intake sometimes failed to con ﬁrm this association.However, the molecular link between vitamin B6 and cancer remains elusive.Previous work has shown that vitamin B6 de ﬁciency causes chromosome aberrations (CABs) in Drosophila and human cells, suggesting that genome instability may correlate the lack of this vitamin to cancer.
Here we provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Firstly, we show that PLP de ﬁciency, induced by the PLP antagonists 4-deoxypyridoxine (4DP) or ginkgotoxin (GT), promoted tumorigenesis in eye larval discs transforming benign RasV12 tumors into aggressive forms.In contrast, PLP supplementation reduced the development of tumors.We also show that low PLP levels, induced by 4DP or by silencing the sgllPNPOgene involved in PLP biosynthesis, worsened the tumor phenotype in another Drosophila cancer model generated by concomitantly activating RasV12and downregulating Discs-large (Dlg) gene.Moreover, we found that RasV12eye discs from larvae reared on 4DP displayed CABs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and low catalytic activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a PLP-dependent enzyme involved in thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis, in turn required for DNA replication and repair.Feeding RasV124DP-fed larvae with PLP or ascorbic acid (AA) plus dTMP, rescued both CABs and tumors.
The same effect was produced by overexpressing catalase in RasV12DlgRNAi4DP-fed larvae, thus allowing to establish a relationship between PLP de ﬁciency, CABs, and cancer. Overall, our data provide the ﬁrst in vivo demonstration that PLP de ﬁciency can impact on cancer by increasing genome instability, which is in turn mediated by ROS and reduced dTMP levels.Cell Death and Disease (2024) 15:388 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06787-3 INTRODUCTION The catalytically active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP), is an essential cofactor for a wide range of metabolic reactions mostly regulating amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism [ 1,2]; in addition, PLP participates, as a cofactor of serine hydroxymethyl-transferase (SHMT), to one-carbon (1 C) metabolism, involved in DNAsynthesis and methylation processes [ 3].Furthermore, vitamin B6 c a nq u e n c hr e a c t i v eo x y g e ns p e c i e s( R O S )[ 4–6] and it regulates both abiotic and biotic stress of plants [ 7].
In animals, PLP is recycled from food in a salvage pathway requiring the action of pyridoxalkinase (PDXK) and pyridoxine 5 ’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) enzymes [8]. Vitamin B6 is present in most foods, therefore a primary deﬁciency is uncommon in developed countries.However, a deﬁciency of vitamin B6 can develop as a secondary effect of several common pathologies including diabetes, celiac disease and bowel syndrome [ 8].In addition, PLP de ﬁciency is a condition often associated with pregnancy and can originate as a side effect ofmany common drugs including antibiotics such as isoniazid, penicillamine and cycloserine [ 9].Vitamin B6 has been inversely associated to the risk and/or survival of several cancers [ 10].Reduced serum levels of PLP, as well as impaired functional vitamin B6 status, as evaluated by the 3-hydroxykynurenine: xanthurenic acid ratio (HK:XA), have been for instance related to lung cancer risk [ 11–13].
Consistently, high expression levels of PDXK have been positively correlated to survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients [ 14]. Low levels of plasmatic PLP have been related also to colon-rectal cancer (CRC) risk in several studies [ 15–19], while high levels have been associated with improved survival among CRCpatients [ 20].In contrast, previous observational studies of dietary or dietary plus supplementary intake of vitamin B6 and CRC risk reportednonsigni ﬁcant positive or inverse associations [ 21,22].However a recent meta-analysis [ 23] including new studies [ 24,25] resolved this discrepancy.Works performed in mice and rats have shown that dietary vitamin B6 suppresses colon [ 26] and mammary tumorigenesis [ 27], thus indicating that animal models may help overcome limits Received: 20 December 2023 Revised: 26 May 2024 Accepted: 28 May 2024 1Dept.

In particular, it isthought that PLP de ﬁciency may compromise DNA synthesis [ 28], alter methylation pattern [ 29], promote angiogenesis [ 30], increase oxidative stress [ 31], promote in ﬂammation [ 32] and impair anti-tumor immunity [ 33]. However, the molecular basis of these mechanisms has yet to be elucidated.We and other authors have shown that PLP de ﬁciency causes chromosome aberrations (CABs) in yeast, Drosophila and human cells [ 34,35].In particular, we proved that CABs originate from both oxidative stress [ 35] and impaired SHMT activity which in turn reduces thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis [ 36].This ﬁnding led us to speculate that genome instability may link vitamin B6 with tumors.Consistent with this hypothesis, we also found that twoPLP antagonists, 4-deoxypyridoxine (4DP) and ginkgotoxin (GT), induce the development of epithelial cancers on the adult cuticle ofﬂies by promoting the loss of heterozygosity at the tumor suppressor warts (wts) locus [ 37].
In this work we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the possible role of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency in cancer. Drosophila is emerging as a valuable model to study multiple aspects of tumorformation and malignant transformations, due to the conservationof most signaling pathways involved in cancer; in addition, ﬂies are easy to manipulate genetically and have limited genetic redundancy.Most cancer research in Drosophila relied on the MARCM (mosaic analysis with repressible cell marker) strategy [38].This allows, by mitotic recombination, the generation of clones expressing a constitutively active form of Ras85D (Ras V12) that are, at the same time, mutants for tumor suppressors andmarked with the green ﬂorescent protein (GFP), for easy visualization.
The RasV12overexpression leads to benign hyper- plastic growth [ 39] thus, seminal works using MARCM method identi ﬁed mutations in genes involved in apical –basal polarity and in genes with mitochondrial functions or involved in autophagy that cooperate with RasV12to promote malignant traits [ 40–43]. In addition, several studies have successfully generated Drosophila models for lung, colorectal, brain and thyroid cancer, and forcancers that have been proven amenable to pharmacologic approaches [ 44–46].In the present work we exploited the advantages of using ﬂies to study the possible role of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency in tumor onset or development and to identify molecular links mainly correlated to genome stability.RESULTS Effect of PLP de ﬁciency on RasV12Drosophila cancer model We previously demonstrated that Drosophila melanogaster is a suitable model to study the impact of vitamin B6 on human health [35,47].
Here, we investigated the possible role of vitamin B6 deﬁciency in transforming benign RasV12in malignant forms of tumor, based on the notion that cancer is a multistep process [ 48]. Using the MARCM strategy [ 38] we generated larvae (hereinafter named RasV12larvae) in which clones expressing both RasV12and the green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) were produced on eye- antennal discs by an eyeless -speci ﬁcﬂippase enzyme (ey-FLP) via somatic recombination.PLP de ﬁciency was induced by feeding RasV12larvae with the PLP antagonist 4-deoxypyridoxine (4DP [ 49]).As a control, in addition to RasV12larvae reared on a standard medium, we generated larvae expressing only the GFP protein in eye disc clones, to monitor possible effects of 4DP on GFP expression.4DPfeeding leads to a 3-day delay in completion of larval develop- ment [ 47].Thus, third instar RasV124DP-fed larvae were examined at 11 days after egg laying (AEL) and compared to RasV12larvae at 8 days AEL.As reported in Fig.
S1 older larval age of RasV124DPlarvae did not in ﬂuence the phenotype. 4DP feeding did not signi ﬁcantly alter GFP expression in control larvae (Fig.1A, B).In contrast, it stimulated the proliferation of eye disc clones in RasV12 larvae, thus increasing the percentage of GFP-positive eye ﬁeld area/ total body area with respect to control diet (10% vs 6%) (Fig.1A, B).Accordingly, eye disc cells from RasV124DP larvae stained for phospho-Histone H3 (pH3), a speci ﬁc marker for mitotic cells, displayed an increased mitotic index (MI) (Fig.1E, F).Feeding RasV12larvae with gingkotoxin (GT), another PLP antagonist of PLP synthesis [ 49], yielded the same results (Fig.1A, B), thus con ﬁrming the speci ﬁcity of the effect.In contrast, PLP administration prevented tumor development (Fig.1A, B), further reinforcing the role of PLP de ﬁciency in RasV12tumor transformation.RasV12larvae treated with PLP antagonists displayed secondary tumors far from the cephalic region (Fig.1A).
To quantify them, we analyzed the invasions on the larval brain ventral nerve cord (VNC) according to [ 41] and found that 4DP feeding caused VNC invasions in 29% of examined brains vs 4.1% in controls. GTtreatment yielded VNC invasions (21.7%), whereas, in contrast, PLPsupplementation strongly reduced migration (6.4%) (Fig.1C, D).We also tested 4DP on a cancer model in which Ras V12was expressed in all cells of the eye disc, ﬁnding the same results (Fig.S2).Basement membrane (BM) degradation represents a crucial early step in the onset of cell spreading and metastasis [ 50].Thus, to further con ﬁrm the association between PLP de ﬁciency and secondary tumors, we assayed the BM integrity in eye discs from RasV124DP-fed larvae.The immunostaining with an anti-Perlecan antibody which represents a major BM component [ 51] yielded localized loss of Perlecan (Fig.2A, B).
Moreover, RasV124DP eye discs displayed an accumulation of Mmp1, a matrix metallopro- teinase involved in BM breakdown [ 50] (Fig. 2C, D and S3), thus suggesting that vitamin B6 de ﬁciency enhances the BM break- down to facilitate the spreading of transformed cells.It has been shown in Drosophila that cancer cells can move from the primary tumor site and travel through the hemolymph (a ﬂuid analogous to blood) to reach secondary sites [ 52].Consistently, we found that 54% of RasV124DP-fed larvae displayed GFP cells into the hemolymph (Fig.2E, F).In contrast, GFP cells were found only in the hemolymph of 8% of RasV12 larvae reared on a control diet and never found in control larvae (expressing only the GFP) reared on 4DP or on a control diet.By considering that not all the cells ﬂoating in the hemolymph are able to settle in distant sites [ 52] these results are in line with those of VNC invasions (Fig.
1C, D) and suggest that 4DP feeding can favor the migration of GFP cells through the hemolymph, allowing those who ﬁnd suitable conditions to colonize distant sites. PLP de ﬁciency exacerbates the cancer phenotype of RasV12 DlgRNAitumors To con ﬁrm the role of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency in cancer, we used also another ﬂy cancer model (RasV12DlgRNAi), in which the expression of RasV12in the entire eye-antennal disc, combined with the RNAi-induced silencing of Discs large (Dlg) polarity gene, produces neoplastic tumors able to metastasize [ 41].4DP feeding further enlarged the cephalic area of RasV12DlgRNAilarvae compared to control diet (13.4% vs 10%) (Fig.3A, B) and produced VNC invasions in 85% of brains (vs 48.6%) (Fig.3C, D).4DP induced a more aggressive phenotype compared to the control diet,yielding a higher percentage of severe (Type 3) VNC invasions (Fig.3C).In contrast, PLP feeding signi ﬁcantly reduced the phenotype (Fig.
3A, B, D) In addition, we genetically induced PLP de ﬁciency by silencing the sgllPNPOgene involved in PLP biosynthesis [ 53]. Consistent with the effect produced by 4DP, we found an increased cephalic area (13.8%) and VNC invasion in66.6% of brains (Fig.3D).E.Pilesi et al.2 Cell Death and Disease (2024) 15:388 Overall, these data indicate that PLP de ﬁciency also impacts on this second cancer model, by speci ﬁcally increasing the malig- nancy of RasV12DlgRNAitumors and triggering tumor progression.PLP de ﬁciency causes chromosome damage in RasV12eye discs PLP depletion causes chromosome aberrations (CABs) in Droso- phila , yeast, and human cells [ 35,34,54].As CABs are well-known hallmarks of tumor initiation and progression [ 55], genome instability could play a major role in cancer induced by PLP deﬁciency.
To test the validity of this hypothesis, we ﬁrstly examined eye discs from RasV124DP-fed larvae for the presence of chromosome damage in DAPI-stained preparations, ﬁnding 10.2% of CABs vs 1.4% in untreated RasV12larvae (Fig. 4A, B).Of note, 4DP treatment combined to RasV12expression produced a highereffect (10.2%) than the sum of the individual conditions (4DP 3%; RasV121,4%) (Chi square test, P < 0.001), thus suggesting that chromosome damage in RasV124DP discs may result from a synergistic interaction between PLP de ﬁciency and the activated Ras (Fig.4B).CABs were also found in RasV12DlgRNAieye discs from larvae reared in 4DP and were rescued by PLP (Fig.4A, B).Consistent with the notion that CABs result from improperly repaired DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) [ 56], 4DP treatment produced an accumulation γ-H2Av, a marker of DSBs [ 57], in both RasV12and RasV12DlgRNAitumor cells (Fig.4C, D).PLP treatment in addition to rescue tumor development (Figs.
1and 3) also rescued CABs in eye discs from RasV12and RasV12DlgRNAi4DP-fed larvae (Fig. 4A, B).More interestingly, overexpression of Catalase involved in endogenous ROS Fig.1 PLP de ﬁciency cooperates with RasV12in tumorigenesis.A ey>GFP RasV12and ey>GFPcontrol larvae reared on cd (a,c), 4DP (b,d) GT (e) or 4DP +PLP (f).ey>GFP RasV12larvae express both the oncogenic RasV12and the GFP protein in eye disc clones; control larvae express only the GFP protein in eye disc clones.Ectopic expression of RasV12alone only induces mild tumor growth (c).RasV124DP and RasV12GT tumors display signi ﬁcant overgrowth (d,e), which can be rescued by PLP supplementation (f).Secondary tumors far from cephalic area are indicated by arrows.cd =control diet; 4DP =4-deoxypyridoxine; GT =gingkotoxin; PLP =pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate.Scale bar, 0.5 mm.BQuanti ﬁcation of GFP-positive eye ﬁeld area relative to total body area.Error bars, SEM.**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns =not signi ﬁcant (P=0.0605) (unpaired t-test).

4 Cell Death and Disease (2024) 15:388 part from decreased dTMP availability, in turn caused by reduced SHMT catalytic activity [ 35,36]. This is consistent with the role of vitamin B6 as antioxidant molecule [ 59–62] and with its role as a cofactor of SHMT, whose reaction yields 1 C units that ultimatelyproduce thymidylate (dTMP) required for DNA synthesis and repair [ 3].To investigate if the origin of CABs was the same also in PLP de ﬁcient RasV12cells, we examined eye discs from RasV124DP- fed larvae by evaluating ROS accumulation and measuring thecatalytic activity of SHMT.As shown in Fig.5A, B, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining revealed that eye discs from RasV124DP-fed larvae accumulated, in GFP-labeled clones, more ROS compared toRasV12discs from larvae reared on a control diet.In contrast, feeding RasV124DP-treated larvae with the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) or PLP counteracted the formation of ROS (Fig.5A, B).
In addition, eye discs from 4DP-fed RasV12larvae displayed a reduced catalytic activity of SHMT, compared to discs from RasV12larvae fed a standard diet (Fig. 5D and S5).Given the role of SHMT in folate cycle this result suggests that discs from RasV124DP-fed larvae undergo a reduced biosynthesis of dTMP (Fig.5C).Role of oxidative stress and reduced activity of SHMT in tumors induced by PLP de ﬁciency To better correlate the oxidative stress and the reduced activity of SHMT with tumors induced by PLP de ﬁciency and to shed light on their relative contributes, we fed ﬂies with AA and dTMP alone or in combination, ﬁnding a complete rescue of both CABs and primary tumors, which further con ﬁrmed the role of CABs in 4DP-induced cancers (Fig.6A-C and S6).CAB frequency decreased from 9.92% to 0.59% (Fig.6C), the percentage of GFP-labeled area decreased from 9.25% to 4.42% (Fig.6A, B), and the frequency of VNC invasions decreased from 29% to 7.7%(Fig.6D).
Feeding RasV124DP larvae with AA yielded a complete rescue of both chromosome damage (CABs =0.54%) (Fig. 6C and S6), primary and secondary tumors (cephalic area =4.71%; VNC invasions =8.0%) (Fig.6A, B, D).The same effect was obtained with alpha-lipoic acid, another strong antioxidant (Fig.S7).Supplementation with dTMP produced a less pronounced rescueof CABs with respect to AA (2.45%) (Fig.6C and S6), and a Fig.3 PLP de ﬁciency increases proliferation and malignancy of RasV12DlgRNAitumors.A ey>GFP RasV12DlgRNAiand control larvae reared on cd (a,d), 4DP (b,e) or 4DP +PLP(g).Larvae in c and f panels also carry the hairpin RNAi construct of the sgllPNPOgene.Scale bar, 0.5 mm.cd=control diet; 4DP =4-deoxypyridoxine; PLP =pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate.( RasV12DlgRNAilarvae express the oncogenic RasV12in all eye disc cells, the hairpin RNAi construct of the Dlggene and the GFP construct; ey>GFP control larvae express in all eye disc cells only the GFP construct).

6A, B) and secondary tumors (VNC invasions =10.2%) (Fig. 6D).Taken together these results suggested that both SHMT depletion and ROS accumulation may have a role in CABproduction induced by PLP de ﬁciency in RasV12, and also that they may synergize to increase the genome instability, thus predisposing cells to malignant transformation.Since dTMP is involved in DNA metabolism, its depletion may compromise therepair of lesions caused by ROS.Furthermore, in agreement withprevious studies indicating that the knockout of SHMT2 increases ROS production in human cancer cells [ 63], dTMP supplementa- tion reduced DHE staining of about 50% (Fig.6E, F) in eye discs from Ras V124DP-fed larvae, thus suggesting that under PLP deﬁciency dTMP depletion, may also contribute to increase the oxidative stress, besides compromising repair (Fig.
6G).In conclusion, altogether, these results provide robust evidence that vitamin B6 de ﬁciency can impact on RasV12cancers and that this effect may be mediated by increased genome instability, in turn produced by the concerted action of ROS accumulation anddecreased dTMP biosynthesis. DISCUSSION Our study, carried out in Drosophila , provides the ﬁrst compelling evidence that vitamin B6 de ﬁciency affects cancer by promoting genome instability.In addition, it identi ﬁes two main mechanisms by which genome damage is produced in PLP de ﬁcient cells: increased ROS formation and reduced SHMT activity.Several studies inversely correlated micronutrient plasma levels and human cancer risk.However, although many micronutrients E.Pilesi et al.
6 Cell Death and Disease (2024) 15:388 are potential cancer promoting candidates because of their functional and biochemical properties, the establishing of aprecise cause-effect relationship between diet and cancer in bothobservational epidemiological studies and intervention trials has proved challenging [ 64]. Using animal models may enable not only to establish these relationships more clearly, but also toidentify underlying molecular mechanisms.Among the animal cancer models, the common fruit ﬂyi s emerging as a precious resource for cancer biology and metabolic studies [ 65], since it offers a valuable toolkit with various advantages including high genetic conservation of major meta- bolic and cancer pathways and similar drug response to mammals.
Here we have shown that PLP de ﬁciency, induced by 4DP feeding, is able to transform benign Ras V12cancers in more aggressive forms capable of generating secondary tumors as demonstrated by (i) migration of GFP cells into the brain VNC, (ii) membrane basement degradation, (iii) accumulation of Mmp1,and (iv) presence of GFP cells into the hemolymph of RasV124DP- fed larvae. The ﬁnding that even ginkgotoxin (GT), another antagonist of PLP [ 66], is able to transform RasV12tumors further corroborates our results.In addition, we have shown that PLP de ﬁciency can also impact on the RasV12DlgRNAicancers, worsening their aggressiveness.Interestingly, the speci ﬁc depletion of Sgll/PNPOinRasV12DlgRNAi eye discs displayed the same effect as 4DP feeding, allowing us to exclude a major role of systemic effects of 4DP on cancer phenotypes.Although several studies were focused on the involvement of vitamin B6 in cancer [ 10,22], the underlying mechanisms are still elusive.
We and other authors have previously demonstrated that PLP de ﬁciency yields CABs and micronuclei in Drosophila and human cells, respectively, thus suggesting that genome instabilitymay mediate the role of PLP in cancer [ 35,54]. CABs can, indeed, provide growth bene ﬁts to precancerous cells or promote cancer progression by impacting on the formation of hybrid genes or the deletion of tumor suppressor genes [ 67,68].Here we have shown that eye discs from RasV124DP-fed larvae displayed CABs, accumulated ROS and exhibited a reduced SHMT catalytic activity, in line with previous studies indicating that CABs originate fromoxidative stress and reduced dTMP biosynthesis in PLP de ﬁcient cells [ 35,36].Additionally, we provided robust evidence that CABs represent a major cause of tumors in PLP de ﬁcient larvae.
By acting on the mechanisms that generate CABs in PLP depletedcells (such as ROS accumulation and dTMP depletion), we fedlarvae with a diet made of AA +dTMP, ﬁnding a rescue of bothCABs and tumors. Furthermore, overexpressing the Catalase gene inRas V12DlgRNAitumor cells we also found that both 4DP-induced CABs and tumors were strongly reduced.To investigate the relative roles of ROS accumulation and SHMT depletion in 4DP-induced tumors, we have supplied AA and dTMP separately.The complete rescue obtained with AA diet suggeststhat dTMP works downstream to ROS or, alternatively, that dTMPbiosynthesis plays only a modest role.However, the ﬁnding that dTMP diet can rescue CABs and tumors would favor the ﬁrst hypothesis.Thus, based on the role of dTMP in DNA synthesis andrepair and on our ﬁnding that dTMP diet decreases ROS accumulation, we propose the following model that links, PLP deﬁciency, CABs, and cancer together (Fig.5G).
Due to the ability of PLP to scavenge ROS both directly and indirectly [ 8], in PLP-de ﬁcient cells, weakened cellular antioxidant defenses, would increase the production of ROS, which attack DNA leading to the formation of DSBs, thus predisposing cells tocancer. Meanwhile, a reduced availability of PLP cofactor wouldreduce the biosynthesis of dTMP by affecting the catalytic activity of SHMT, thus amplifying the oxidative stress by both altering the repair of DNA ROS-induced lesions and increasing the productionof ROS.Regarding the effect of dTMP depletion on the ROSincrease, we do not have a molecular explanation, however our results are consistent with studies showing that inhibitors of thymidylate synthase, the enzyme directly involved in dTMPbiosynthesis (Fig.5C), can increase intracellular ROS by activating the enzyme NADPH oxidase and promoting apoptosis [ 69].Similarly, the mitochondrial SHMT2 knockdown in bladder cancercells leads to ROS accumulation and apoptosis [ 63].
We can, therefore, hypothesize that, in our model, 4DP treatment causes a less severe reduction of dTMP synthesis compared to SHMT knockdown or to a TS inhibition, thus allowing some cells withDNA damage to escape apoptosis and go towards cancertransformation. Although we did not examine secondary tumors for chromo- some damage, the ﬁnding that AA and dTMP diets alone or in combination rescue the phenotype may anyhow suggest that genome instability triggered by the concerted action of dTMP depletion and ROS increase may also contribute to the spread oftumor cells.In this work, we considered only CABs and DSBs as genome damage endpoint, however we expect that a part of genome instability depends also on mutations due to DNA base oxidation(such as 8-oxo-2 ’-deoxyguanosine, 8 oxo-dG) and erroneous incorporation of dUTP into DNA.In line with this hypothesis,Fig.4 PLP de ﬁciency causes CABs and accumulation of γ-H2Av foci in RasV12and RasV12DlgRNAieye discs.

Pilesi et al.7 Cell Death and Disease (2024) 15:388 vitamin B6 in mice signi ﬁcantly suppressed colon cancer induced by azoxymethane (AOM) by decreasing levels of oxidative stress markers including 8 oxo-dG [ 31].Moreover, cytosolic SHMT1 knockdown increased dUTP incorporation in lung cancer cells [ 70].Finally, we can also hypothesize that the decreased catalytic activity of SHMT due to PLP de ﬁciency may also alter the chromatin methylation patterns, thus contributing to RasV12 transformation [ 71]; this hypothesis will be tested in future studies.In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that PLP de ﬁciency triggers cancer development in Drosophila and more importantly, we identi ﬁed genome instability as an important player.
Although vitamin B6 is present in most foodsand hence an overt de ﬁciency of this vitamin is rare, reduced PLPlevels are associated with several common pathologies including diabetes and malabsorption syndromes [ 8]. Thus, applied to humans, our results may suggest the importance of evaluating the genome integrity as a biomarker of cancer risk factor in all thecontexts of reduced availability of vitamin B6.MATERIALS AND METHODS Fly stocks y,w eyFlp; Act >y+> Gal4 UAS GFP; FRT82B, Tub Gal80 was kindly provided by T.Xu lab (Yale School of Medicine).UAS RasV12/ UAS RasV12; FRT82B/ FRT82B was kindly provided by Hirabayashi lab (London, Institute of Medical Science).Fig.5 PLP de ﬁciency causes ROS formation and reduced activity of SHMT in RasV12eye discs.A ROS accumulation in eye discs from ey>GFP control larvae reared on cd or 4DP and from ey>GFP RasV12larvae reared on cd, 4DP , 4DP +PLP or 4DP +AA.

Treatments All stocks were maintained and crossed at 25 °C on a standard medium containing in 100 mL: 0.68 g agar, 6.52 g yeast, 3 g ﬂour, 600 µL propionic acid, and 5.13 g sucrose. PLP antagonists such as 4-deoxypyridoxine (4DP, Sigma Cat.No.D0501) and ginkgotoxin (GT, Sigma Cat.No.89960), as well as pyridoxal 5’phosphate (PLP, Sigma Cat.No.P9255), were dissolved in the standard medium at 2 mM, 0.2 mM and 0.5 mM ﬁnal concentrations, respectively.4DP and PLP concentrations were chosen according to [ 35]; GT concentration according to [ 72].Deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP, Merck Cat.No.T7004 ‐100MG) was dissolved in the standard medium at 200 μM concentration.This concentration was established by adapting the concentration used in in vitro experiments to the oral administration [ 36].Ascorbic acid (Sigma Cat.No.A 5960) was dissolved to standard medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 40 mM according to [ 73].Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA, Sigma Cat.No.
T1395) was added to medium at 2 mM concentration according to [ 35].Analysis of larvae Larvae were immobilized by keeping them for at least 4 hours in PBS at 4 °C, and then examined under the ﬂuorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss -Thornwood, NY) equipped with an HBO100W mercury lamp and a cooledcharged ‐coupled device (CCD camera; Photometrics CoolSnap HQ). The GFP-labeled area measurements were performed on the acquired pictures using imageJ software.Larvae from at least 5 independent experiments have been examined.Analysis of isolated brains Brains from wandering third-instar larvae were dissected in PBS, and thedistribution patterns of GFP clones were examined in optical lobes andventral nerve cords (VNCs) under the ﬂuorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss).The invasions of GFP clones from their original sites (eye-antennal discs and optical lobes) to VNCs were considered secondary tumors.Brains from 3 independent experiments have been analyzed.
Chromosome cytology To analyze chromosome aberrations (CABs), eye discs from third instarlarvae were dissected in saline (NaCl 0.7%). Metaphases were exposed tocolchicine ( ﬁnal concentration 10 -5M) for 1 hr.The eye discs were then incubated in the hypotonic solution (sodium citrate 0.5%) for 7 minutes, squashed in 45% acetic acid, frozen in liquid nitrogen and mounted inVectashield H ‐1200 with 4,6 diamidino ‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).Observations were carried out using a ZeissAxioplan ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with CCD camera (Photo- metrics CoolSnap HQ).To assay the effect of AA, dTMP or AA +dTMP in vitro, eye discs dissected from Ras V124DP third instar larvae were incubated in 2 ml of saline supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco BRL) for 4 hourswith addition of 50 µM dTMP according to [ 36] or 5 mM AA.One hour before ﬁxation colchicine ( ﬁnal concentration, 10−5M) was added to the saline/FBS to collect metaphases.
Discs were then ﬁxed with the standard procedure above described. To calculate the percentage of CABs we arbitrarily assigned only ﬁve CABs to each cell with multifragmented chromosomes.Immuno ﬂuorescence Eye imaginal discs from third instar larvae were dissected in PBS and ﬁxed in a 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 minutes on a rotating wheel at RT.Fixed tissues were then washed twice in a PBS 0,3% Triton (PBT) solution for 10 minutes and blocked in a PBT 5% Normal Donkey Serum (NDS) solution for 45 minutes.Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C withprimary antibody solution.The day after, eye discs were washed twice in PBT and then incubated for 3 hours in the dark with.After two 10-minutes washes, samples wereincubated in a DAPI solution for 30 minutes to stain nuclei.Finally, onceFig.6 The combined effect of ROS accumulation and dTMP depletion promotes both genome instability and cancer development in RasV124DP eye discs.

The primary antibodies were: rabbit anti-Perlecan (1:1000 diluted in PBT 1% NDS, a gift of L.Pierre, Institute Curie, Paris, France); mouse anti Mmp1 (a cocktail of antibodies against Mmp1 catalytic domain #3B8D12 and #5H7B11, from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:50 diluted inPBT 1% NDS, a gift of T.Vaccari, Università degli studi di Milano, Italy).The secondary antibodies were: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-555- conjugated (1:600 diluted in PBT 1% NDS, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Cat.No.A31572); donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated (1:600 diluted in PBT 1% NDS, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Cat.No.A32773) and donkey anti- rabbit Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated (1:600 diluted in PBT 1% NDS, ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc Cat.No.A32795).
Immuno ﬂuorescence analysis was performed through a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM800, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with fourlaser lines: 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 639 nm. For each imaginal disc at least ten slices were acquired through Z-stack technology.The brightness and contrast of the digital images were adjusted using Zeiss Zen software3.0 blue edition (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe,San Jose, CA, USA).The rate of BM damage was measured by analyzing each slice of each imaginal disc, scoring 120 images for each experimental condition.Fluorescence intensity of Mmp1 on eye discs was measured using the Image J software.Immunostaining for pH3 and γ-H2Av was performed on eye discs from third instar larvae dissected and ﬁxed as described in [ 74].After several rinses in phosphate buffered saline 0.1% Triton (PBS-T) eye discpreparations were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodiesdiluted in PBT.
After two rinses in PBT primary antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody. We used the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-phospho-Histone H3 (pSer10)Sigma-Aldrich Cat.No.06570 (1:50, a gift of M.Gatti, Sapienza University ofRome, Italy) and rabbit anti-Histone H2AvD pS137 (1:100; Rockland Cat.No.600-401-914).Secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:300 in PBT; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Cat.No.A31572).Immunostained preparations were mounted in Vectashield H-1200.Observations were carried out using a Zeiss Axioplan ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with CCD camera (Photometrics CoolSnap HQ).Theγ-H2AV positive cells were quanti ﬁed on the acquired pictures using Adobe Photoshop 2022 version 23.5.5.Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining To evaluate ROS accumulation, third instar larval eye-antennal imaginal discs were dissected in Schneiders medium (Gibco, Cat.No.
21720024 ) and incubated in 30uM Dihydroethidium (DHE) (Thermo Fisher Cat. No.D23107) in PBS dye solution for 5 minutes in a dark chamber, on orbitalshaker at room temperature.DHE is oxidized by superoxide radical toform 2-hydroxyethidium which intercalates with DNA and provides signalat 550 nm in cells where ROS are produced [ 75].After 3 washes in Schneiders medium and 1 wash in PBS on an orbital shaker at room temperature, discs were immediately mounted in DAPI Vectashield.Images were immediately captured using the confocal microscope.Quanti ﬁcation was performed by using ImageJ/Fiji plugin to count spots (Spot Counter Plug-in version 0.14) and was expressed as DHE positivepuncta/eye disc area.Analysis of GFP cells into the hemolymph Hemolymph was extracted from 20 larvae as described in [ 76].20 µL of hemolymph was mixed on a slide with 5 µL of DAPI and examined undertheﬂuorescence microscope at 20x magni ﬁcation.
GFP cells were counted on acquired pictures using Photoshop software (2022 v23.5.5). SHMT activity measurement Measurement of SHMT activity was performed using a radioisotope assay based on the ability of SHMT to catalyze the exchange of the pro ‐2S proton of glycine with solvent [ 77].Protein extracts obtained from about 100 discs in 20 mM K ‐phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP‐40 and 5 mM 2 ‐mercapto ethanol, were incubated with tritiated [23H] glycine (23 nmol/L) at 30 °C for 4 h and treated as previously described[78].The experiment was repeated four times, duplicates were used each time and the radioactivity was normalized to total protein content, determined with Bradford ’s assay.Statistical analysis All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) from at least three independent experiments.Statistical signi ﬁcance was per- formed using the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Chi square test as indicated in each ﬁgure legend.
P < 0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant.
